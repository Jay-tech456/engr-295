    "message_1": "Here's a specific problem for the student to solve: \n\nA toroidal solenoid with a square cross-section has 10 turns per unit length and an inner radius of 5 cm and an outer radius of 10 cm. If a current of 2 A flows through the toroid, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 8 cm from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a toroidal solenoid, the magnetic field is in the circumferential direction, and its magnitude is constant along a circle of radius r (in this case, 8 cm). Therefore, we can simplify the integral as:\n\nB * ∮ dl = B * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop at a radial distance of 8 cm. Since the solenoid has 10 turns per unit length, the total number of turns enclosed by the loop can be calculated as:\n\nTurns_enclosed = Turns_per_unit_length * (Outer_radius - Inner_radius)\nTurns_enclosed = 10 turns/cm * (10 cm - 5 cm) = 50 turns\n\nThe total current enclosed by the loop is the product of the number of turns and the current per turn:\n\nI_enclosed = Turns_enclosed * Current_per_turn\nI_enclosed = 50 turns * 2 A/turn = 100 A\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 100 A) / (2π * 0.08 m)\n\nB ≈ (4 × 10^(-5) T·m) / 0.08 m\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 8 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 5 × 10^(-4) T or 0.5 mT."
