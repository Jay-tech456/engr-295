    "message_1": "A lens has a focal length of 20 cm and a refractive index of 1.5. If the radius of curvature of one of its surfaces is 30 cm, what is the radius of curvature of the other surface?",
    "message_2": "To find the radius of curvature of the other surface, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nWe are given f = 20 cm, n = 1.5, and R1 = 30 cm. We need to find R2.\n\n1/20 = (1.5 - 1) * (1/30 - 1/R2)\n\n1/20 = 0.5 * (1/30 - 1/R2)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.5:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 - 1/R2\n\nNow, let's solve for 1/R2:\n\n1/R2 = 1/10 + 1/30\n\n1/R2 = 3/30 + 1/30\n\n1/R2 = 4/30\n\nNow, find R2:\n\nR2 = 30/4\n\nR2 = 7.5 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the other surface is 7.5 cm."
