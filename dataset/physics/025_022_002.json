    "message_2": "The force required for a cell undergoing mitosis to physically split into two daughter cells depends on several factors, including the size and type of the cell, the mechanical properties of the cell membrane, and the cytoskeleton. During the process of cytokinesis, the cell membrane is pinched inwards by a contractile ring composed of actin and myosin filaments. This constriction generates the force necessary to split the cell into two daughter cells.\n\nEstimating the exact force required for cytokinesis is challenging due to the complex nature of the process and the variability between different cell types. However, some studies have attempted to measure this force. For example, a study on fission yeast cells estimated the force exerted by the contractile ring to be around 0.4 to 4 nN (nanonewtons) (Stachowiak et al., 2014). Another study on mammalian cells suggested that the force generated by the contractile ring could be in the range of 10-100 nN (Mayer et al., 2010).\n\nThe force required for cytokinesis can vary between different types of cells due to differences in cell size, shape, and mechanical properties. Larger cells may require more force to split, while cells with stiffer membranes may require higher forces to deform the membrane during cytokinesis. Additionally, the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton can also influence the force generation during cell division.\n\nIn summary, the force required for a cell undergoing mitosis to physically split into two daughter cells depends on various factors and can vary between different types of cells. More research is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the forces involved in cytokinesis across a wide range of cell types.\n\nReferences:\n\nMayer, M., Depken, M., Bois, J.
