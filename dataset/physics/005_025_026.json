    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic energy of the electron, we need to use the given equation:\n\nE = sqrt(p^2c^2 + m0^2c^4)\n\nwhere:\np = 1.6 x 10^-19 kg m/s (momentum)\nm0 = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg (rest mass of the electron)\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nNow, plug in the values into the equation:\n\nE = sqrt((1.6 x 10^-19)^2 * (3 x 10^8)^2 + (9.109 x 10^-31)^2 * (3 x 10^8)^4)\n\nE = sqrt(7.68 x 10^-38 + 7.426 x 10^-16)\n\nE = sqrt(7.426 x 10^-16)\n\nE â‰ˆ 8.617 x 10^-9 J\n\nThe relativistic energy of the electron with a momentum of 1.6 x 10^-19 kg m/s in a vacuum is approximately 8.617 x 10^-9 Joules."
