    "message_2": "To calculate the change in internal energy of the system, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W).\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nIn this case, the gas releases 1000 Joules of heat, so Q = -1000 J (since heat is released, it's negative). Now, we need to determine the work done by the system.\n\nIf we assume that the gas undergoes an isochoric process (constant volume), then the work done by the system is zero, as there is no change in volume. This is a reasonable assumption since we don't have any information about the volume or pressure changes.\n\nW = 0\n\nNow we can calculate the change in internal energy:\n\nΔU = Q - W\nΔU = -1000 J - 0\nΔU = -1000 J\n\nThe change in the internal energy of the system is -1000 Joules."
