    "message_2": "The correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the luminosity of a quasar in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is known as the M-sigma relation or the black hole mass-luminosity relation. This relation suggests that the mass of the central black hole is directly proportional to the luminosity of the quasar.\n\nThe M-sigma relation can be expressed as:\n\nM_BH ∝ L_quasar^α\n\nwhere M_BH is the mass of the central black hole, L_quasar is the luminosity of the quasar, and α is a constant that depends on the specific AGN population being studied. The value of α is typically found to be around 1.2 to 1.5 in various studies.\n\nThe physical basis for this relation is thought to be related to the accretion of matter onto the central black hole. As matter falls into the black hole, it forms an accretion disk around it. The gravitational energy released during this process is converted into radiation, which is emitted as light, contributing to the quasar's luminosity. The more massive the black hole, the more matter it can accrete, and thus the more luminous the quasar.\n\nIt is important to note that this relation is an empirical one, derived from observations of various AGNs. While it has been well-established, the exact physical processes that drive this correlation are still an area of active research in astrophysics."
