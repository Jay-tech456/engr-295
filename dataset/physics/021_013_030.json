    "message_2": "Black holes can affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in several ways, primarily through gravitational lensing and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect.\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Black holes have immense gravitational fields that can bend the path of light passing near them. This bending of light can cause the CMB radiation to be lensed, creating distortions in the observed CMB temperature and polarization patterns. The lensing effect can magnify or demagnify the CMB radiation, depending on the alignment of the black hole, CMB, and the observer. This phenomenon can be used to study the distribution of mass in the universe, including the presence of black holes.\n\nObservational evidence: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have observed the CMB lensing effect caused by massive objects, including black holes. These observations help to constrain the mass distribution in the universe and provide indirect evidence of black holes' influence on the CMB radiation.\n\n2. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect: When CMB photons pass through a region containing hot electrons, such as those surrounding a black hole, they can gain energy through inverse Compton scattering. This process shifts the CMB radiation's frequency spectrum, creating a distortion known as the SZ effect. The SZ effect can be used to study the properties of galaxy clusters and the black holes within them.\n\nObservational evidence: Observations of the SZ effect have been made using various instruments, such as the Planck satellite, the SPT, and the ACT. These observations have provided valuable information about the distribution of hot gas in galaxy clusters and the presence of black holes.\n\nIn summary, black holes can affect the CMB radiation through gravitational lensing and the SZ effect. Observational evidence supporting these phenomena has been provided by various instruments, including the ACT, SPT, and Planck satellite. These observations help us understand the distribution of mass in the universe and the properties of black holes."
