    "message_2": "Mott scattering is the elastic scattering of charged particles (like alpha particles) by the Coulomb field of atomic nuclei. The Mott scattering cross section, which is a measure of the probability of scattering, depends on the atomic number (Z) of the target nucleus and the incident energy (E) of the alpha particle.\n\nThe differential Mott scattering cross section can be expressed as:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z * e^2 / (4 * E))^2 * (1 / (1 + (k * sin(θ/2))^2))^2\n\nwhere:\n- dσ/dΩ is the differential cross section per unit solid angle\n- Z is the atomic number of the target nucleus\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n- E is the incident energy of the alpha particle\n- k is the wave number of the alpha particle (k = 2 * π / λ, where λ is the wavelength)\n- θ is the scattering angle\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the Mott scattering cross section depends on the atomic number (Z) and the incident energy (E) of the alpha particle.\n\n1. Dependence on atomic number (Z):\nThe cross section is proportional to Z^2, which means that as the atomic number of the target nucleus increases, the probability of scattering also increases. This is because a larger atomic number corresponds to a stronger Coulomb field, which has a greater influence on the trajectory of the alpha particle.\n\n2. Dependence on incident energy (E):\nThe cross section is inversely proportional to E^2, which means that as the incident energy of the alpha particle increases, the probability of scattering decreases. This is because higher energy alpha particles have a shorter wavelength and are less likely to be deflected by the Coulomb field of the target nucleus.\n\nIn summary, the Mott scattering cross section increases with increasing atomic number and decreases with increasing incident energy of the alpha particle."
