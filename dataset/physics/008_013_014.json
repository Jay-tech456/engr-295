    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is the heaviest of the three charged leptons, with a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c². It is an unstable particle with a very short lifetime of around 2.9 x 10⁻¹³ seconds. Due to its short lifetime, the tau lepton decays before it can interact via the strong force. Its decay modes can be classified into two main categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic decays:\nIn leptonic decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter charged lepton (either an electron or a muon) and two neutrinos. The leptonic decay modes are:\n\na) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅_τ (Electron decay mode)\nb) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̅_τ (Muon decay mode)\n\nThese decay modes are mediated by the weak force through the exchange of a W⁻ boson.\n\n2. Hadronic decays:\nIn hadronic decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles composed of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes can be further divided into one-prong and multi-prong decays, depending on the number of charged particles produced.\n\na) One-prong decays: These decays involve the production of a single charged hadron, typically a charged pion (π⁻) or a charged kaon (K⁻). Examples include:\n\n- τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ\n- τ⁻ → K⁻ + ν_τ\n\nb) Multi-prong decays: These decays involve the production of multiple charged hadrons. Examples include:\n\n- τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁰ + ν_τ\n- τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁻ + ν_τ\n- τ⁻ → K⁻ + π⁺ + π⁻ + ν_τ\n\nThe hadronic decays are also mediated by the weak force through the exchange of a W⁻ boson, which subsequently decays into quarks that form the final state hadrons.\n\nThe decay modes of the tau lepton can provide insights into its properties and the fundamental interactions governing its behavior. For instance, the fact that the tau lepton decays via the weak force confirms its participation in the electroweak interaction. Additionally, the relative probabilities of different decay modes can be used to test the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics and search for potential new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, the study of tau lepton decays can help improve our understanding of CP violation, which is crucial for explaining the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe."
