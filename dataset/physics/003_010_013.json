    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field intensity at a point along the axis of a long cylindrical conductor, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) passing through the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's law is given by:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long cylindrical conductor, we can assume that the magnetic field is uniform and circles around the axis of the conductor. We can choose a circular loop of radius x (x > r) centered at the axis of the conductor as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field (B) is tangential to the loop, and the differential length element (dl) is also tangential to the loop. Therefore, the dot product B⋅dl = Bdl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's law for our chosen loop:\n\n∮Bdl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe integral of the differential length element around the loop is equal to the circumference of the loop:\n\nB(2πx) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field intensity (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πx)\n\nHere, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in amperes, and x is the distance from the axis of the conductor to the point where we want to find the magnetic field intensity.\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at a point along the axis of a long cylindrical conductor of radius 'r' carrying a steady current of 'I' amperes is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πx)"
