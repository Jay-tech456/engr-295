    "message_2": "The maximum amount of distortion, or strain, that a gravitational wave can induce on the crust of a neutron star before causing it to crack depends on the properties of the neutron star's crust, such as its composition, temperature, and the strength of its magnetic field. \n\nThe crust of a neutron star is composed of a lattice of nuclei and free electrons, which can be approximated as an elastic solid. The breaking strain, or the maximum strain that the crust can withstand before cracking, is determined by the balance between the attractive nuclear forces and the repulsive Coulomb forces between the charged particles in the lattice.\n\nNumerical simulations and theoretical calculations suggest that the breaking strain for the crust of a neutron star is on the order of 10^-1 (or about 0.1). This means that a gravitational wave would need to induce a strain of about 0.1 or greater to cause the crust to crack.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual breaking strain could be higher or lower depending on the specific properties of the neutron star's crust. Additionally, other factors, such as the presence of strong magnetic fields or the influence of the neutron star's dense interior, could also affect the crust's response to gravitational waves."
