    "message_2": "The most common decay mode of the tau lepton is its decay into a tau neutrino and a hadron, specifically a charged pion. This decay mode is called the leptonic decay mode and has a branching ratio of about 11.5%. The final state particles produced in this decay mode are the tau neutrino (ντ) and a charged pion (π±).\n\nIn comparison, the electron and muon have different decay modes. The electron is stable and does not decay, as it is the lightest charged lepton. The muon, on the other hand, decays via a two-body decay into a muon neutrino (νμ) and an electron (e±) or a positron (e∓), along with an electron neutrino (νe) or an electron antineutrino (ν̅e). This decay mode is called the muon decay or Michel decay.\n\nThe main difference between the decay modes of the tau lepton and those of the electron and muon is that the tau lepton can decay into both leptonic and hadronic final states, while the electron is stable and the muon decays only into leptonic final states. Additionally, the tau lepton has a much shorter lifetime compared to the muon, making its decay processes occur more rapidly."
