    "message_2": "The relationship between the distribution of dark matter and the rotation curves of galaxies is a key piece of evidence for the existence of dark matter. The rotation curve of a galaxy is a plot of the orbital velocities of stars and gas as a function of their distance from the galaxy's center. According to classical physics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the velocities to decrease as we move further away from the center of the galaxy. However, observations show that the velocities remain constant or even increase in the outer regions of galaxies, which is not consistent with the distribution of visible matter alone.\n\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light but does exert gravitational force. The concentration of dark matter in and around galaxies affects the observed velocities of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies.\n\nAs the concentration of dark matter increases, it contributes more mass to the galaxy, which in turn increases the gravitational force acting on the stars and gas in the outer regions. This causes the orbital velocities of these objects to be higher than what would be expected based on the visible matter alone. The flat or increasing rotation curves observed in galaxies can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, with the dark matter providing the additional mass needed to account for the observed velocities.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter in galaxies is closely related to the observed rotation curves. The concentration of dark matter affects the velocities of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies, providing additional gravitational force that keeps the rotation curves flat or increasing, which cannot be explained by the distribution of visible matter alone. This relationship between dark matter and rotation curves is a strong piece of evidence supporting the existence of dark matter in the universe."
