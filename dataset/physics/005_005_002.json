    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by the astronauts on the spaceship compared to someone on Earth, we need to use the formula for time dilation in the context of special relativity, which is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere Δt' is the dilated time experienced by the astronauts, Δt is the proper time experienced by someone on Earth, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the spaceship travels at a velocity of 0.8c relative to the black hole, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(0.36)\n\nΔt' = Δt / 0.6\n\nThe time dilation factor is 1/0.6 ≈ 1.67. This means that for every second experienced by someone on Earth, the astronauts on the spaceship will experience approximately 1.67 seconds."
