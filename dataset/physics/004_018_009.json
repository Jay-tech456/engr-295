    "message_2": "The relationship between the wavelength shift of light emitted at a high gravitational potential and the gravitational redshift effect predicted by general relativity is described by the gravitational redshift formula. This formula states that the change in wavelength (Δλ) of light emitted from a massive object is proportional to the change in gravitational potential (ΔΦ) between the source and the observer.\n\nThe gravitational redshift formula is given by:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔΦ/c^2\n\nWhere:\n- Δλ is the change in wavelength (redshift)\n- λ is the initial wavelength of the light\n- ΔΦ is the change in gravitational potential between the source and the observer\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum\n\nThis relationship is a direct consequence of general relativity, which predicts that the presence of a massive object will cause spacetime to curve, and this curvature affects the propagation of light. As light moves away from a massive object, it has to \"climb\" out of the gravitational potential well, which causes its energy to decrease and its wavelength to increase (redshift).\n\nExample:\n\nConsider a star with a mass M and radius R. An observer is located at a distance r from the center of the star, where r > R. We want to find the gravitational redshift of light emitted from the surface of the star and observed by the observer.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the change in gravitational potential between the surface of the star and the observer's location:\n\nΔΦ = Φ_r - Φ_R = (GM/r) - (GM/R)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nNow, we can use the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔΦ/c^2 = [(GM/r) - (GM/R)]/c^2\n\nSuppose the star has a mass of 2 x 10^30 kg (about the mass of the Sun) and a radius of 7 x 10^8 m (about the radius of the Sun). The observer is located at a distance of 1.5 x 10^11 m from the center of the star (approximately 1 astronomical unit). The initial wavelength of the light emitted from the star's surface is 500 nm.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = [(6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2)(2 x 10^30 kg)/1.5 x 10^11 m - (6.674 x 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2)(2 x 10^30 kg)/7 x 10^8 m] / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 2.12 x 10^-6\n\nTo find the change in wavelength (Δλ), multiply the initial wavelength (λ) by the calculated ratio:\n\nΔλ = λ * (Δλ/λ) = 500 nm * 2.12 x 10^-6 ≈ 1.06 x 10^-3 nm\n\nSo, the light emitted from the surface of the star will be redshifted by approximately 1.06 x 10^-3 nm when observed at a distance of 1 astronomical unit. This is a small but measurable effect, and it provides experimental evidence for the predictions of general relativity."
