    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying at a speed of Mach 2.5 in air at standard sea level conditions. If it encounters a shock wave at an angle of 30 degrees, how will the speed and pressure behave in front and behind the shock wave? Calculate the magnitude of the pressure jump across the shock wave.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the oblique shock wave relations. The oblique shock wave angle (β) is given as 30 degrees, and the Mach number (M1) of the supersonic aircraft is 2.5. We will first find the Mach number behind the shock wave (M2) and then calculate the pressure ratio (P2/P1) across the shock wave.\n\n1. Find the Mach angle (µ) using the Mach number (M1):\n\nµ = arcsin(1/M1)\nµ = arcsin(1/2.5)\nµ = 23.58 degrees\n\n2. Find the wave angle (θ) using the oblique shock wave angle (β) and Mach angle (µ):\n\nθ = β - µ\nθ = 30 - 23.58\nθ = 6.42 degrees\n\n3. Use the Mach number (M1) and wave angle (θ) to find the deflection angle (δ) using the Prandtl-Meyer function:\n\nν(M1) = ν(M2) + δ\n\nThe Prandtl-Meyer function is given by:\n\nν(M) = √[(γ+1)/(γ-1)] * arctan[√((γ-1)/(γ+1))*(M^2-1)] - arctan(√(M^2-1))\n\nWhere γ (gamma) is the ratio of specific heats for air, which is approximately 1.4.\n\nFirst, we need to find ν(M1):\n\nν(M1) = √[(1.4+1)/(1.4-1)] * arctan[√((1.4-1)/(1.4+1))*(2.5^2-1)] - arctan(√(2.5^2-1))\nν(M1) = 59.96 degrees\n\nNow, we can find the deflection angle (δ):\n\nδ = ν(M1) - θ\nδ = 59.96 - 6.42\nδ = 53.54 degrees\n\n4. Use the deflection angle (δ) to find the Mach number behind the shock wave (M2):\n\nν(M2) = ν(M1) - δ\nν(M2) = 59.96 - 53.54\nν(M2) = 6.42 degrees\n\nNow, we need to find M2 using the inverse Prandtl-Meyer function:\n\nM2 = 1.752\n\n5. Calculate the pressure ratio (P2/P1) using the normal shock relations and oblique shock relations:\n\nP2/P1 = (2*γ*M1^2 - (γ-1))/(γ+1)\nP2/P1 = (2*1.4*(2.5)^2 - (1.4-1))/(1.4+1)\nP2/P1 = 4.50\n\nThe pressure jump across the shock wave is 4.50 times the initial pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mach number behind the shock wave (M2) is 1.752, and the pressure ratio (P2/P1) across the shock wave is 4.50. The speed behind the shock wave will be lower than in front of the shock wave, and the pressure behind the shock wave will be 4.50 times higher than in front of the shock wave."
