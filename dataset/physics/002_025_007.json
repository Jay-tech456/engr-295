    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat of the mixture, we need to find the specific heat of each component (oxygen and nitrogen) and then find the weighted average based on their mass fractions.\n\nThe specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) for diatomic gases like oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCv = (5/2) * R\n\nwhere R is the specific gas constant. The specific gas constant for oxygen (O2) is 259.8 J/(kg·K) and for nitrogen (N2) is 296.8 J/(kg·K).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cv for each gas:\n\nCv_O2 = (5/2) * 259.8 J/(kg·K) = 649.5 J/(kg·K)\nCv_N2 = (5/2) * 296.8 J/(kg·K) = 742.0 J/(kg·K)\n\nNext, we need to find the mass fraction of each gas in the mixture:\n\nmass_fraction_O2 = 8 kg / (8 kg + 12 kg) = 8/20 = 0.4\nmass_fraction_N2 = 12 kg / (8 kg + 12 kg) = 12/20 = 0.6\n\nNow, we can calculate the specific heat of the mixture using the weighted average:\n\nCv_mixture = (mass_fraction_O2 * Cv_O2) + (mass_fraction_N2 * Cv_N2)\nCv_mixture = (0.4 * 649.5 J/(kg·K)) + (0.6 * 742.0 J/(kg·K))\nCv_mixture = 259.8 J/(kg·K) + 445.2 J/(kg·K)\nCv_mixture = 705 J/(kg·K)\n\nSo, the specific heat of the mixture containing 8 kg of oxygen gas and 12 kg of nitrogen gas at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 705 J/(kg·K)."
