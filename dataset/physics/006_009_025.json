    "message_2": "To find the change in the wavelength of X-rays when they are scattered at an angle of 60 degrees by an atom of silver, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle in radians.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the scattering angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/3))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.738 x 10^-22 Js/m) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ = 0.242 x 10^-12 m\n\nSince the incident X-ray wavelength is given in nanometers, we can convert the change in wavelength to nanometers:\n\nΔλ = 0.242 x 10^-12 m * (1 x 10^9 nm/m) = 0.242 nm\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of X-rays when they are scattered at an angle of 60 degrees by an atom of silver is approximately 0.242 nm."
