    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (∆G) associated with the binding of a protein and its ligand, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = -RT ln(Kd)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310.15 K), and Kd is the equilibrium constant (10^-6 M).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n∆G = -(8.314 J/mol·K) × (310.15 K) × ln(10^-6 M)\n\n∆G = -8.314 × 310.15 × (-13.82)\n\n∆G ≈ 35,600 J/mol\n\nSo, the change in free energy (∆G) associated with the binding of a protein and its ligand is approximately 35,600 J/mol."
