    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a helium atom when an electron is removed from its 1s orbital can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nIonization Energy (IE) = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere:\n- IE is the ionization energy\n- Z is the atomic number (number of protons) of the element\n- n is the principal quantum number of the electron's orbital\n\nFor a helium atom, Z = 2 (since it has 2 protons) and n = 1 (since the electron is in the 1s orbital).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nIE = -13.6 eV * (2^2 / 1^2)\nIE = -13.6 eV * (4 / 1)\nIE = -54.4 eV\n\nSince ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron, we need to consider the absolute value of the result:\n\nIE = 54.4 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a helium atom when an electron is removed from its 1s orbital is 54.4 eV."
