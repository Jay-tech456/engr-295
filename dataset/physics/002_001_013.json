    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the temperature of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. We are given the initial pressure (P = 2 atm), initial volume (V = 4 L), and number of moles (n = 2 moles). We can use the value of R = 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) for the ideal gas constant. Solving for T:\n\n2 atm * 4 L = 2 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * T\n\n8 L atm = 0.1642 L atm / K * T\n\nT = 48.74 K\n\nNow we can calculate the work done during the isothermal expansion:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nW = 2 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 48.74 K * ln(8 L / 4 L)\n\nW = 2 * 0.0821 * 48.74 * ln(2)\n\nW = 8.0084 * ln(2)\n\nW â‰ˆ 5.54 L atm\n\nThe work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 5.54 L atm."
