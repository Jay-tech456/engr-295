    "message_2": "According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, if the light ray is incident at an angle of 30 degrees, the angle of reflection will also be 30 degrees.\n\nTo draw the path of the reflected ray, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a plane mirror as a straight line.\n2. Draw a normal (perpendicular) line to the mirror at the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror.\n3. Draw the incident ray at a 30-degree angle to the normal line.\n4. Draw the reflected ray at a 30-degree angle to the normal line on the opposite side of the normal line from the incident ray.\n\nNow, let's find the lateral shift of the reflected ray. The lateral shift is the horizontal distance between the point where the incident ray would have reached if it continued straight without reflecting and the point where the reflected ray actually reaches.\n\nTo find the lateral shift, we can use trigonometry. Since the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are both 30 degrees, we can use the sine function to find the lateral shift.\n\nLet's denote the lateral shift as \"d\" and the distance from the mirror surface as \"h\" (which is 10 cm in this case). We can write the equation:\n\nsin(30) = d / h\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd = h * sin(30)\n\nSince sin(30) = 0.5, we have:\n\nd = 10 cm * 0.5\nd = 5 cm\n\nSo, the lateral shift of the reflected ray is 5 cm."
