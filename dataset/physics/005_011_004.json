    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass (1000 kg), v is the velocity (0.8c), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the denominator of the formula:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.64) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = 1000 kg / 0.6 = 1666.67 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the spaceship as it approaches the star is approximately 1666.67 kg.\n\nTo find the energy required to accelerate the spaceship to this velocity, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (m - m0) * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the relativistic mass (1666.67 kg), m0 is the rest mass (1000 kg), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference between the relativistic mass and the rest mass:\n\nm - m0 = 1666.67 kg - 1000 kg = 666.67 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n\nE = 666.67 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 666.67 kg * 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nE = 5.999 x 10^19 Joules\n\nThe energy required to accelerate the spaceship to this velocity is approximately 6 x 10^19 Joules."
