    "message_2": "The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly in the observed rotation curves of galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity should decrease with increasing distance from the center. However, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotation curves remain flat or even slightly increase with distance, which is inconsistent with the distribution of visible matter alone.\n\nThis discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter led to the hypothesis of dark matter. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact with normal matter through gravitational forces. The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies provides additional mass, which affects the gravitational pull on visible matter and thus influences the rotation curves.\n\nThe evidence supporting the interaction between dark matter and normal matter comes from various observations and simulations:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: As mentioned earlier, the flat rotation curves of galaxies indicate the presence of an additional mass component, which can be explained by the existence of dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground can be used to map the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters. These observations reveal that the total mass of galaxy clusters is much greater than the mass of visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Observations of the CMB reveal fluctuations in temperature and density, which can be used to infer the distribution of matter, including dark matter, in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Numerical simulations: Computer simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, which include the effects of dark matter, are able to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters, providing further support for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between dark matter and normal matter is essential for explaining the observed rotation curves of galaxies and other astrophysical phenomena. Multiple lines of evidence, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB observations, large-scale structure, and numerical simulations, support the existence of dark matter and its interaction with normal matter through gravitational forces."
