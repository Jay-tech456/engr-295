    "message_2": "The maximum possible mass of a stable neutron star according to general relativity is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The exact value of the TOV limit depends on the equation of state of the neutron star's matter, which is still a subject of ongoing research. However, most estimates place the TOV limit at around 2 to 2.5 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun).\n\nWhen a neutron star exceeds this mass limit, the gravitational force becomes too strong for the degeneracy pressure of neutrons to counterbalance it. As a result, the star undergoes gravitational collapse. During this process, the core of the star is compressed to extremely high densities, and the escape velocity at the surface of the collapsing object exceeds the speed of light. This leads to the formation of an event horizon, beyond which no information or matter can escape. The collapsing object thus becomes a black hole."
