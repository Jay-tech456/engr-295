    "message_1": "A particle of mass m is moving with velocity v1 when it collides head-on with another particle of mass 2m which is initially at rest. If after the collision, the two particles move off together, find the final velocity v2 of the two-particle system in terms of v1. Assume a perfectly elastic collision.",
    "message_2": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's first consider the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is given by the momentum of the first particle (mass m and velocity v1) plus the momentum of the second particle (mass 2m and velocity 0, since it's initially at rest).\n\nInitial momentum = m * v1 + 2m * 0 = m * v1\n\nAfter the collision, the two particles move off together with a final velocity v2. The final momentum of the system is given by the total mass (m + 2m) times the final velocity v2.\n\nFinal momentum = (m + 2m) * v2 = 3m * v2\n\nNow, we can set the initial momentum equal to the final momentum and solve for v2:\n\nm * v1 = 3m * v2\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\nv1 = 3 * v2\n\nNow, solve for v2:\n\nv2 = v1 / 3\n\nSo, the final velocity of the two-particle system is v2 = v1 / 3."
