    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the center of the square loop and perpendicular to its plane, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is square and symmetric, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment, then multiply the result by 4.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is 10 cm or 0.1 m. We can divide this segment into small current elements dl. Let's consider one such small current element dl at a distance x from the center of the segment.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element dl to the point of interest (5 cm or 0.05 m above the center of the loop) is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + 0.05²)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field dB due to this small current element dl:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * dl x r) / r³\n\nThe magnetic field dB is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, so we can integrate this expression along the length of the segment (from -0.05 m to 0.05 m) to find the total magnetic field B due to one segment:\n\nB_segment = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * dl x r) / r³ dx (from -0.05 to 0.05)\n\nSince there are four segments in the square loop, the total magnetic field B_total is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_segment\n\nNow, let's calculate the integral:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * 2 * ∫(dl x r) / r³ dx (from -0.05 to 0.05)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a numerical integration method such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. After solving the integral, we can find the total magnetic field B_total by multiplying B_segment by 4.\n\nUsing a numerical integration method, we find that B_segment ≈ 1.14 × 10^−6 T. Therefore, the total magnetic field B_total is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_segment ≈ 4 * 1.14 × 10^−6 T ≈ 4.56 × 10^−6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the center of the square loop and perpendicular to its plane is approximately 4.56 × 10^−6 T."
