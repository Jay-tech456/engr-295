    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and stars, as well as on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is the residual thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang, which occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. The CMB is a nearly uniform radiation field that fills the universe, with tiny fluctuations in temperature and density. These fluctuations provide crucial information about the early universe and the formation of cosmic structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nDark matter plays a significant role in the formation of these structures and, consequently, in the fluctuations observed in the CMB. The gravitational influence of dark matter affects the distribution of visible matter and the way it clumps together. This, in turn, affects the density and temperature fluctuations in the CMB.\n\nIn the early universe, dark matter and ordinary matter were coupled together through gravitational interactions. As the universe expanded and cooled, the density fluctuations in the dark matter and ordinary matter caused them to collapse and form structures. The presence of dark matter amplified these density fluctuations, leading to the formation of the large-scale structures we observe today.\n\nThe fluctuations in the CMB are directly related to the density fluctuations in the early universe. By studying these fluctuations, we can learn about the composition of the universe, including the amount of dark matter. Observations of the CMB have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and have helped refine our understanding of its properties and distribution.\n\nIn summary, dark matter affects the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation by influencing the distribution and clumping of visible matter in the early universe. The study of these fluctuations has provided crucial insights into the composition of the universe, including the presence and properties of dark matter."
