    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant (αs) is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. This means that αs decreases as the energy scale increases.\n\nAt the center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the Z boson, the value of the strong coupling constant has been measured with high precision by various experiments. According to the 2020 Review of Particle Physics by the Particle Data Group (PDG), the value of αs(mZ) is:\n\nαs(mZ) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011\n\nThis value is based on a global analysis of various experimental data, including measurements from electron-positron annihilation, deep inelastic scattering, and hadron collider processes.\n\nSo, at the center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, the strong coupling constant αs is 0.1181 with an uncertainty of ±0.0011."
