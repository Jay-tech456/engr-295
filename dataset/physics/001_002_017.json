    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the momentum, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position (Δx) as 1.0 x 10^-10 m, we can solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nΔp ≥ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1.0 x 10^-10 m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of the electron is approximately 5.27 x 10^-25 kg m/s."
