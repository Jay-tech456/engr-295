    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving horizontally (parallel to the Earth’s surface) at a speed of 0.8c relative to the Earth. A light beam is emitted perpendicular to the spacecraft's direction of motion. What is the angle at which the light beam appears to be moving from the perspective of an observer on the Earth? Use relativistic aberration of light to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle at which the light beam appears to be moving from the perspective of an observer on Earth, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ)))\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the angle of the light beam as seen by the observer on Earth\nθ is the angle of the light beam as seen by the spaceship (90 degrees in this case, since it's emitted perpendicular to the direction of motion)\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c)\nc is the speed of light\nγ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(90°) / (1.667(1 + (0.8c/c)cos(90°)))\nsin(θ') = 1 / (1.667(1 + 0))\nsin(θ') = 1 / 1.667\n\nθ' = arcsin(1 / 1.667) ≈ 36.87°\n\nSo, the angle at which the light beam appears to be moving from the perspective of an observer on Earth is approximately 36.87 degrees."
