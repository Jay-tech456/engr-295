    "message_1": "A beam of light travels from air to glass with an angle of incidence of 45 degrees. If the refractive index of glass is 1.5, what is the angle of refraction?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), and θ1 = 45 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(45) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071 (approx.)\n\n0.7071 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.7071 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.4714 (approx.) = sin(θ2)\n\nNow, to find the angle of refraction (θ2), take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4714)\n\nθ2 ≈ 28.1 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 28.1 degrees."
