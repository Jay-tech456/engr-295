    "message_1": "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction in which 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water vapor at a temperature of 298 K. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of water at the same temperature is -237.2 kJ/mol, and that of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas is 0 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g)\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) is 0 kJ/mol, and for water vapor (H₂O) is -237.2 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = [2 × ΔGf°(H₂O)] - [2 × ΔGf°(H₂) + ΔGf°(O₂)]\n\nΔG = [2 × (-237.2 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (0 kJ/mol) + (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔG = (-474.4 kJ) - (0 kJ)\n\nΔG = -474.4 kJ\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is -474.4 kJ."
