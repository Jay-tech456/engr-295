    "message_2": "The fine structure constant, denoted as α (alpha), is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. Its experimentally measured value is approximately 1/137.035999, or 7.2973525693 × 10^-3.\n\nThe theoretical prediction of the fine structure constant is not straightforward, as it is an empirical parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is determined from experimental measurements rather than derived from first principles. However, the value of α can be calculated using quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is a part of the Standard Model. The QED calculations involve higher-order corrections and are in good agreement with the experimental value.\n\nThe small deviation between the experimental and theoretical values of the fine structure constant could potentially be explained by physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the current level of agreement between the two values is considered to be quite good, and there is no strong evidence to suggest that the deviation is due to new physics. It is important to continue refining both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations to further test the consistency of the Standard Model and search for potential new physics."
