    "message_2": "The index of refraction (n) of a material is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the material (v). Mathematically, it is represented as:\n\nn = c/v\n\nWhen an object moves at relativistic velocities, its effective mass increases, and the speed of light in the material may be affected. To maintain transparency, the speed of light in the material should not fall below the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the Lorentz factor (γ), which accounts for relativistic effects.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nTo maintain transparency, we need:\n\nv_material ≥ c/γ\n\nSince n = c/v_material, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\nn ≤ γ\n\nThe maximum index of refraction that a material can have while maintaining transparency under the influence of relativistic velocities is equal to the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given velocity. Note that this is a simplified analysis and more complex factors may come into play in real-world scenarios."
