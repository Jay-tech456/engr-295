    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength shift after Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the wavelength shift, λ is the initial wavelength, λ' is the final wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven the initial wavelength λ = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^(-9) m and the scattering angle θ = 30 degrees, we can calculate the wavelength shift.\n\nFirst, convert the scattering angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, plug in the values into the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/6))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2.7327 x 10^(-22) Js) * (1 - cos(π/6))\nΔλ = 0.2424 * (1 - cos(π/6))\nΔλ ≈ 0.2424 * (1 - 0.866)\nΔλ ≈ 0.2424 * 0.134\n\nΔλ ≈ 0.0325 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength shift of the photon after undergoing Compton scattering with an electron in a sodium atom is approximately 0.0325 nanometers."
