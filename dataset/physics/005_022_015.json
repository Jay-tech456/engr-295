    "message_2": "In relativistic electromagnetism, the force experienced by a charged particle moving through a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF = q(E + v × B)\n\nwhere F is the force experienced by the particle, q is the charge of the particle, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nSince the particle is moving at a velocity close to the speed of light, we need to consider the relativistic effects. The relativistic velocity is given by:\n\nv' = v / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v' is the relativistic velocity, v is the classical velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Lorentz force equation in terms of the relativistic velocity:\n\nF = q(E + v' × B)\n\nTo find the magnitude of the force, we can take the cross product of v' and B:\n\n|F| = q * |v' × B|\n\nThe direction of the force can be found using the right-hand rule for cross products. If you point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of v' and curl them towards the direction of B, your thumb will point in the direction of the force.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the force experienced by the charged particle moving through a magnetic field with a velocity close to the speed of light is given by:\n\n|F| = q * |v' × B|\n\nAnd the direction of the force can be found using the right-hand rule for cross products."
