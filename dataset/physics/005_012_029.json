    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the spaceship (0.8c).\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / √(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\nK = (1.6667 - 1)(2000 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nK ≈ 0.6667 × 2000 kg × (9 × 10^16 m²/s²)\nK ≈ 1.3334 × 10^3 kg × 9 × 10^16 m²/s²\nK ≈ 1.20006 × 10^20 J\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.20006 × 10^20 Joules."
