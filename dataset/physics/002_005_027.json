    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 0.5 moles\nV1 = 1.0 L = 0.001 m³ (since 1 L = 0.001 m³)\nV2 = 3.0 L = 0.003 m³\nR = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔS = (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹) * ln(0.003 m³ / 0.001 m³)\n\nΔS = (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹) * ln(3)\n\nΔS ≈ (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹) * 1.099\n\nΔS ≈ 4.57 J K⁻¹\n\nSo, the entropy change when 0.5 moles of an ideal gas undergoes an isothermal expansion at a constant temperature of 300K from a volume of 1.0 L to 3.0 L is approximately 4.57 J K⁻¹."
