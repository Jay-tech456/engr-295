    "message_2": "In the context of relativistic quantum mechanics, we can use the energy-momentum relation to find the energy of an electron with a given momentum. The energy-momentum relation is given by:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere E is the energy, p is the momentum, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10^-31 kg).\n\nGiven the momentum p = 2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s, we can plug in the values and solve for E:\n\nE² = ((2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s))² + ((9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)²)²\n\nE² = (7.5 x 10^-15 kg m²/s²)² + (8.19 x 10^-14 kg m²/s²)²\n\nE² ≈ 6.5625 x 10^-29 kg² m⁴/s⁴ + 6.7104 x 10^-27 kg² m⁴/s⁴\n\nE² ≈ 6.7104 x 10^-27 kg² m⁴/s⁴ (since the first term is much smaller than the second term)\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find E:\n\nE ≈ √(6.7104 x 10^-27 kg² m⁴/s⁴)\n\nE ≈ 8.19 x 10^-14 kg m²/s²\n\nE ≈ 8.19 x 10^-14 J (joules)\n\nSo, the energy of the electron with a momentum of 2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s in a relativistic quantum mechanics context is approximately 8.19 x 10^-14 J."
