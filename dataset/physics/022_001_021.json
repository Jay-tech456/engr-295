    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Several candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, and their properties can be deduced from astrophysical observations and particle physics experiments. Some of the main candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are hypothetical particles that interact with other particles through the weak nuclear force and gravity. WIMPs are expected to have a mass ranging from a few GeV to a few TeV. Their properties can be deduced from direct detection experiments, where they could scatter off atomic nuclei, and indirect detection experiments, where they could annihilate or decay into standard model particles.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are very light, with a mass in the range of micro-electron volts (ÂµeV) to milli-electron volts (meV). Axions can be detected through their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field, as in the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX).\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through the weak nuclear force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They could have a mass in the keV range and could be detected through their decay into active neutrinos and photons, which could be observed as an X-ray signal in astrophysical observations.\n\n4. Primordial Black Holes: Primordial black holes are another candidate for dark matter. They are black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. Their properties can be deduced from gravitational lensing observations and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\n5. Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM): This is a class of dark matter models where dark matter particles can interact with each other through a new force, in addition to gravity. These models can be tested through their effects on the distribution and dynamics of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nTo deduce the properties of these dark matter candidates, scientists rely on a combination of astrophysical observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, as well as particle physics experiments, like direct and indirect detection experiments and collider searches. By comparing the experimental and observational data with theoretical predictions, researchers can constrain the properties of dark matter candidates and potentially discover the true nature of dark matter."
