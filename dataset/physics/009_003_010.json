    "message_2": "To determine the angle of incidence on the other face for which the ray would undergo total internal reflection at the second face, we first need to find the angle of refraction at the first face using Snell's Law.\n\nSnell's Law: n1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(i2)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and i1 and i2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of the prism), and i1 = 60 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(i2)\nsin(i2) = sin(60) / 1.5\ni2 ≈ 24.1 degrees\n\nNow, let's find the angle of the prism (A) using the formula:\n\nA = i1 + i2 - 90\nA = 60 + 24.1 - 90\nA ≈ -5.9 degrees\n\nSince the angle of the prism is negative, it means that the ray is deviated towards the base of the prism. To find the angle of incidence on the other face (i3), we can use the formula:\n\ni3 = 90 - A - i2\ni3 = 90 - (-5.9) - 24.1\ni3 ≈ 71.8 degrees\n\nNow, for total internal reflection to occur at the second face, the angle of refraction (i4) should be greater than the critical angle (C). The critical angle can be found using the formula:\n\nsin(C) = n2 / n1\nsin(C) = 1.5 / 1\nC ≈ 48.6 degrees\n\nSince i3 > C, total internal reflection will occur at the second face. Therefore, the angle of incidence on the other face for which the ray would undergo total internal reflection at the second face is approximately 71.8 degrees."
