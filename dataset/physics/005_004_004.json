    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass, kinetic energy, and momentum of the spaceship, we'll use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic mass (m_r) = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n2. Kinetic energy (K) = (m_r - m_0) * c^2\n3. Relativistic momentum (p) = m_r * v\n\nGiven:\nm_0 = 10,000 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic mass (m_r):\n\nm_r = 10,000 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nm_r = 10,000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm_r = 10,000 kg / sqrt(0.36)\nm_r ≈ 10,000 kg / 0.6\nm_r ≈ 16,666.67 kg\n\nNow, let's find the kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (16,666.67 kg - 10,000 kg) * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 6,666.67 kg * (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 5.999 * 10^20 Joules\n\nFinally, let's find the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = 16,666.67 kg * 0.8c\np ≈ 13,333.33 kg * 2.4 * 10^8 m/s\np ≈ 3.2 * 10^12 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 16,666.67 kg, the kinetic energy is approximately 5.999 * 10^20 Joules, and the relativistic momentum is approximately 3.2 * 10^12 kg m/s."
