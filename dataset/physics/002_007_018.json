    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity (C) of the copper disk, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in Joules), m is the mass (in kg), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/kg·°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given:\nQ = 1,000 J\nm = 500 g (which needs to be converted to kg)\nΔT = 10 °C\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass from grams to kilograms:\nm = 500 g * (1 kg / 1,000 g) = 0.5 kg\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 1,000 J / (0.5 kg * 10 °C) = 1,000 J / 5 kg·°C = 200 J/kg·°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the copper disk is 200 J/kg·°C."
