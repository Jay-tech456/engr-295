    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. For a concave mirror, the focal length is half of the radius of curvature:\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n2/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nThe image distance is 15 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -15 cm / 30 cm = -0.5\n\nThe magnification is -0.5, which means the image is half the size of the object.\n\nSince the magnification is negative, the image is inverted. The image is also real because it is formed on the same side of the mirror as the object. In summary, the image is real, inverted, and half the size of the object."
