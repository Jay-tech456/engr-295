    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the axis of the helix, we can use Ampere's Law and Biot-Savart Law. However, since the helix can be approximated as a solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per meter, and I is the current.\n\nGiven:\nn = 10 turns/meter\nI = 2 A\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (10 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB = 8π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the axis. Since the radius of the helix is 4 cm, the point is located outside the solenoid. The magnetic field outside a solenoid is approximately zero. However, if we want to calculate the magnetic field at this point more accurately, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven:\nR = 4 cm = 0.04 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2 A) * (0.04 m)² / (2 * (0.04 m² + 0.05 m²)^(3/2))\nB ≈ 1.34 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the axis of the helix is approximately 1.34 × 10⁻⁶ T."
