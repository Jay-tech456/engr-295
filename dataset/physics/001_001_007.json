    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass m confined to a square potential well with sides of length L, we first need to define the potential energy function V(x). The potential energy is zero inside the well (0 < x < L) and infinite outside the well.\n\nV(x) = { 0 for 0 < x < L\n       { ∞ for x ≤ 0 or x ≥ L\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional system is given by:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nInside the well (0 < x < L), V(x) = 0, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = E * ψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k² = 2mE / ħ².\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. Since the potential is infinite outside the well, the wave function must be zero at x = 0 and x = L:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince B = 0, the wave function simplifies to:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nThe condition ψ(L) = 0 implies that sin(kL) = 0. This is satisfied when kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, the allowed wave numbers are:\n\nk_n = nπ / L, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe corresponding allowed energy states are:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * k_n²) / 2m = (ħ² * n² * π²) / (2m * L²), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nTo find the normalization constant A, we use the normalization condition:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n∫ (A * sin(k_n x))² dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nA² * ∫ sin²(k_n x) dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nA² * (L / 2) = 1\n\nA = sqrt(2 / L)\n\nSo, the normalized wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(k_n x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(nπx / L), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nIn summary, the allowed energy states for a particle of mass m confined to a square potential well with sides of length L are:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * n² * π²) / (2m * L²), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nAnd the corresponding wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(nπx / L), for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
