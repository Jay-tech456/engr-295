    "message_1": "A 400-turn coil is wound on a rectangular iron core. The core has a cross-sectional area of 0.04mÂ² and a mean length of 0.5m. When a current of 5A flows through the coil, what is the magnetic field strength inside the core?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength inside the core, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field strength (H) is equal to the number of turns (N) multiplied by the current (I) divided by the length of the core (l). \n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\nH = (N * I) / l\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nN = 400 turns\nI = 5 A\nl = 0.5 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nH = (400 * 5) / 0.5\n\nH = 2000 / 0.5\n\nH = 4000 A/m\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength inside the core is 4000 A/m."
