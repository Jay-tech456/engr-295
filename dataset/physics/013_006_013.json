    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation:\n\nE = (Δm)c^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy released, Δm is the change in mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in mass (Δm) during the supernova explosion. The initial mass is 25 solar masses, and the remnant mass is 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, the change in mass is:\n\nΔm = 25 - 1.4 = 23.6 solar masses\n\nNow, we need to convert solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the change in mass in kg is:\n\nΔm = 23.6 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) ≈ 4.69 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need the speed of light in meters per second (m/s). The speed of light, c, is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nE = (4.69 x 10^31 kg)(3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nE ≈ 4.69 x 10^31 kg * 9.00 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nE ≈ 4.221 x 10^48 kg m^2/s^2\n\nE ≈ 4.221 x 10^48 Joules\n\nSo, the total energy released in the supernova explosion is approximately 4.221 x 10^48 Joules."
