    "message_2": "The energy released during the process of nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun is primarily due to the conversion of hydrogen into helium. This process is called the proton-proton chain, and it occurs in several steps.\n\nIn the Sun, about 3.8 x 10^26 joules of energy are released per second as a result of nuclear fusion. This is equivalent to 3.8 x 10^33 ergs per second or 9.1 x 10^10 megatons of TNT per second.\n\nTo calculate the total energy released over a specific period, you can multiply the energy released per second by the number of seconds in that period. For example, to find the energy released in one day, you would multiply 3.8 x 10^26 joules/second by the number of seconds in a day (86,400 seconds):\n\n3.8 x 10^26 J/s * 86,400 s = 3.28 x 10^31 J\n\nSo, approximately 3.28 x 10^31 joules of energy are released during the process of nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun in one day."
