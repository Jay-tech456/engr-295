    "message_2": "To calculate the change in frequency due to the relativistic Doppler effect, we can use the following formula:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_source is the source frequency, v is the velocity of the observer relative to the source, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency of the source (f_source) using the given wavelength (500 nm):\n\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\nwavelength = 500 nm = 500 * 10^-9 m\n\nf_source = c / wavelength\nf_source = (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (500 * 10^-9 m)\nf_source ≈ 6 * 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the observed frequency (f_observed) using the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nv = 0.5c\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\nf_observed = (6 * 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.5) / (1 - 0.5))\nf_observed ≈ (6 * 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(1.5 / 0.5)\nf_observed ≈ (6 * 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(3)\nf_observed ≈ 10.3923 * 10^14 Hz\n\nThe change in frequency is the difference between the observed frequency and the source frequency:\n\nΔf = f_observed - f_source\nΔf ≈ (10.3923 * 10^14 Hz) - (6 * 10^14 Hz)\nΔf ≈ 4.3923 * 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the change in frequency is approximately 4.3923 * 10^14 Hz."
