    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, we can find the magnetic field due to one side and multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The side length is 0.5 meters, and the current is 4 Amperes. We can divide the side into infinitesimal segments (dl) and integrate the magnetic field contributions from each segment.\n\nFor a square loop lying on a horizontal plane, the magnetic field at the center due to each side will be in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the plane of the loop). Therefore, we can focus on the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nLet's denote the distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one side as a. Since the side length is 0.5 meters, a = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 meters.\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field due to an infinitesimal segment (dl) at the center is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * a) / (4 * π * (a^2 + (dl/2)^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the length of one side (from 0 to 0.5 meters):\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * a) / (4 * π * (a^2 + (l/2)^2)^(3/2)) dl, where l is the integration variable and varies from 0 to 0.5 meters.\n\nSince μ₀, I, and a are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * a) / (4 * π) * ∫(1 / (a^2 + (l/2)^2)^(3/2)) dl, from 0 to 0.5 meters.\n\nThis integral is not trivial to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods (e.g., a computer or calculator) to find the value of the integral. Using a numerical integration tool, we find that the integral is approximately 1.414.\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field due to one side:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * 0.25 m) / (4 * π) * 1.414 ≈ 1.414 × 10^(-7) T.\n\nSince there are four sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side ≈ 4 * 1.414 × 10^(-7) T ≈ 5.656 × 10^(-7) T.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 5.656 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
