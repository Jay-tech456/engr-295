(Assuming the planet's gravitational field causes a redshift of 1.5×10^-16)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in frequency due to the gravitational redshift, we can use the formula:\n\nΔf/f = gh/c²\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, g is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²), h is the height difference between the clock on the surface and the clock in space, and c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven the redshift value of 1.5 × 10^-16, we can write:\n\n1.5 × 10^-16 = (9.8 m/s² × h) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)²\n\nNow, we need to solve for h:\n\nh = (1.5 × 10^-16 × (3 × 10^8 m/s)²) / (9.8 m/s²)\nh ≈ 4.59 × 10^-9 m\n\nNow that we have the height difference, we can calculate the change in frequency (Δf) using the initial frequency (f) and the redshift value:\n\nΔf = f × 1.5 × 10^-16\n\nSince we don't know the initial frequency of the light beams emitted by the clock, we can't provide an exact value for the change in frequency. However, we can say that the change in frequency (Δf) is equal to the initial frequency (f) multiplied by the redshift value (1.5 × 10^-16)."
