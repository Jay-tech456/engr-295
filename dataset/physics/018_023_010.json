    "message_2": "Improving the precision of measuring the strong interaction coupling constant (αs) in high energy physics experiments can be achieved through various approaches. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Increase experimental data: Collect more experimental data from high-energy physics experiments, such as those conducted at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This will help reduce statistical uncertainties and improve the precision of αs measurements.\n\n2. Improve theoretical calculations: Enhance the accuracy of theoretical calculations for processes involving the strong interaction. This can be done by incorporating higher-order perturbative QCD corrections, resummation techniques, and non-perturbative effects. Improved theoretical predictions will lead to more precise extractions of αs from experimental data.\n\n3. Lattice QCD simulations: Improve lattice QCD simulations, which provide a non-perturbative method to calculate various quantities related to the strong interaction, including αs. Advances in computational power and algorithms can lead to more accurate lattice QCD results, which can be used to cross-check and constrain αs measurements from experiments.\n\n4. Global analyses: Perform global analyses that combine data from various experiments and processes to extract αs. This approach can help reduce systematic uncertainties and improve the overall precision of αs measurements. Examples of global analyses include the determination of αs from event shapes, jet production, and heavy quarkonia decays.\n\n5. New experimental techniques: Develop and implement new experimental techniques to measure αs more precisely. This could involve novel detector technologies, improved event reconstruction algorithms, or new observables that are sensitive to αs.\n\n6. Explore new energy regimes: Investigate the strong interaction in new energy regimes, such as those accessible at future high-energy colliders like the High-Luminosity LHC or the proposed Future Circular Collider. These experiments can provide additional constraints on αs and help improve its precision.\n\n7. Interdisciplinary collaboration: Encourage collaboration between experimentalists, theorists, and computational physicists to address the challenges in measuring αs more precisely. This can lead to the development of new methods, improved understanding of systematic uncertainties, and better interpretation of experimental results.\n\nBy pursuing these approaches, the precision of measuring the strong interaction coupling constant (αs) in high energy physics experiments can be significantly improved, leading to a deeper understanding of the strong force and its role in the fundamental interactions of nature."
