    "message_1": "What is the frequency of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two neutron stars with masses of 1.4 and 1.7 solar masses respectively, located 130 million light-years away from Earth, assuming that the resulting remnant has a mass of 2.8 solar masses?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two neutron stars, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase of a binary system:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the merger.\n\nHowever, we need to find the time until the merger (t) first. We can use the chirp mass formula to do this:\n\nMc = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere Mc is the chirp mass, and m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. In this case, m1 = 1.4 solar masses and m2 = 1.7 solar masses. \n\nMc = (1.4 * 1.7)^(3/5) / (1.4 + 1.7)^(1/5)\nMc ≈ 1.22 solar masses\n\nNow we can use the chirp mass to find the time until the merger:\n\nt = (5/256 * c^5 / (G^3 * Mc * (m1 + m2)))^(8/3)\n\nt ≈ (5/256 * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^5 / (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^3 * 1.22 * (1.4 + 1.7) * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^(8/3)\nt ≈ 1.56 * 10^10 s\n\nNow we can plug this value of t back into the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\nf ≈ ((3 * 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5/256 * 1.56 * 10^10 s))^(-3/8)\nf ≈ 155 Hz\n\nSo the frequency of gravitational waves produced by the merger of these two neutron stars is approximately 155 Hz."
