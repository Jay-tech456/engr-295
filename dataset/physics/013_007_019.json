    "message_2": "To determine the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we need to know its rotational speed. Unfortunately, the rotational speed of the galactic halo is not well-defined, as it does not rotate like a solid disk. The stars and other objects in the halo have a wide range of velocities and orbits, making it difficult to assign a single rotational speed to the entire halo.\n\nHowever, we can attempt to estimate the rotational period using the rotational speed of the Milky Way's disk, which is better understood. The Sun, located in the Milky Way's disk, orbits the galactic center at a speed of approximately 220 km/s. Assuming that the halo has a similar rotational speed, we can use this value to estimate the rotational period.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the radius of the halo from light-years to kilometers:\n\n1 light-year ≈ 9.461 × 10^12 km\n\n65,000 light-years ≈ 65,000 × 9.461 × 10^12 km ≈ 6.15 × 10^17 km\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the distance the halo would travel in one rotation:\n\nC = 2πr ≈ 2 × 3.1416 × 6.15 × 10^17 km ≈ 3.87 × 10^18 km\n\nNow, we can divide the circumference by the rotational speed to find the time it takes for one rotation:\n\nT = C / v ≈ (3.87 × 10^18 km) / (220 km/s) ≈ 1.76 × 10^16 s\n\nFinally, we can convert this time to years:\n\n1 year ≈ 3.154 × 10^7 s\n\nT ≈ 1.76 × 10^16 s / 3.154 × 10^7 s/year ≈ 5.58 × 10^8 years\n\nSo, the estimated rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, assuming a similar rotational speed as the disk, is approximately 558 million years. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and may not accurately represent the complex motions within the galactic halo."
