    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point above the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can break it down into four straight segments and find the magnetic field due to each segment. Then, we can sum up the contributions from all four segments to find the total magnetic field at the point above the center of the loop.\n\nLet's consider the four segments of the rectangular loop:\n\n1. Top segment: 25 cm long, parallel to the x-axis\n2. Bottom segment: 25 cm long, parallel to the x-axis\n3. Left segment: 15 cm long, parallel to the y-axis\n4. Right segment: 15 cm long, parallel to the y-axis\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the magnetic field contributions will cancel each other out due to symmetry. Therefore, we only need to consider the magnetic field contributions from the left and right segments.\n\nLet's find the magnetic field due to the left segment:\n\nThe position vector r for the left segment is given by:\n\nr = <0, 7.5, 10> cm\n\nThe differential length vector dl for the left segment is given by:\n\ndl = <0, dy, 0>\n\nThe cross product dl x r is given by:\n\ndl x r = <-10 dy, 0, 0>\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the length of the left segment:\n\nB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³ dy from 0 to 15 cm\n\nB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(-10 I dy) / (7.5² + 10²)^(3/2) dy from 0 to 15 cm\n\nSimilarly, we can find the magnetic field due to the right segment:\n\nThe position vector r for the right segment is given by:\n\nr = <25, 7.5, 10> cm\n\nThe differential length vector dl for the right segment is given by:\n\ndl = <0, dy, 0>\n\nThe cross product dl x r is given by:\n\ndl x r = <10 dy, 0, 0>\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the length of the right segment:\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³ dy from 0 to 15 cm\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(10 I dy) / (25² + 7.5² + 10²)^(3/2) dy from 0 to 15 cm\n\nThe total magnetic field at the point above the center of the loop is the sum of the magnetic fields due to the left and right segments:\n\nB_total = B_left + B_right\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve the integrals:\n\nB_total = (5 * 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (∫(-10 dy) / (7.5² + 10²)^(3/2) dy from 0 to 15 cm + ∫(10 dy) / (25² + 7.5² + 10²)^(3/2) dy from 0 to 15 cm)\n\nB_total ≈ 1.16 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the negative x-axis, as the contributions from the left and right segments are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 10 cm above the center of the loop is approximately 1.16 × 10^(-6) T, and the direction is along the negative x-axis."
