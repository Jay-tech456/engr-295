    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -20 cm (negative because it's a concave lens)\ndo = 40 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/40 + 1/di\n\nMultiplying both sides by -40di, we get:\n\n-2di = -di + 40\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ndi = 40 cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = -di/do\n\nm = -40/40\n\nm = -1\n\nThe magnification is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted. The image is formed at a distance of 40 cm from the lens on the same side as the object."
