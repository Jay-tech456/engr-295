    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (focal length)\nu = -30 cm (object distance, negative since it's on the same side as the incoming light)\n\nWe can now plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/30\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 60\n1/v = 5/60\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 12 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (M) of the image. The magnification formula is:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -12 / (-30)\nM = 12/30\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification of the image is 2/5 or 0.4. This means the image is smaller than the object, specifically 0.4 times the size of the object."
