    "message_2": "The probability that ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) detected on Earth originate from a black hole is not straightforward to determine. It depends on various factors, such as the distribution of black holes in the universe, their energy emission mechanisms, and the propagation of cosmic rays through intergalactic and interstellar space. However, I can provide some insights into the topic.\n\nUHECRs are extremely energetic particles, with energies exceeding 10^18 eV. Their origin is still a subject of ongoing research, and several astrophysical sources have been proposed, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and black holes.\n\nBlack holes can potentially accelerate particles to ultra-high energies through different mechanisms, such as the Blandford-Znajek process, which involves the extraction of energy from the black hole's rotation, or the Penrose process, which relies on the ergosphere of a rotating black hole. However, these mechanisms are not exclusive to black holes and can also occur in other astrophysical objects.\n\nTo estimate the probability that UHECRs detected on Earth originate from a black hole, one would need to compare the contribution of black holes to the overall production of UHECRs with that of other potential sources. This is a complex task that requires detailed modeling and observational data, which are still limited.\n\nRegarding the expected energy spectrum of cosmic rays emitted by a black hole, it would depend on the specific acceleration mechanism and the properties of the black hole (e.g., mass, spin). In general, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays emitted by astrophysical sources is expected to follow a power-law distribution, with a spectral index that depends on the acceleration process. For black holes, the exact shape of the energy spectrum is still a subject of theoretical investigation and might vary depending on the specific scenario considered.\n\nIn summary, the probability that UHECRs detected on Earth originate from a black hole is not easy to determine and depends on various factors. The energy spectrum of cosmic rays emitted by a black hole would depend on the specific acceleration mechanism and the black hole's properties. Further observational data and theoretical studies are needed to better understand the role of black holes in the production of UHECRs."
