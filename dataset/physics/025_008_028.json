    "message_2": "To find the force generated by a muscle during contraction, we can use the formula:\n\nForce (F) = Maximum tensile stress (σ) × Cross-sectional area (A)\n\nGiven the maximum tensile stress (σ) is 30 N/cm² and the cross-sectional area (A) is 10 cm², we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nF = σ × A\nF = 30 N/cm² × 10 cm²\n\nF = 300 N\n\nTherefore, the force generated by the muscle during contraction is 300 Newtons."
