    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to an infinitesimal length element dl carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length element, and r is the distance from the conductor to the point P.\n\nSince the conductor is straight, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the conductor to find the total magnetic field B at the point P:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4π * r^3)\n\nLet's consider the geometry of the problem. The conductor is straight and has a length of 20 cm (0.2 m). The point P is at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the conductor. We can set up a coordinate system with the origin at one end of the conductor and the x-axis along the length of the conductor. The point P is at a position (x, y) = (0.1 m, 0.05 m).\n\nNow, let's integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the conductor:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4π * r^3) from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m\n\nSince the conductor is straight, dl = dx and r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The cross product dl x r is equal to dl * r * sin(θ), where θ is the angle between dl and r. In this case, θ = 90°, so sin(θ) = 1.\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dx * sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) / (4π * (x^2 + y^2)^(3/2)) from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for I, μ₀, and y:\n\nB = ∫(4π * 10^-7 Tm/A * 2 A * dx * sqrt(x^2 + (0.05 m)^2)) / (4π * (x^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2)) from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m\n\nThe 4π terms cancel out:\n\nB = ∫(2 * 10^-7 Tm * dx * sqrt(x^2 + 0.0025 m^2)) / (x^2 + 0.0025 m^2)^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nB = 2 * 10^-7 Tm * ∫(dx * sqrt(x^2 + 0.0025 m^2)) / (x^2 + 0.0025 m^2)^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 0.2 m\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution: let u = x^2 + 0.0025 m^2, so du = 2x dx. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * ∫(du * sqrt(u)) / u^(3/2) from u = 0.0025 m^2 to u = 0.0425 m^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * ∫(du / sqrt(u)) from u = 0.0025 m^2 to u = 0.0425 m^2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * [2 * sqrt(u)] from u = 0.0025 m^2 to u = 0.0425 m^2\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * (2 * sqrt(0.0425 m^2) - 2 * sqrt(0.0025 m^2))\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * (2 * 0.2062 m - 2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = 10^-7 Tm * (0.3124 m)\n\nB = 3.124 x 10^-8 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the conductor is approximately 3.124 x 10^-8 T."
