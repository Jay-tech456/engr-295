    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 4 cm away from the center of the inductor's coil, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid (assuming the inductor is a solenoid). The formula is:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate the magnetic field. We need to know the number of turns per unit length (n) and the length of the inductor. \n\nIf you can provide the number of turns and the length of the inductor, we can proceed with the calculation."
