    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at a velocity of 0.6c passes by Earth. An astronaut on the spaceship measures its length to be 80 meters. How long is the spaceship according to an observer on Earth? (Assume the spaceship is oriented perpendicular to the direction of its motion.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the object as measured by the observer, L0 is the proper length of the object (the length measured by the astronaut on the spaceship), v is the relative velocity of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, L0 = 80 meters, v = 0.6c, and c is the speed of light.\n\nL = 80 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nL = 80 * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nL = 80 * sqrt(0.64)\n\nL = 80 * 0.8\nL = 64 meters\n\nSo, according to an observer on Earth, the length of the spaceship is 64 meters."
