    "message_2": "The maximum mass limit that a neutron star can have before collapsing into a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is approximately 2 to 3 times the mass of the Sun (2-3 solar masses). However, the exact value depends on the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron star, which describes the relationship between its pressure, density, and temperature. The EOS is still not fully understood, and therefore the precise value of the TOV limit remains uncertain.\n\nThe mass limit of a neutron star is influenced by its properties, such as its radius and rotation rate:\n\n1. Radius: The radius of a neutron star is related to its mass and density. A smaller radius implies a higher density, which in turn affects the EOS. If the radius is too small, the neutron star will be more prone to collapse under its own gravity, leading to a lower mass limit. Conversely, a larger radius corresponds to a lower density and a potentially higher mass limit.\n\n2. Rotation rate: Rapidly rotating neutron stars, known as millisecond pulsars, can support a higher mass limit due to the centrifugal force generated by their rotation. This force counteracts the gravitational force, allowing the neutron star to maintain stability at higher masses. However, there is a limit to how fast a neutron star can rotate before it becomes unstable and breaks apart. This critical rotation rate depends on the neutron star's mass, radius, and EOS.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass limit of a neutron star before collapsing into a black hole depends on its equation of state, radius, and rotation rate. The TOV limit provides an approximate range of 2-3 solar masses, but the exact value remains uncertain due to our incomplete understanding of the EOS."
