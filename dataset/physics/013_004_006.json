    "message_2": "Dark matter, a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. Its presence has been inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. One of the key observational phenomena that supports the existence of dark matter is gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy or a quasar. This bending of light is due to the gravitational influence of the massive object, which causes the spacetime around it to curve, in accordance with Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. The result is that the background object appears distorted, magnified, or even multiply-imaged, depending on the mass distribution of the lensing object and the alignment between the observer, the lens, and the background source.\n\nThe presence of dark matter affects gravitational lensing in several ways:\n\n1. Enhanced lensing effect: Dark matter contributes to the overall mass of the lensing object, such as a galaxy or a galaxy cluster. Since the strength of the lensing effect is proportional to the mass of the lensing object, the presence of dark matter enhances the lensing effect, causing more significant distortions and magnifications of the background sources.\n\n2. Mass distribution: Dark matter is believed to form massive halos around galaxies and galaxy clusters, providing a more extended mass distribution than the visible matter alone. This extended mass distribution can lead to more complex lensing patterns, such as the formation of giant arcs or Einstein rings around massive galaxy clusters.\n\nObservational evidence supporting the influence of dark matter on gravitational lensing includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars and gas in spiral galaxies reveal that they do not decrease with distance from the galactic center, as would be expected if only visible matter were present. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, which contributes to the gravitational lensing effect.\n\n2. Cluster mass estimates: The total mass of galaxy clusters, as inferred from gravitational lensing measurements, is significantly higher than the mass of the visible matter alone (stars, gas, and dust). This excess mass can be attributed to the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains tiny temperature fluctuations that reveal information about the early universe's composition. Observations of the CMB, such as those made by the Planck satellite, indicate that dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe, which in turn affects the distribution of mass and the resulting gravitational lensing effects.\n\n4. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. Observations of the cluster show that the majority of the mass, as determined by gravitational lensing, is spatially separated from the hot gas, which is the primary component of visible matter in galaxy clusters. This separation indicates that dark matter is present and contributes significantly to the overall mass and lensing effect.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter affects gravitational lensing by enhancing the lensing effect and altering the mass distribution of lensing objects. Observational evidence, such as galaxy rotation curves, cluster mass estimates, CMB observations, and the Bullet Cluster, supports the theory that dark matter plays a significant role in gravitational lensing phenomena."
