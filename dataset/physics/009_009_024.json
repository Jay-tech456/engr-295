    "message_2": "To find the position, nature, and magnification of the image formed by a concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the mirror\nu = distance of the object from the mirror (negative for a real object)\nv = distance of the image from the mirror (positive for a real image, negative for a virtual image)\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature (R) is related to the focal length (f) by:\nf = R/2\n\nIn this case, R = 20 cm, so the focal length is:\nf = 20/2 = 10 cm\n\nSince the mirror is concave, the focal length is negative:\nf = -10 cm\n\nThe object distance (u) is given as 30 cm, and since the object is real, it is negative:\nu = -30 cm\n\nNow we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-10) = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n1/v = 1/(-10) - 1/(-30)\n1/v = (-2 + 1)/30\n1/v = -1/30\n\nSo, v = -30 cm\n\nSince the image distance (v) is negative, the image is virtual and erect.\n\nNow let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nSubstituting the values of v and u, we get:\nM = -(-30)/(-30)\nM = 1\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is virtual, erect, and the same size as the object. The image is located 30 cm behind the mirror."
