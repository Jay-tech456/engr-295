    "message_2": "Topological insulators are a unique class of materials that exhibit insulating behavior in their bulk but have conducting surface states. The mechanism that protects the current in topological insulators is based on their topological properties, which are related to the electronic band structure of the material.\n\nIn a topological insulator, the bulk bandgap prevents the flow of current through the material, while the surface states allow for the conduction of current. These surface states are protected by time-reversal symmetry, which means that the electronic states remain unchanged under time-reversal transformation. This symmetry prevents backscattering of electrons, allowing them to flow without dissipation and making the surface states robust against impurities and defects.\n\nThe key difference between topological insulators and normal insulators lies in the presence of these protected surface states. In a normal insulator, there are no conducting states at the surface or edges, and the material is insulating throughout its entire volume. In contrast, topological insulators have conducting surface states that are protected by their topological nature, leading to unique electronic properties that are not found in ordinary insulators.\n\nIn summary, the mechanism of protecting the current in topological insulators is based on their topological properties and time-reversal symmetry, which give rise to robust, dissipationless surface states. This sets them apart from normal insulators, which do not have such protected conducting states."
