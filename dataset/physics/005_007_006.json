    "message_1": "A pair of twins, Alice and Bob, are born on Earth. At the age of 25, Alice leaves Earth on a spaceship traveling at 0.6c to a star system 12 light-years away. Upon arrival, Alice immediately turns around and travels back to Earth at the same speed. When Alice returns to Earth, she finds that Bob has aged by 40 years. How much time has passed for Alice during her trip?",
    "message_2": "To determine how much time has passed for Alice during her trip, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The time dilation formula is:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the time experienced by the moving observer (Alice), t is the time experienced by the stationary observer (Bob), v is the relative velocity between the observers, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it takes for Alice to travel to the star system and back in Bob's frame of reference. Since the star system is 12 light-years away and Alice is traveling at 0.6c, the time it takes for her to travel one way is:\n\nt_one_way = distance / speed = 12 light-years / 0.6c = 20 years\n\nSince Alice immediately turns around and travels back to Earth at the same speed, the total time for the round trip in Bob's frame of reference is:\n\nt_total = 2 * t_one_way = 2 * 20 years = 40 years\n\nNow we can use the time dilation formula to find the time experienced by Alice during her trip:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 40 years / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\n\nt' = 40 years / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 40 years / sqrt(0.64) = 40 years / 0.8 = 50 years\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the initial 25 years before Alice left Earth to find out how much time has passed for her during the trip:\n\nt_Alice_trip = t' - 25 years = 50 years - 25 years = 25 years\n\nSo, 25 years have passed for Alice during her trip."
