    "message_2": "In a free scalar quantum field theory, we consider a scalar field φ(x) with the action:\n\nS[φ] = ∫d^4x (1/2 (∂μφ(x))^2 - 1/2 m^2 φ(x)^2)\n\nThe operator product expansion (OPE) is a formalism used to express the product of two local operators at different spacetime points as a sum of local operators at a single point, with coefficients that depend on the separation between the two points. In the case of a free scalar field theory, the OPE of two local operators can be written as:\n\nφ(x) φ(y) = ∑_i C_i(x-y) O_i(x)\n\nHere, the sum runs over a complete set of local operators O_i(x), and the coefficients C_i(x-y) depend on the separation between the two points x and y.\n\nIn a free scalar field theory, the most relevant operators are the identity operator I, the field φ itself, and its derivatives. The OPE can be written as:\n\nφ(x) φ(y) = C_0(x-y) I + C_1(x-y) φ(x) + C_2(x-y) ∂μφ(x) + ...\n\nTo determine the coefficients C_i(x-y), we can use the two-point correlation function:\n\n<φ(x) φ(y)> = ∫[Dφ] φ(x) φ(y) e^(-S[φ])\n\nFor a free scalar field theory, this correlation function is given by the propagator:\n\n<φ(x) φ(y)> = Δ(x-y) = ∫(d^4k/(2π)^4) (e^(ik·(x-y))/((k^2-m^2+iε)))\n\nNow, we can compare the two-point correlation function with the OPE:\n\n<φ(x) φ(y)> = <C_0(x-y) I + C_1(x-y) φ(x) + C_2(x-y) ∂μφ(x) + ...>\n\nSince the field φ(x) and its derivatives have vanishing vacuum expectation values, we have:\n\n<φ(x) φ(y)> = C_0(x-y)\n\nThus, we find that the coefficient C_0(x-y) is given by the propagator:\n\nC_0(x-y) = Δ(x-y)\n\nThe scaling dimensions of the resulting operator product can be determined by analyzing the behavior of the coefficients C_i(x-y) under a scale transformation x → λx, y → λy. For the propagator, we have:\n\nΔ(λ(x-y)) = ∫(d^4k/(2π)^4) (e^(ik·(λ(x-y)))/((k^2-m^2+iε)))\n\nMaking the change of variables k' = λk, we find:\n\nΔ(λ(x-y)) = (1/λ^4) ∫(d^4k'/(2π)^4) (e^(ik'·(x-y))/((k'^2/λ^2-m^2+iε)))\n\nThus, the propagator scales as Δ(λ(x-y)) ∼ 1/λ^4, which implies that the scaling dimension of the identity operator I is 4.\n\nFor the other operators in the OPE, we can similarly analyze their scaling dimensions by studying the behavior of their coefficients C_i(x-y) under scale transformations."
