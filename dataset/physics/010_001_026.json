    "message_1": "A water tower is 20 meters high and has a sphere-shaped tank on top with a diameter of 5 meters. Water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 0.1 cubic meters per second. If a pipe connected to the tank is opened, what is the speed of the water coming out of the pipe? (Assume negligible friction and air resistance.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the speed of the water coming out of the pipe, we can use Torricelli's theorem, which relates the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice to the height of the fluid above the orifice. The theorem states that:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * g * h)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the fluid above the orifice.\n\nIn this case, the height of the water tower is 20 meters, so:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 20)\nv ≈ sqrt(392.4)\nv ≈ 19.81 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the water coming out of the pipe is approximately 19.81 meters per second, assuming negligible friction and air resistance."
