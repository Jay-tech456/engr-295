    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of fusion, we can use the following formula:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in Joules), m is the mass of the substance (in kilograms), and L is the latent heat of fusion (in Joules per kilogram).\n\nWe are given the values of Q and m:\n\nQ = 60,000 Joules\nm = 2 kg\n\nNow, we need to solve for L:\n\nL = Q / m\n\nL = 60,000 J / 2 kg\n\nL = 30,000 J/kg\n\nSo, the latent heat of fusion of the substance is 30,000 Joules per kilogram."
