    "message_2": "To determine the detectability probability of gravitational waves emitted by a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) using current gravitational-wave observatories, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the population of IMBHs: First, we need to define the population of IMBHs we are interested in, including their mass range, formation mechanisms, and spatial distribution in the universe.\n\n2. Calculate the expected gravitational wave signals: For each IMBH binary system, we can calculate the expected gravitational wave signal using General Relativity. This involves determining the waveform, frequency, and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases of the binary coalescence.\n\n3. Determine the sensitivity of current gravitational-wave observatories: Next, we need to determine the sensitivity of current gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. This involves understanding the noise characteristics and frequency response of these detectors.\n\n4. Calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): For each IMBH binary system, we can calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by comparing the expected gravitational wave signal to the detector noise. The SNR depends on the distance to the source, the masses of the black holes, and the orientation of the binary system relative to the detector.\n\n5. Determine the detection threshold: Gravitational-wave observatories typically use a detection threshold based on the SNR to claim a detection. For example, a common threshold is an SNR of 8 or higher.\n\n6. Calculate the detectability probability: For each IMBH binary system, we can calculate the probability that the SNR will exceed the detection threshold. This can be done by integrating the SNR distribution over the parameter space of the IMBH population, taking into account the detector sensitivity and the astrophysical properties of the IMBHs.\n\n7. Estimate the detection rate: Finally, we can estimate the detection rate of IMBH gravitational waves by multiplying the detectability probability by the expected rate of IMBH binary coalescences in the universe. This will give us an estimate of how many IMBH gravitational wave events we can expect to detect with current observatories.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the detectability probability of gravitational waves emitted by a population of intermediate-mass black holes using current gravitational-wave observatories. This information can help guide the design of future detectors and inform our understanding of the properties and formation mechanisms of IMBHs."
