    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe mass of our sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nr_s = (2 x 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s â‰ˆ 2.954 x 10^3 meters\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass equal to that of our sun is approximately 2.954 kilometers.\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, including light. The size of the event horizon is directly related to the Schwarzschild radius. In this case, the event horizon would be a sphere with a radius of 2.954 kilometers."
