    "message_1": "Calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump that operates between 10°C and 30°C, and has a heat output of 10 kW while consuming 3 kW of electricity.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat output (Q_out) to the work input (W_in). In this case, the heat output is 10 kW, and the work input is 3 kW. So, the COP can be calculated as follows:\n\nCOP = Q_out / W_in\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nCOP = 10 kW / 3 kW\nCOP = 3.33\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 3.33. This means that for every 1 kW of electricity consumed, the heat pump transfers 3.33 kW of heat from the colder reservoir to the warmer one."
