    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the semicircle, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small segment of current-carrying wire is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, dl is the length of the small segment, θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the line connecting the segment to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and r is the distance from the segment to that point.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the semicircle. For any small segment of the wire, the angle θ is 90 degrees (since the current is tangent to the circle and the line connecting the segment to the center is a radius), so sinθ = 1. The distance r is equal to the radius R for all segments.\n\nIntegrating the Biot-Savart law around the semicircle, we have:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * R²)\n\nSince μ₀, I, and R are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * R²) * ∫dl\n\nNow we need to integrate dl around the semicircle. The total length of the semicircle is given by half the circumference of a full circle, which is (1/2) * 2πR = πR. So, the integral of dl is:\n\n∫dl = πR\n\nNow we can plug this back into our expression for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * R²) * πR\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * R)\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the semicircle due to the current passing through it is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * R)"
