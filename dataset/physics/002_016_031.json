    "message_1": "A physics student is given a container containing 1 mol of helium gas at 10 atm and 27°C. Assuming the gas behaves as an ideal gas, calculate the critical temperature of the substance.",
    "message_2": "The critical temperature of a substance is the temperature above which it cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied. It is a property of the substance itself and is not dependent on the initial conditions of the gas sample (such as pressure, volume, or temperature). Therefore, the given information about the helium gas sample is not relevant to finding the critical temperature.\n\nTo find the critical temperature of helium, we can use the following relation:\n\nTc = (8/27) * (a/R) * (1/b)\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature, a and b are the Van der Waals constants for helium, and R is the universal gas constant.\n\nFor helium, the Van der Waals constants are:\na = 0.0341 atm L²/mol²\nb = 0.0237 L/mol\n\nThe universal gas constant R is:\nR = 0.0821 L atm / (K mol)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nTc = (8/27) * (0.0341 / 0.0821) * (1/0.0237)\n\nTc ≈ 3.68 K\n\nSo, the critical temperature of helium is approximately 3.68 K."
