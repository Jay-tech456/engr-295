    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K). This nearly uniform temperature is observed throughout the universe and is a remnant of the early stages of the Big Bang.\n\nAccording to the standard Big Bang model of cosmology, the CMB radiation provides crucial evidence for the origin and evolution of our universe. It tells us that:\n\n1. The universe began as a hot, dense state: The CMB is a relic of the time when the universe was much hotter and denser. As the universe expanded and cooled, the energy from this early stage was stretched into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, forming the CMB radiation we observe today.\n\n2. The universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales: The CMB radiation is extremely uniform across the sky, with only tiny fluctuations in temperature (about 1 part in 100,000). This supports the cosmological principle, which states that the universe is the same in all directions and locations on large scales.\n\n3. The age of the universe: By studying the CMB radiation and its fluctuations, cosmologists can estimate the age of the universe. Current measurements suggest that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old.\n\n4. The composition of the universe: The CMB radiation allows us to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. Current observations indicate that about 5% of the universe is made up of ordinary matter, 27% is dark matter, and 68% is dark energy.\n\n5. The formation of cosmic structures: The tiny fluctuations in the CMB radiation are the seeds of the large-scale structures we see in the universe today, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. These fluctuations were caused by tiny variations in the density of matter in the early universe, which later grew under the influence of gravity to form the cosmic structures we observe today.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and its properties provide crucial insights into the origin, evolution, and composition of our universe, supporting the standard Big Bang model of cosmology."
