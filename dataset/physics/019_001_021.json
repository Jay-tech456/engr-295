    "message_2": "In a scalar field theory with quartic interaction, the interaction Lagrangian can be written as:\n\nL_int = -λ(ϕ^4)/4!\n\nwhere λ is the coupling constant and ϕ is the scalar field.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for a 2-to-2 scattering process can be calculated using the Feynman rules. In this case, we have one possible Feynman diagram, which is a single vertex connecting four scalar particles. The corresponding Feynman amplitude is given by:\n\nM = (-iλ)\n\nNow, we need to consider the momentum conservation at the vertex. Let's denote the incoming momenta as k and l, and the outgoing momenta as k' and l'. In the center of mass frame, we have:\n\nk = (E_k, 0, 0, k)\nl = (E_l, 0, 0, -l)\nk' = (E_k', k', 0, 0)\nl' = (E_l', -l', 0, 0)\n\nMomentum conservation at the vertex implies:\n\nk + l = k' + l'\n\nSince we are in the center of mass frame, we have E_k = E_l and E_k' = E_l'. Also, k = l and k' = l'. Thus, the momentum conservation equation simplifies to:\n\n2k = 2k'\n\nThis implies that k = k'. Therefore, the scattering process is elastic, and the particles are scattered with the same energy and magnitude of momentum as they had initially.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for this process is simply given by the Feynman amplitude:\n\nM = (-iλ)\n\nThis result shows that the scattering amplitude for a scalar field theory with quartic interaction in the center of mass frame is independent of the momenta of the particles and depends only on the coupling constant λ."
