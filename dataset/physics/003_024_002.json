    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law for a long solenoid. The formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (1000 turns/m), and I is the current (2 A).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB_inside = 8π × 10^(-4) T\n\nNow, to find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm (0.04 m) from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field outside a solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * n * I * r^2) / (2 * (R^2 + r^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B_outside is the magnetic field outside the solenoid, R is the radius of the solenoid, and r is the distance from the center of the coil.\n\nAssuming the solenoid has a radius R such that r > R, we can plug in the values:\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns/m) * (2 A) * (0.04 m)^2 / (2 * (R^2 + (0.04 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nSince we don't have the value of R, we cannot find the exact value of the magnetic field outside the solenoid at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the coil. However, we can say that the magnetic field outside the solenoid will be significantly weaker than the magnetic field inside the solenoid."
