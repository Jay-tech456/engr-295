    "message_2": "To find the distance between the two slits in a Young's double-slit experiment, we can use the formula for the interference pattern of bright fringes:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\n- y is the distance between the bright fringes (3.4 mm)\n- m is the order of the fringe (we'll assume m = 1 for the first bright fringe)\n- λ is the wavelength of the laser (650 nm = 6.5 * 10^-7 m)\n- L is the distance between the screen and the slits (unknown)\n- d is the distance between the two slits (what we want to find)\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of L. In most cases, the distance between the screen and the slits is much larger than the distance between the slits (L >> d). This allows us to use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first bright fringe. Using this approximation, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\ny = (λ * L) / d\n\nNow, we need to find the value of L. In a typical Young's double-slit experiment, the distance between the screen and the slits is usually around 1 meter. We can use this as an estimate for L:\n\nL ≈ 1 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for d:\n\n3.4 * 10^-3 m = (6.5 * 10^-7 m * 1 m) / d\n\nd = (6.5 * 10^-7 m * 1 m) / (3.4 * 10^-3 m)\n\nd ≈ 1.91 * 10^-4 m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in this Young's double-slit experiment is approximately 1.91 * 10^-4 meters or 191 micrometers."
