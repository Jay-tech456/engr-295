    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies is typically found in a roughly spherical halo surrounding the visible matter, such as stars, gas, and dust. This dark matter halo extends well beyond the visible edges of the galaxy, and its density decreases with increasing distance from the galactic center. Dark matter is believed to make up around 85% of the total mass in the universe, and it plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nThe presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the rotational curves of spiral galaxies. A rotational curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible matter (stars and gas) as a function of their distance from the galactic center. According to classical Newtonian physics, we would expect the orbital velocities to decrease as we move away from the center, similar to the behavior of planets in our solar system. However, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotational curves remain flat or even slightly increase with distance from the center, indicating that there is more mass present than what we can see.\n\nThis discrepancy between the expected and observed rotational curves is one of the primary pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter. The gravitational influence of the dark matter halo causes the visible matter in the galaxy to orbit at higher velocities than would be expected based on the mass of the visible matter alone. This results in the flat or increasing rotational curves that we observe.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies is predominantly in a spherical halo surrounding the visible matter. Its presence significantly affects the rotational curves of these galaxies, causing them to deviate from the expected behavior based on visible mass alone. This deviation provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and its crucial role in shaping the dynamics of galaxies."
