    "message_2": "The approximate ratio of dark matter to visible matter (also known as baryonic matter) in the universe is about 5:1. This means that for every unit of visible matter, there are approximately five units of dark matter. This ratio is derived from various observations and measurements, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy rotation curves, and gravitational lensing.\n\nHowever, the ratio of dark matter to visible matter can vary in different galactic structures. In general, dark matter is more dominant in larger structures, such as galaxy clusters and the outer regions of galaxies. In these areas, the ratio of dark matter to visible matter can be much higher than the average 5:1 ratio.\n\nOn the other hand, in smaller structures like dwarf galaxies or the inner regions of spiral galaxies, the ratio of dark matter to visible matter can be lower. This is because visible matter, such as stars and gas, is more concentrated in these regions, while dark matter is more evenly distributed throughout the structure.\n\nIt is important to note that these ratios are approximate and can vary depending on the specific galactic structure being studied. Additionally, our understanding of dark matter and its distribution in the universe is still evolving, so these ratios may be subject to change as new information becomes available."
