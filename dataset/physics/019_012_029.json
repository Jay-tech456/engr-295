    "message_2": "There are several methods used for calculating non-perturbative effects in quantum field theory (QFT). These methods are essential for studying the behavior of strongly interacting particles, as perturbation theory is not applicable in such cases. Some of the prominent methods include:\n\n1. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (Lattice QCD): Lattice QCD is a non-perturbative approach to solving QFT problems by discretizing space-time into a lattice. This method is particularly useful for studying the strong force, which is responsible for binding quarks and gluons within hadrons. By simulating QCD on a lattice, one can compute various properties of hadrons, such as their masses and decay constants.\n\n2. Functional methods: Functional methods, such as the functional renormalization group (FRG) and the Schwinger-Dyson equations, are used to study non-perturbative effects in QFT. These methods involve the use of functional integrals and Green's functions to describe the dynamics of the system. They can be applied to study various strongly interacting systems, including quantum chromodynamics and condensed matter systems.\n\n3. Effective field theories (EFTs): EFTs are a powerful tool for studying non-perturbative effects in QFT. They involve constructing a low-energy theory that captures the relevant degrees of freedom and symmetries of the underlying high-energy theory. EFTs can be applied to study various strongly interacting systems, such as nuclear forces, heavy quark systems, and low-energy QCD.\n\n4. AdS/CFT correspondence: The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the holographic principle, is a conjectured duality between a strongly coupled conformal field theory (CFT) and a weakly coupled gravity theory in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. This correspondence allows for the study of non-perturbative effects in strongly coupled gauge theories by mapping them to a weakly coupled gravity theory, which can be more easily analyzed.\n\n5. Resummation techniques: Resummation techniques, such as the Borel resummation and the renormalon method, are used to sum up the perturbative series in a controlled manner, capturing non-perturbative effects that arise from the divergence of the series. These techniques can be applied to study various strongly interacting systems, including QCD and electroweak interactions.\n\nThese methods can be applied to study the behavior of strongly interacting particles by providing a framework for calculating non-perturbative effects in QFT. By using these techniques, physicists can gain insights into the properties of strongly interacting systems, such as the confinement of quarks and gluons, the structure of hadrons, and the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems in condensed matter physics."
