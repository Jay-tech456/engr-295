    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and the transparent material), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of the transparent material), and θ1 = 60 degrees.\n\nWe can rearrange Snell's Law to solve for θ2:\n\nθ2 = arcsin[(n1 * sin(θ1)) / n2]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nθ2 = arcsin[(1 * sin(60)) / 1.5]\n\nθ2 = arcsin[(1 * 0.866) / 1.5]\n\nθ2 = arcsin[0.866 / 1.5]\n\nθ2 = arcsin[0.577]\n\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 35.3 degrees."
