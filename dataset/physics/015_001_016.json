    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of the gravitational wave\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM = total mass of the binary system (50 solar masses)\nω = angular frequency of the binary system\nr = orbital separation (10000 km)\nc = speed of light (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)\nD = distance from the observer (1 billion light-years)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to SI units:\n\nM = 50 solar masses = 50 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 9.9425 × 10^31 kg\nr = 10000 km = 1 × 10^7 m\nD = 1 billion light-years = 1 × 10^9 * 9.4607 × 10^15 m = 9.4607 × 10^24 m\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use Kepler's third law to find the orbital period T:\n\nT^2 = (4 * π^2 * r^3) / (G * M)\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = sqrt((4 * π^2 * r^3) / (G * M))\nT ≈ 1.141 × 10^3 s\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency ω:\n\nω = 2 * π / T\nω ≈ 5.499 × 10^-3 s^-1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational wave h:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * D)\nh ≈ 1.056 × 10^-22\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system is approximately 1.056 × 10^-22."
