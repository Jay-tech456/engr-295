    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability:\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere P(ν_μ → ν_e) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, θ is the mixing angle, Δm² is the mass squared difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates, L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km), and E is the neutrino energy (in GeV).\n\nGiven the values:\nΔm² = 2.32x10^-3 eV²\nsin²(2θ) = 0.860\nL = 730 km\nE = 10 GeV\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from GeV to eV since Δm² is given in eV². There are 1x10^9 eV in 1 GeV, so:\n\nE = 10 GeV * (1x10^9 eV/GeV) = 1x10^10 eV\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = 0.860 * sin²(1.27 * (2.32x10^-3 eV²) * (730 km) / (1x10^10 eV))\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = 0.860 * sin²(1.27 * (2.32x10^-3) * (730) / (1x10^4))\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = 0.860 * sin²(0.021)\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = 0.860 * sin²(0.021) ≈ 0.860 * (0.000304)\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) ≈ 0.000261\n\nSo, the probability of a 10 GeV muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino after traveling a distance of 730 km through the Earth's crust is approximately 0.000261, or 0.0261%."
