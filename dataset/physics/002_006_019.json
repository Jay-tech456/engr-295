    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of propane (C3H8) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure. Given the standard enthalpy of formation for propane is -103.8 kJ/mol and the standard enthalpy of combustion for propane is -2220 kJ/mol, what is the Gibbs free energy change for this reaction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of propane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nWe are given the standard enthalpy of combustion for propane (ΔH) as -2220 kJ/mol. However, we need to find the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction.\n\nThe balanced equation for the combustion of propane is:\n\nC3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)\n\nNow, we need to find the standard entropy values for each of the species involved in the reaction. The standard entropy values at 298 K are:\n\nC3H8(g): 269.9 J/mol·K\nO2(g): 205.1 J/mol·K\nCO2(g): 213.7 J/mol·K\nH2O(l): 69.9 J/mol·K\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for the reaction:\n\nΔS = [3(213.7) + 4(69.9)] - [(269.9) + 5(205.1)]\nΔS = (641.1 + 279.6) - (269.9 + 1025.5)\nΔS = 920.7 - 1295.4\nΔS = -374.7 J/mol·K\n\nNow that we have the change in entropy (ΔS), we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of propane:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\nΔG = -2220 kJ/mol - (298 K × -0.3747 kJ/mol·K)\nΔG = -2220 kJ/mol + 111.6 kJ/mol\nΔG = -2108.4 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of propane at 298 K and 1 atm pressure is -2108.4 kJ/mol."
