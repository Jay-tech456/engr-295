Assume that the wavelength of light is 500 nm and the angle of observation is 45 degrees. Given the speed of light c = 3 x 10^8 m/s. Solve for the angle of aberration using the relativistic formula: tanθ = (v/c)/(1+(v^2/c^2))^(1/2) * tanφ, where θ is the angle of aberration, v is the velocity of the observer, c is the speed of light, and φ is the angle of observation.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of aberration, we can use the given relativistic formula:\n\ntanθ = (v/c)/(1+(v^2/c^2))^(1/2) * tanφ\n\nwhere\nθ is the angle of aberration\nv is the velocity of the observer (0.8c)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nφ is the angle of observation (45 degrees)\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle of observation φ to radians:\n\nφ = 45 degrees * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ntanθ = (0.8c/c)/(1+(0.8c^2/c^2))^(1/2) * tan(π/4)\n\ntanθ = (0.8)/(1+(0.64))^(1/2) * 1\n\ntanθ = (0.8)/(1.8)^(1/2)\n\ntanθ ≈ 0.5976\n\nNow, we can find the angle of aberration θ by taking the arctangent of tanθ:\n\nθ = arctan(0.5976)\n\nθ ≈ 0.5404 radians\n\nTo convert the angle back to degrees:\n\nθ ≈ 0.5404 * (180/π) ≈ 30.96 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of aberration of the light source when the observer is moving at a velocity of 0.8c with respect to the source is approximately 30.96 degrees."
