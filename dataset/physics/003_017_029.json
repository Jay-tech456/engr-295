    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small current element (Idl) at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is symmetrical, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by one side of the loop and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The current element dl is perpendicular to the position vector r. Therefore, the angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, and the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, let's find the distance from the midpoint of one side of the square to the center of the square. Since the side length is 0.5 m, the distance from the midpoint of one side to the center is half the side length, which is 0.25 m. Therefore, r = 0.25 m.\n\nThe magnetic field produced by one side of the square loop at the center is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire length of one side, we get:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * ∫dl = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl over the entire length of one side is equal to the side length, which is 0.5 m. Therefore:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the total magnetic field at the center of the square loop by multiplying B_side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = 4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * 0.5\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB_total = 4 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (3 A / (0.25 m)²) * 0.5\nB_total = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (3 A / 0.0625 m²) * 0.5\nB_total ≈ 9.6 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 9.6 µT."
