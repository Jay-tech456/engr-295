    "message_1": "What is the probability of the process B→K(∗)l+l− (where l is either an electron or a muon) emitting a tau lepton instead of an electron or muon, in the framework of the Standard Model, and how does it compare to the same process in New Physics models which allow for lepton flavor violation?",
    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, lepton flavor is conserved, meaning that the flavor of a lepton cannot change during a weak interaction. Therefore, in the process B→K(∗)l+l− (where l is either an electron or a muon), the probability of emitting a tau lepton instead of an electron or muon is effectively zero.\n\nHowever, in some New Physics models, lepton flavor violation (LFV) is allowed. These models predict that the lepton flavor can change during weak interactions, which could lead to the emission of a tau lepton in the process B→K(∗)l+l−. The probability of this occurring depends on the specific model and the parameters involved.\n\nIt is important to note that experimental searches for LFV processes are ongoing, and any observation of such processes would be a clear indication of physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, no evidence of LFV in B meson decays has been observed, and experimental limits on the branching ratios for these processes are quite stringent. As a result, the probability of emitting a tau lepton in the process B→K(∗)l+l− remains very small, even in New Physics models that allow for LFV."
