    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section formula is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε₀))^2 * (1 / (2 * E * sin^2(θ/2))) * (1 + cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere:\n- dσ/dΩ is the differential cross section\n- Z is the atomic number of the target (for hydrogen, Z = 1)\n- e is the elementary charge (e ≈ 1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (ε₀ ≈ 8.854 x 10^(-12) C^2/Nm^2)\n- E is the energy of the incident electron (100 keV = 100 x 10^3 eV)\n- θ is the scattering angle (60 degrees)\n\nFirst, let's convert the scattering angle to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1 * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2 / (4 * π * 8.854 x 10^(-12)))^2 * (1 / (2 * 100 x 10^3 * sin^2(π/6))) * (1 + cos^2(π/3))\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (1.439 x 10^(-29))^2 * (1 / (2 * 100 x 10^3 * (1/4))) * (1 + (1/2)^2)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (2.071 x 10^(-58)) * (1 / (50 x 10^3)) * (1 + 1/4)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (2.071 x 10^(-58)) * (1 / (50 x 10^3)) * (5/4)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 5.18 x 10^(-62) m^2/sr\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for the scattering of a 100 keV electron from a hydrogen atom at a scattering angle of 60 degrees is approximately 5.18 x 10^(-62) m^2/sr."
