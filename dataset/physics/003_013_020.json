    "message_1": "A current-carrying ring of radius 0.05 m has a current of 2 A flowing through it. Calculate the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the ring, 0.1 m away from the center of the ring, assuming the ring is in the x-y plane and current is flowing in the clockwise direction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the ring, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the ring, and z is the distance from the center of the ring along the axis.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.05 m\nz = 0.1 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * 0.00035355 m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.78 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the point located 0.1 m away from the center of the ring along its axis is approximately 1.78 × 10^(-5) T."
