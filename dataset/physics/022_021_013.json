    "message_2": "The theoretical basis for the hypothesis that dark matter could be composed of extra-dimensional particles stems from the idea that our universe may have more than the four known dimensions (three spatial dimensions and one time dimension). This concept is primarily explored in the framework of string theory and its extension, M-theory, which posit that there are additional compactified dimensions that are too small to be directly observed.\n\nOne of the key motivations for considering extra-dimensional particles as dark matter candidates is the inability of the standard model of particle physics to explain the nature of dark matter. Observations of galaxy rotation curves, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure formation in the universe provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. However, none of the known particles in the standard model can account for these observations.\n\nExtra-dimensional particles, such as Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles, are potential dark matter candidates. In theories with extra dimensions, KK particles are higher-dimensional analogs of standard model particles, with their mass and other properties determined by the geometry and size of the extra dimensions. These particles could interact with our familiar particles through gravity or other forces, making them viable dark matter candidates.\n\nThere are several pieces of evidence that support or challenge the hypothesis of extra-dimensional dark matter:\n\n1. Support: The existence of extra dimensions could help explain the observed hierarchy between the electroweak scale (associated with the masses of the W and Z bosons) and the much larger Planck scale (associated with gravity). This hierarchy problem is one of the major puzzles in particle physics, and extra dimensions could provide a natural explanation for it.\n\n2. Support: Extra-dimensional dark matter candidates, such as KK particles, could provide the correct relic abundance of dark matter in the universe. This is an essential requirement for any viable dark matter candidate, as it must match the observed dark matter density.\n\n3. Challenge: Direct detection experiments, such as XENON1T and LUX, have not yet observed any signals consistent with extra-dimensional dark matter particles. These experiments search for dark matter by looking for its interactions with ordinary matter, and their null results place stringent constraints on the properties of potential dark matter candidates.\n\n4. Challenge: Collider experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), have not found any evidence for extra dimensions or particles associated with them. While the LHC primarily searches for new particles by producing them in high-energy collisions, it can also probe extra dimensions through indirect effects, such as deviations from the standard model predictions. So far, no such deviations have been observed.\n\nIn conclusion, the hypothesis that dark matter could be composed of extra-dimensional particles is an intriguing possibility that arises from the idea of additional dimensions in the universe. While there are some theoretical motivations for considering these particles as dark matter candidates, experimental evidence has not yet confirmed their existence. Further research, both in theoretical developments and experimental searches, is needed to determine whether extra-dimensional particles can indeed account for the dark matter in the universe."
