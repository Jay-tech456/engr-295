    "message_2": "The relativistic aberration formula is given by:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) - v) / (cos(θ) + (v * sin(θ) / (1 - v * cos(θ))))\n\nwhere θ is the incident angle, θ' is the angle of deflection, v is the relative speed of the moving object, and c is the speed of light. In this case, the incident angle θ is 45 degrees, and the relative speed v is 0.8c.\n\nFirst, let's convert the incident angle to radians:\n\nθ = 45 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(π / 4) - 0.8) / (cos(π / 4) + (0.8 * sin(π / 4) / (1 - 0.8 * cos(π / 4))))\n\nCalculating the values:\n\ntan(θ') ≈ (-0.171573) / (0.828427)\n\nθ' ≈ -0.207107\n\nNow, let's convert the angle of deflection back to degrees:\n\nθ' ≈ -0.207107 * (180 / π) ≈ -11.87 degrees\n\nThe angle of deflection of the light rays when they pass near a moving object at a relativistic speed of 0.8c is approximately -11.87 degrees. The negative sign indicates that the deflection is in the opposite direction of the moving object."
