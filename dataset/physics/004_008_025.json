    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a spinning black hole using the Penrose process, we need to consider the efficiency of the process. The efficiency of the Penrose process is given by:\n\nη = (1 - √(1 - a²)) / (1 + √(1 - a²))\n\nwhere a is the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole, defined as:\n\na = J / (GM²)\n\nHere, J is the angular momentum of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nFor a maximally spinning black hole, a = 1. In this case, the efficiency of the Penrose process is:\n\nη = (1 - √(1 - 1²)) / (1 + √(1 - 1²)) = 0.29\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe energy that can be extracted from the black hole is given by the product of its mass, the efficiency of the Penrose process, and the speed of light squared (c²):\n\nE = η * M * c²\n\nThe speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = 0.29 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)²\nE ≈ 5.13 x 10^47 Joules\n\nSo, the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a spinning black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses using the Penrose process and assuming that the outgoing particle has zero rest mass is approximately 5.13 x 10^47 Joules."
