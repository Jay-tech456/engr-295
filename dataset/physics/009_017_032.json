    "message_1": "A beam of 500 nm laser light is incident on a single slit with a width of 0.1 mm. If the distance between the slit and the screen is 1 m, what is the distance between the first and second minima on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minima, m is the order of the minima (m = 1 for the first minima, m = 2 for the second minima, and so on), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\nθ1 = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 5 * 10^(-6) radians\nθ2 = (2 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 10 * 10^(-6) radians\n\nNext, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance between the first and second minima on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere y is the linear distance on the screen, L is the distance between the slit and the screen, and θ is the angular position of the minima.\n\nFor the first minima:\n\ny1 = 1 * 5 * 10^(-6) = 5 * 10^(-6) m\n\nFor the second minima:\n\ny2 = 1 * 10 * 10^(-6) = 10 * 10^(-6) m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first and second minima:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = 10 * 10^(-6) - 5 * 10^(-6) = 5 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second minima on the screen is 5 * 10^(-6) meters, or 5 micrometers."
