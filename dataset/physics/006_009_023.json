    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Compton formula, which relates the initial and final wavelengths of a photon after scattering off an electron:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h / (m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\nΔλ is the change in wavelength\nλ is the initial wavelength of the photon\nλ' is the final wavelength of the photon\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nθ is the scattering angle\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial wavelength of the 1 MeV photon. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon. Rearranging for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nThe energy of the photon is given in MeV, so we need to convert it to Joules:\n\nE = 1 MeV * (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV) = 1.602 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow we can find the initial wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.602 x 10^-13 J) = 1.239 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow we need to find the change in wavelength (Δλ) due to the Compton effect. We are not given the scattering angle (θ), so we cannot find the exact value of Δλ. However, we can find the maximum change in wavelength, which occurs when the photon is scattered at an angle of 180 degrees (θ = π radians):\n\nΔλ_max = (h / (m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(π)) = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / ((9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 - (-1)) = 4.861 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow we can find the final wavelength of the scattered photon:\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ_max = 1.239 x 10^-12 m + 4.861 x 10^-12 m = 6.100 x 10^-12 m\n\nNext, we need to find the recoil energy of the electron. We can use the conservation of energy principle:\n\nE_initial = E_photon_initial + E_electron_initial\n\nSince the electron is initially stationary, its initial energy is zero:\n\nE_initial = E_photon_initial = 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J\n\nAfter the scattering, the energy is shared between the photon and the electron:\n\nE_final = E_photon_final + E_electron_final\n\nWe can find the final energy of the photon using its final wavelength:\n\nE_photon_final = h * c / λ' = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.100 x 10^-12 m) = 3.253 x 10^-14 J\n\nNow we can find the recoil energy of the electron:\n\nE_electron_final = E_initial - E_photon_final = 1.602 x 10^-13 J - 3.253 x 10^-14 J = 1.277 x 10^-13 J\n\nSo, the wavelength of the scattered photon is 6.100 x 10^-12 m, and the recoil energy of the electron is 1.277 x 10^-13 J."
