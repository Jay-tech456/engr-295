    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns per meter), and I is the current in amperes.\n\nGiven the values:\nn = 500 turns/meter\nI = 2 A\n\nWe can now calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (500 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns*m^(-1))\n\nB ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 6.28 × 10^(-4) T (tesla)."
