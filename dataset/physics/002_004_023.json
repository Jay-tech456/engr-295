    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nNext, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of formation are as follows:\n\nΔHf°(CH₄) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(O₂) = 0 kJ/mol (since O₂ is in its standard state)\nΔHf°(CO₂) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf°(H₂O) = -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction (ΔHrxn) using the following equation:\n\nΔHrxn = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]\n\nΔHrxn = [1 mol × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 mol × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 mol × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 kJ + 2 × -241.8 kJ) - (2 × -74.8 kJ)\n\nΔHrxn = (-393.5 kJ - 483.6 kJ) - (-149.6 kJ)\n\nΔHrxn = -877.1 kJ + 149.6 kJ\n\nΔHrxn = -727.5 kJ\n\nSince we are calculating the enthalpy change for the reaction of burning 2 moles of methane gas, we need to multiply the enthalpy change for 1 mole by 2:\n\nΔHrxn (2 moles of CH₄) = 2 × (-727.5 kJ)\n\nΔHrxn (2 moles of CH₄) = -1455 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction of burning 2 moles of methane gas is -1455 kJ."
