    "message_2": "The probability of creating a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a heavy-ion collision depends on several factors, including the center-of-mass energy, the size of the colliding nuclei, and the impact parameter of the collision. In this answer, we will provide a general outline of the theoretical calculation for different values of center-of-mass energy and discuss the conditions under which the QGP can be observed experimentally.\n\n1. Theoretical calculation:\n\nThe probability of creating a QGP in a heavy-ion collision can be estimated using the nuclear overlap function T_AB(b), which represents the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at a given impact parameter b. This function depends on the size of the colliding nuclei (A and B) and their nuclear density distributions.\n\nT_AB(b) = ∫ d^2r T_A(r) T_B(|r - b|)\n\nwhere T_A(r) and T_B(r) are the thickness functions of the colliding nuclei A and B, respectively.\n\nThe probability of creating a QGP can then be related to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions N_coll and the inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross-section σ_NN:\n\nP_QGP = N_coll(b) * σ_NN * P_QGP_NN\n\nwhere P_QGP_NN is the probability of creating a QGP in a single nucleon-nucleon collision, which depends on the center-of-mass energy.\n\nTo estimate P_QGP_NN, one can use perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations for the parton-parton cross-sections and the energy density of the produced partons. The critical energy density for the QGP formation can be obtained from lattice QCD simulations. If the energy density of the produced partons is above the critical value, a QGP is expected to form.\n\nFor different values of center-of-mass energy, one can calculate P_QGP_NN using pQCD and lattice QCD results, and then estimate the overall probability P_QGP using the nuclear overlap function T_AB(b).\n\n2. Experimental observation of QGP:\n\nThe QGP can be observed experimentally through various signatures, such as:\n\na. Jet quenching: The energy loss of high-energy partons (quarks and gluons) traversing the QGP medium leads to a suppression of high transverse momentum particles and jets in the final state.\n\nb. Quarkonium suppression: The screening of the heavy quark-antiquark potential in the QGP medium leads to a suppression of quarkonium states (e.g., J/ψ, Υ) in the final state.\n\nc. Collective flow: The expansion of the QGP medium under high pressure gradients leads to a collective flow of the produced particles, which can be observed as anisotropic azimuthal distributions (elliptic flow, triangular flow, etc.).\n\nd. Strangeness enhancement: The increased production of strange and multi-strange particles (e.g., K, Λ, Ξ, Ω) in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions can be attributed to the formation of a QGP.\n\nTo observe the QGP experimentally, one needs to perform heavy-ion collisions at high center-of-mass energies, such as those achieved at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). By measuring the above-mentioned signatures and comparing them to theoretical predictions and baseline measurements from proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, one can establish the formation of a QGP in heavy-ion collisions."
