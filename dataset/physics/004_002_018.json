    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. The radius of the event horizon is also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 10 solar masses, we first need to convert this to kilograms. One solar mass (Ms) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 10 Ms = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of the black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses has a radius of approximately 29.5 kilometers (2.95 x 10^4 m). The radius of the event horizon is the same as the Schwarzschild radius, as they both describe the same boundary."
