    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a star can have before it collapses into a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. However, this limit is derived using general relativity, not special relativity. The TOV limit is approximately 3 solar masses (M☉), although the exact value depends on the equation of state of the stellar matter.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the resulting black hole, we can use the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c²\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nAssuming the mass of the black hole is equal to the TOV limit (3 M☉), we can convert this to kilograms:\n\n1 M☉ = 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg\n3 M☉ = 3 × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 5.967 × 10³⁰ kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 × (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) × (5.967 × 10³⁰ kg) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nRs ≈ 8.85 × 10³ m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of the resulting black hole is approximately 8.85 kilometers.\n\nTo compare this to the size of the original star, we need to know the radius of the star. A typical neutron star, which is the remnant of a massive star that has not collapsed into a black hole, has a radius of about 10-15 kilometers. The Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is smaller than the size of the original star, meaning that the star has collapsed into a much smaller volume, forming a black hole."
