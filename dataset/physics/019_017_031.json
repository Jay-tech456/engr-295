    "message_2": "The Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) is a set of integral equations that describe the dynamics of quantum fields. In scalar electrodynamics, the SDE for the electron propagator can be derived from the functional derivative of the generating functional with respect to the external source. The electron propagator is represented by the two-point Green's function, which is the inverse of the full electron self-energy.\n\nTo calculate the SDE for the electron propagator up to the three-loop level, we need to consider the contributions from the one-loop, two-loop, and three-loop diagrams. The one-loop contribution comes from the self-energy diagram with a single scalar boson loop. The two-loop contribution comes from diagrams with two scalar boson loops, and the three-loop contribution comes from diagrams with three scalar boson loops.\n\nThe perturbative expansion of the electron propagator can be obtained by expanding the full electron self-energy in powers of the coupling constant. The one-loop contribution corresponds to the first-order term in the perturbative expansion, the two-loop contribution corresponds to the second-order term, and the three-loop contribution corresponds to the third-order term.\n\nTo compare the SDE calculation with the perturbative expansion, we need to solve the SDE up to the three-loop level and compare the resulting expressions for the electron propagator with the corresponding terms in the perturbative expansion. In general, the SDE calculation provides a non-perturbative approach to the problem, which can capture the effects of strong coupling and resummation of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion.\n\nHowever, solving the SDE up to the three-loop level is a highly complex task that requires advanced techniques in quantum field theory and numerical methods. The comparison between the SDE calculation and the perturbative expansion can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the electron propagator in scalar electrodynamics, especially in the strong coupling regime."
