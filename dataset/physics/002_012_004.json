    "message_2": "To calculate the work done on the gas during an isothermal process, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nGiven:\nInitial volume (V1) = 2.5 L\nFinal volume (V2) = 1 L\nConstant pressure (P) = 1 atm\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in volume (ΔV):\n\nΔV = V2 - V1\nΔV = 1 L - 2.5 L\nΔV = -1.5 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done (W):\n\nW = -P * ΔV\nW = -(1 atm) * (-1.5 L)\n\nTo convert the work done to Joules, we need to use the conversion factor: 1 L·atm = 101.325 J\n\nW = 1.5 L·atm * (101.325 J / 1 L·atm)\nW = 151.9875 J\n\nTherefore, the work done on the gas during this isothermal process is approximately 152 J."
