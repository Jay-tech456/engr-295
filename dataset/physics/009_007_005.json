    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a focal length of -15 cm. If an object is placed 25 cm in front of the mirror, what is the image distance from the mirror and is the image real or virtual?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is -15 cm and the object distance (do) is 25 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/(-15) = 1/25 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-25/375 = 15/375 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 15/375 from both sides:\n\n-40/375 = 1/di\n\nTo find di, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 375/(-40)\n\ndi = -9.375 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is -9.375 cm. Since the image distance is negative, it means the image is formed on the same side as the object, which indicates that the image is virtual."
