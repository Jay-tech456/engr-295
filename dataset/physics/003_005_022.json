    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance from a long straight wire carrying current, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 2.5 A and the distance r = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m, we can now calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (10^(-7) * 2.5) / 0.04\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-7) / 0.04\n\nB = 6.25 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 4.0 cm from the wire is approximately 6.25 × 10^(-6) T or 6.25 µT."
