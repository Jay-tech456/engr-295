Find the specific volume of the mixture in m³/kg.",
    "message_2": "To find the specific volume of the mixture, we can use the ideal gas law equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperature and pressure to SI units:\n\nTemperature (T) = 100°C = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K\nPressure (P) = 1.5 bar = 1.5 * 10^5 Pa\n\nNext, we need to find the average molecular weight of the mixture. Since the mixture consists of 15% water vapor by mole fraction, the mole fraction of air is 85%. We can calculate the average molecular weight (M) as follows:\n\nM = (mole fraction of air * molecular weight of air) + (mole fraction of water vapor * molecular weight of water vapor)\nM = (0.85 * 28.96 kg/kmol) + (0.15 * 18.02 kg/kmol)\nM = 24.604 kg/kmol\n\nNow, we can find the gas constant for the mixture (R_mix) by dividing the universal gas constant (R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)) by the average molecular weight (M):\n\nR_mix = R / M\nR_mix = 8.314 J/(mol·K) / 24.604 kg/kmol\nR_mix = 0.338 J/(kg·K)\n\nNow we can rearrange the ideal gas law equation to find the specific volume (v = V/m):\n\nv = RT/P\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nv = (0.338 J/(kg·K) * 373.15 K) / (1.5 * 10^5 Pa)\nv = 0.1262 J/Pa\n\nSince 1 J/Pa = 1 m³/kg, the specific volume of the mixture is:\n\nv = 0.1262 m³/kg"
