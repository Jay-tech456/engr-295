    "message_2": "To determine the value of the strong coupling constant (α_s) at a specific energy scale, we need to use the concept of the running coupling constant in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The strong coupling constant depends on the energy scale (Q) at which it is measured, and it decreases as the energy scale increases. This behavior is known as asymptotic freedom.\n\nThe value of α_s(Q) can be calculated using the renormalization group equation, which relates the coupling constant at different energy scales. One common parameterization of this equation is given by the following formula:\n\nα_s(Q) = α_s(Q₀) / (1 + (b₀ * α_s(Q₀) * ln(Q² / Q₀²) / (2 * π)))\n\nHere, Q₀ is the reference energy scale, α_s(Q₀) is the strong coupling constant at the reference energy scale, b₀ is the one-loop beta function coefficient, and Q is the energy scale at which we want to determine the strong coupling constant.\n\nFor QCD with five active quark flavors (u, d, s, c, b), the one-loop beta function coefficient b₀ is given by:\n\nb₀ = (33 - 2 * N_f) / 12π, where N_f is the number of active quark flavors.\n\nIn our case, N_f = 5, so b₀ = (33 - 2 * 5) / 12π = 11 / 12π.\n\nThe reference energy scale Q₀ is often chosen as the Z boson mass, which is approximately 91.2 GeV. The value of α_s at this energy scale, α_s(Q₀), is approximately 0.1181 (according to the Particle Data Group).\n\nNow we can calculate α_s(91.2 GeV) using the formula:\n\nα_s(91.2 GeV) = α_s(Q₀) / (1 + (b₀ * α_s(Q₀) * ln(Q² / Q₀²) / (2 * π)))\n\nSince we are calculating α_s at the same energy scale as the reference energy scale (Q = Q₀ = 91.2 GeV), the logarithmic term ln(Q² / Q₀²) becomes ln(1) = 0. Therefore, the entire term inside the parentheses becomes 1, and we get:\n\nα_s(91.2 GeV) = α_s(Q₀) = 0.1181\n\nSo, the value of the strong coupling constant at the energy scale of 91.2 GeV is approximately 0.1181."
