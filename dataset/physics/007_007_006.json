    "message_2": "In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the relationship between the magnetic field strength (B) and the resonance frequency (ν) of a proton is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nν = γ * B / (2 * π)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, which is approximately 42.58 MHz/T.\n\nFor a magnetic field of 1 T, the resonance frequency of a proton can be calculated as:\n\nν = (42.58 MHz/T) * (1 T) / (2 * π)\nν ≈ 6.76 MHz\n\nNow, to calculate the resonance frequency of a proton in a magnetic field of 3 T, we can simply plug in the new magnetic field value into the Larmor equation:\n\nν = (42.58 MHz/T) * (3 T) / (2 * π)\nν ≈ 20.28 MHz\n\nSo, the resonance frequency of a proton in a magnetic field of 3 T is approximately 20.28 MHz."
