    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of a coaxial cable with an inner conductor radius of 0.5 cm and an outer conductor radius of 1 cm, carrying a current of 5 A?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of a coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the cable. Since we are looking for the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center, we are outside the outer conductor (which has a radius of 1 cm). In this case, the total current enclosed by the loop is zero, as the current in the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current in the outer conductor.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is 0 T (tesla)."
