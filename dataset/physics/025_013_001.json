    "message_2": "The perception of color in the human eye is primarily determined by the wavelength of light. The human eye contains specialized cells called cones, which are responsible for detecting color. There are three types of cones: S-cones (sensitive to short wavelengths), M-cones (sensitive to medium wavelengths), and L-cones (sensitive to long wavelengths). These cones are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths, corresponding to the colors blue, green, and red, respectively.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it is absorbed by the cones, which then send signals to the brain to be interpreted as color. The color we perceive is determined by the combination of signals from the three types of cones. For example, if the light has a wavelength that primarily stimulates the L-cones, we perceive the color as red.\n\nTo optimize the design of artificial lighting for specific visual tasks, we can apply this knowledge of how the wavelength of light affects color perception. For instance, if a task requires high visual acuity and contrast, such as reading or intricate work, a light source with a higher color temperature (i.e., a higher proportion of blue light) would be beneficial. This is because blue light has shorter wavelengths, which can improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, if a task requires a more relaxing environment, such as in a bedroom or living room, a light source with a lower color temperature (i.e., a higher proportion of red and yellow light) would be more suitable. This is because longer wavelengths are associated with a warmer, more relaxing ambiance.\n\nIn summary, understanding the relationship between the wavelength of light and color perception in the human eye allows us to design artificial lighting that is tailored to specific visual tasks and environments. By selecting the appropriate color temperature and wavelength distribution, we can create lighting that enhances visual performance, comfort, and overall well-being."
