    "message_2": "To determine the angle of refraction of the light ray, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\n\nSnell's Law: n1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nWhere:\nn1 = refractive index of the first medium (air) = 1.0\nθ1 = angle of incidence = 30°\nn2 = refractive index of the second medium (glass) = 1.5\nθ2 = angle of refraction (unknown)\n\nWe want to find θ2, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n\nsin(θ2) = (n1 * sin(θ1)) / n2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.0 * sin(30°)) / 1.5\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5, so:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.0 * 0.5) / 1.5\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.3333\n\nNow, to find the angle of refraction θ2, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\nθ2 ≈ 19.47°\n\nTherefore, the angle of refraction of the light ray is approximately 19.47°."
