    "message_2": "In quantum teleportation, the goal is to transfer a quantum state from one location to another using a pre-shared entangled Bell state and classical communication. The protocol involves three qubits: the input state (qubit A), and the two entangled qubits (qubits B and C). The process can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Alice has the input state (qubit A) she wants to teleport, and one half of the entangled Bell state (qubit B).\n2. Bob has the other half of the entangled Bell state (qubit C).\n3. Alice performs a joint measurement on qubits A and B, obtaining one of the four possible Bell states.\n4. Alice sends the result of her measurement to Bob through classical communication.\n5. Bob applies a unitary transformation to his qubit C based on Alice's measurement result, obtaining the original input state.\n\nThe probability of successfully teleporting a quantum state using the quantum teleportation protocol, given an entangled Bell state and a random input state, is 100%. This is because the protocol is deterministic and does not rely on any probabilistic processes. As long as the entangled Bell state is shared correctly and the protocol is followed, the teleportation will always be successful.\n\nHowever, the fidelity of the Bell state can affect the success of the teleportation. Fidelity is a measure of how close the actual state is to the ideal state. If the fidelity of the Bell state decreases, the probability of successfully teleporting the quantum state will also decrease. The relationship between the fidelity of the Bell state and the success probability of the teleportation can be quantified using the following formula:\n\nP_success = F + (1 - F) / 2\n\nwhere P_success is the probability of successful teleportation and F is the fidelity of the Bell state. As the fidelity F decreases, the success probability P_success also decreases. When F = 1 (perfect fidelity), P_success = 1 (100% success probability). When F = 0 (no entanglement), P_success = 1/2 (50% success probability, equivalent to random guessing)."
