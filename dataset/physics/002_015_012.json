    "message_1": "A heat pump is being used to cool a room with an ambient temperature of 30°C. The room requires a cooling power of 5,000 watts, and the heat pump's compressor has a power consumption of 3 kW. The heat pump's evaporator is at a temperature of 10°C, and the condenser is at a temperature of 40°C. Calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the cooling power (Q_cool) to the power consumed by the compressor (W_comp). In this case, the cooling power required is 5,000 watts, and the power consumption of the compressor is 3,000 watts (3 kW).\n\nCOP = Q_cool / W_comp\n\nTo calculate the COP, we can simply plug in the given values:\n\nCOP = 5000 W / 3000 W\n\nCOP = 1.67\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 1.67."
