    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at a velocity of 0.9c relative to the earth. There is an astronaut in the spaceship who measures the time taken for a clock to tick 10 times on the spaceship. The astronaut measures the time to be 10 seconds. Calculate the time taken for the same 10 ticks of the clock as measured by a stationary observer on earth. Use the formulas of time dilation in a moving frame of reference to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the time dilation formula in special relativity, which is given by:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time interval measured by the stationary observer on Earth (the \"dilated\" time), Δt0 is the time interval measured by the astronaut in the moving spaceship (the \"proper\" time), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, we are given:\n\nΔt0 = 10 seconds (time measured by the astronaut)\nv = 0.9c (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth)\nc = speed of light\n\nWe want to find Δt, the time measured by the stationary observer on Earth. Plugging the given values into the time dilation formula, we get:\n\nΔt = 10 / √(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the square root:\n\nΔt = 10 / √(1 - 0.81)\n\nΔt = 10 / √(0.19)\n\nNow, calculating the square root and dividing:\n\nΔt ≈ 10 / 0.43589\n\nΔt ≈ 22.94 seconds\n\nSo, the stationary observer on Earth would measure the time taken for the same 10 ticks of the clock to be approximately 22.94 seconds."
