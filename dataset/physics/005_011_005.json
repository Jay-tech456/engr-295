    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of a particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the rest mass m_0 = 2.0 kg and the velocity v = 0.8c, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nm_rel = 2.0 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nm_rel = 2.0 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm_rel = 2.0 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm_rel = 2.0 kg / 0.6\n\nm_rel â‰ˆ 3.33 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the particle is approximately 3.33 kg."
