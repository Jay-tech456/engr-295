    "message_2": "The Casimir force between two parallel plates in a vacuum of a QED field at zero temperature can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nF_C = (π²ħcA) / (480d⁴)\n\nwhere:\nF_C is the Casimir force,\nħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js),\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s),\nA is the area of each plate,\nand d is the distance between the plates.\n\nBy plugging in the given values for A and d, you can calculate the Casimir force between the two parallel plates."
