Calculate the estimated amount of energy released in such an event, assuming a coolant loss of 10,000 kg of liquid lithium at a temperature of 500°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in this event, we need to consider the specific heat capacity of liquid lithium and the temperature change. The specific heat capacity of liquid lithium is approximately 3580 J/(kg·K).\n\nFirst, let's convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT_initial = 500°C + 273.15 = 773.15 K\nT_final = 273.15 K (assuming the coolant will lose all its heat and reach room temperature)\n\nNow, let's calculate the temperature change:\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 273.15 K - 773.15 K = -500 K\n\nSince the coolant is losing heat, the temperature change is negative. However, we are interested in the amount of energy released, which is a positive value. So, we will use the absolute value of the temperature change:\n\n|ΔT| = 500 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released (Q) using the formula:\n\nQ = mass × specific heat capacity × |ΔT|\n\nQ = 10,000 kg × 3580 J/(kg·K) × 500 K\n\nQ = 10,000 kg × 3580 J/(kg·K) × 500 K = 1.79 × 10^10 J\n\nTherefore, the estimated amount of energy released in this event is 1.79 × 10^10 Joules."
