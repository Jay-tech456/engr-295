    "message_2": "In a 2D conformal field theory (CFT), the Virasoro algebra is generated by the stress-energy tensor T(z) and its antiholomorphic counterpart T̄(z̄). For a massless free scalar field φ(z, z̄), the stress-energy tensor is given by:\n\nT(z) = -1/2 (∂φ(z, z̄))^2 + iβ∂^2φ(z, z̄),\n\nwhere β is a constant related to the normalization of the field φ.\n\nThe primary operators in this CFT are the vertex operators V_α(z, z̄) = e^(iαφ(z, z̄)), where α is a constant. To find the scaling dimensions of these primary operators, we need to compute their conformal weights (h, h̄) under the action of the stress-energy tensor T(z) and T̄(z̄).\n\nUsing the OPE of T(z) with V_α(w, w̄):\n\nT(z)V_α(w, w̄) = (∂φ(z, z̄))^2 V_α(w, w̄) + iβ∂^2φ(z, z̄)V_α(w, w̄),\n\nwe find that the conformal weights are given by:\n\nh = α^2 / 4π + βα / 2π,\nh̄ = α^2 / 4π - βα / 2π.\n\nThe scaling dimensions (Δ, Δ̄) are related to the conformal weights as Δ = h and Δ̄ = h̄. Thus, the scaling dimensions of the primary operators are:\n\nΔ = α^2 / 4π + βα / 2π,\nΔ̄ = α^2 / 4π - βα / 2π.\n\nNow, let's calculate the structure constant of the Virasoro algebra. The structure constant C_α1,α2,α3 is defined through the operator product expansion (OPE) of the vertex operators:\n\nV_α1(z_1, z̄_1)V_α2(z_2, z̄_2) = C_α1,α2,α3 V_α3(z_3, z̄_3) + ...,\n\nwhere α3 = α1 + α2, and the ellipsis denotes less singular terms.\n\nUsing the Wick theorem and the OPE of the free scalar field φ, we can compute the structure constant:\n\nC_α1,α2,α3 = ⟨V_α1(z_1, z̄_1)V_α2(z_2, z̄_2)V_α3(z_3, z̄_3)⟩\n= exp(iα1α2 G(z_12, z̄_12) + iα1α3 G(z_13, z̄_13) + iα2α3 G(z_23, z̄_23)),\n\nwhere G(z, z̄) is the Green's function of the massless free scalar field φ, and z_ij = z_i - z_j.\n\nIn summary, the scaling dimensions of the primary operators in a 2D massless free scalar field CFT are given by:\n\nΔ = α^2 / 4π + βα / 2π,\nΔ̄ = α^2 / 4π - βα / 2π,\n\nand the structure constant of the Virasoro algebra is:\n\nC_α1,α2,α3 = exp(iα1α2 G(z_12, z̄_12) + iα1α3 G(z_13, z̄_13) + iα2α3 G(z_23, z̄_23))."
