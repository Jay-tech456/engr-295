    "message_1": "A circular loop of radius 0.2 meters carries a current of 2 amperes. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.2 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.4 m\n\nB = 20π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 20π × 10⁻⁷ T or 6.28 × 10⁻⁶ T."
