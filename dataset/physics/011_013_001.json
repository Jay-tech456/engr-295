    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance. We can use the formula for resistance:\n\nR = ρ * (L / A)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, ρ is the resistivity, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the wire. Since the wire is cylindrical, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * (d / 2)^2\n\nwhere A is the area and d is the diameter of the wire.\n\nA = π * (1.5 x 10^-3 m / 2)^2\nA ≈ 1.7671 x 10^-6 m^2\n\nNow we can find the resistance of the wire:\n\nR = (1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm) * (10 m / 1.7671 x 10^-6 m^2)\nR ≈ 0.0095 Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nSince we know the resistivity (ρ) of copper at 25°C is 1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm, we can calculate the electrical conductivity:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.95 x 10^7 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of the copper wire with a diameter of 1.5 mm and a length of 10 meters at a temperature of 25°C is approximately 5.95 x 10^7 S/m."
