    "message_2": "The Penrose process is a mechanism by which energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole. It involves particles falling into the ergosphere of the black hole, where they can gain energy from the black hole's rotation. The efficiency of energy extraction in the Penrose process depends on the angular momentum of the black hole, which is related to the spin parameter (a).\n\nThe efficiency of the Penrose process can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - sqrt(1 - (a/M)^2))\n\nwhere a is the specific angular momentum of the black hole and M is the mass of the black hole. The spin parameter is defined as a/M, which ranges from 0 (non-rotating black hole) to 1 (extremal black hole, rotating at the maximum possible rate).\n\nAs the spin parameter (a/M) increases, the efficiency of energy extraction in the Penrose process also increases. For a non-rotating black hole (a/M = 0), the efficiency is 0, meaning no energy can be extracted. On the other hand, for an extremal black hole (a/M = 1), the efficiency reaches its maximum value of 0.29 or 29%.\n\nIn summary, the efficiency of energy extraction in the Penrose process for a rotating black hole depends on its specific angular momentum and increases with the spin parameter of the black hole. The efficiency ranges from 0% for a non-rotating black hole to a maximum of 29% for an extremal black hole."
