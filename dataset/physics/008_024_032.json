    "message_2": "A Z' boson is a hypothetical new heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. If a Z' boson were to be discovered in electron-positron scattering experiments at the LHC, it would manifest itself through several signatures:\n\n1. Resonance peak: The most prominent signature of a Z' boson would be a resonance peak in the invariant mass distribution of the final state particles (e.g., electron-positron pairs or other fermion-antifermion pairs). This peak would appear at the mass of the Z' boson and would be distinguishable from the background processes.\n\n2. Cross-section enhancement: The production cross-section of the electron-positron scattering process would be enhanced due to the presence of the Z' boson. This enhancement would be more significant near the resonance peak and could be observed as an excess of events compared to the Standard Model predictions.\n\n3. Angular distributions: The angular distributions of the final state particles in the electron-positron scattering process could be affected by the presence of the Z' boson. Depending on the couplings of the Z' boson to the fermions, the angular distributions could show deviations from the Standard Model predictions.\n\n4. Polarization effects: If the Z' boson has different couplings to left-handed and right-handed fermions, it could lead to polarization-dependent effects in the electron-positron scattering process. This could be observed as asymmetries in the production cross-sections for different initial state polarizations.\n\n5. Decays to exotic particles: If the Z' boson has couplings to new exotic particles beyond the Standard Model, it could decay into these particles, leading to unusual final states in the electron-positron scattering process. These exotic decays could be identified through their unique signatures in the detector.\n\nIn summary, the signatures of a newly discovered Z' boson in electron-positron scattering experiments at the LHC would include a resonance peak in the invariant mass distribution, enhanced cross-sections, deviations in angular distributions, polarization-dependent effects, and possibly decays to exotic particles. These signatures would provide crucial evidence for the existence of the Z' boson and help to shed light on new physics beyond the Standard Model."
