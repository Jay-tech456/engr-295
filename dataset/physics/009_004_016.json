    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for which total internal reflection occurs at the air-prism interface, we first need to determine the critical angle for the glass-air interface. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence at which the refracted angle is 90 degrees. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (glass), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (air), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nSince we are looking for the critical angle, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees. The refractive index of air is approximately 1. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\n1.5 * sin(θc) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θc) = 1 / 1.5\nθc = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum angle of incidence in air (θi) for which the light ray undergoes total internal reflection at the air-prism interface. Since the light ray is incident on the prism, the angle of incidence in air (θi) and the angle of refraction in the glass (θr) are related by Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(θi) = 1.5 * sin(θr)\n\nWe know that for total internal reflection to occur, the angle of incidence inside the prism (θr) must be greater than or equal to the critical angle (θc). So, we can write:\n\nsin(θi) = 1.5 * sin(θc)\n\nθi = arcsin(1.5 * sin(θc))\n\nθi ≈ arcsin(1.5 * sin(41.81))\n\nθi ≈ 60.98 degrees\n\nTherefore, the minimum angle of incidence in air for which a light ray incident on the prism undergoes total internal reflection at the air-prism interface is approximately 60.98 degrees."
