    "message_2": "To calculate the number of WIMPs passing through the detector, we need to consider the flux of WIMPs and the interaction probability with the detector. \n\nFirst, let's convert the given mass and cross-section to SI units.\n\nMass of dark matter particle (m_WIMP) = 1 TeV/c² = (1 × 10^12 eV) / (c²) = (1 × 10^12 eV) / ( (3 × 10^8 m/s)² )\nUsing the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) J, we get:\n\nm_WIMP = (1 × 10^12 × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J) / (9 × 10^16 m²/s²) = 1.78 × 10^(-25) kg\n\nCross-section (σ) = 10^(-4) pb = 10^(-4) × 10^(-36) m² = 10^(-40) m²\n\nNow, let's estimate the flux of WIMPs (Φ). The local dark matter density (ρ) is approximately 0.3 GeV/cm³. Converting to SI units:\n\nρ = 0.3 GeV/cm³ × (10^6 cm³/m³) × (1.602 × 10^(-10) J/GeV) = 4.806 × 10^(-22) kg/m³\n\nThe average velocity of WIMPs (v) is estimated to be around 220 km/s:\n\nv = 220 × 10^3 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the flux of WIMPs:\n\nΦ = ρ / (m_WIMP × v) = (4.806 × 10^(-22) kg/m³) / (1.78 × 10^(-25) kg × 220 × 10^3 m/s) = 1.22 × 10^7 m^(-2)s^(-1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction rate (R) with the detector:\n\nR = Φ × σ × M × t\n\nWhere M is the mass of the detector (100 kg) and t is the time interval (1 year).\n\nt = 1 year = 365.25 × 24 × 60 × 60 s = 3.1536 × 10^7 s\n\nR = (1.22 × 10^7 m^(-2)s^(-1)) × (10^(-40) m²) × (100 kg) × (3.1536 × 10^7 s) ≈ 3.85\n\nSo, approximately 3.85 WIMPs would pass through the detector during a time interval of 1 year. Since we cannot have a fraction of a particle, we can round this number to 4 WIMPs."
