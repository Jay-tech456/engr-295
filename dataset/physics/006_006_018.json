    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine structure splitting for the 3s-3p transition in atomic sodium, we need to consider the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment. This interaction is described by the hyperfine Hamiltonian:\n\nH_hf = A * I * J\n\nwhere A is the hyperfine coupling constant, I is the nuclear spin, and J is the total electronic angular momentum. For the 3s state, the total electronic angular momentum is J = L + S, where L is the orbital angular momentum and S is the electron spin. For the 3p state, we also have J = L + S.\n\nFor the 3s state, we have L = 0 (since it's an s orbital) and S = 1/2 (since sodium has one unpaired electron). Thus, J = 1/2 for the 3s state. For the 3p state, we have L = 1 (since it's a p orbital) and S = 1/2, which gives us two possible values for J: J = 1/2 and J = 3/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the hyperfine coupling constant A for both the 3s and 3p states. The hyperfine coupling constant can be determined experimentally or calculated using quantum mechanics. For sodium, the values are:\n\nA(3s) = 885.7 MHz\nA(3p) = 19.0 MHz\n\nNow we can calculate the energy shifts due to the hyperfine interaction for each state:\n\nΔE(3s) = A(3s) * I * J(3s) = 885.7 MHz * (3/2) * (1/2) = 664.275 MHz\nΔE(3p, J=1/2) = A(3p) * I * J(3p, J=1/2) = 19.0 MHz * (3/2) * (1/2) = 14.25 MHz\nΔE(3p, J=3/2) = A(3p) * I * J(3p, J=3/2) = 19.0 MHz * (3/2) * (3/2) = 42.75 MHz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the hyperfine structure splitting for the 3s-3p transition:\n\nΔE(3s-3p, J=1/2) = ΔE(3s) - ΔE(3p, J=1/2) = 664.275 MHz - 14.25 MHz = 650.025 MHz\nΔE(3s-3p, J=3/2) = ΔE(3s) - ΔE(3p, J=3/2) = 664.275 MHz - 42.75 MHz = 621.525 MHz\n\nSo, the hyperfine structure splitting for the 3s-3p transition in atomic sodium is 650.025 MHz and 621.525 MHz for the two possible values of J in the 3p state."
