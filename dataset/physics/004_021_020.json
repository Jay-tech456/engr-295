    "message_1": "What is the minimum mass that a star needs to have in order to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole according to the theory of general relativity? What is the formula to calculate this mass, and how does it relate to the Schwarzschild radius, which is the minimum radius a mass must have to form a black hole? How does the mass of the final black hole depend on the initial mass and other physical parameters of the collapsing star?",
    "message_2": "The minimum mass a star needs to have in order to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole is approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun, or roughly 3 solar masses. This value is derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing into a black hole. However, it is important to note that not all stars with masses above this limit will directly form black holes; they may undergo supernova explosions and lose mass before collapsing.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the minimum radius a mass must have to form a black hole. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light. The Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to the mass of the object, so as the mass increases, so does the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nThe mass of the final black hole depends on the initial mass of the collapsing star and the amount of mass it loses during the supernova explosion (if it occurs). In general, the more massive the initial star, the more massive the final black hole will be. However, the exact relationship between the initial mass and the final black hole mass depends on various factors, such as the star's composition, rotation, and magnetic fields. Additionally, the mass of the black hole can increase over time as it accretes matter from its surroundings."
