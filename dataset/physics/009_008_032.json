    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and orientation of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: m = -v/u\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = 20 cm\nObject distance (u) = -40 cm (negative sign indicates the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/20 = 1/(-40) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 40v to eliminate the fractions:\n\n2v = -v + 40v\n2v = 39v\n\nNow, divide by 39:\n\nv = -40 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is the real and inverted image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\n\nm = -v/u\nm = -(-40)/(-40)\nm = 1\n\nThe magnification is 1, which means the size of the image is the same as the size of the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is 40 cm in front of the mirror, the same size as the object, and inverted (upside-down)."
