    "message_2": "For a concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe focal length (f) of the mirror can be calculated using the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2\n\nIn this case, the radius of curvature (R) is 20 cm, so the focal length (f) is:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nSince the image is upright and of the same size as the object, the object distance (u) and the image distance (v) are equal. Let's call this distance x. We can now rewrite the mirror formula as:\n\n1/10 = 1/x + 1/x\n\nCombining the terms on the right side:\n\n1/10 = 2/x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 2 * 10 = 20 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the object and the mirror is 20 cm."
