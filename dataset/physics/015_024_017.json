    "message_1": "What is the expected amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses of 10 solar masses and 5 solar masses, at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n2. Amplitude (h): The amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the black holes, the distance to the system (D), and the inclination angle (ι) between the line of sight and the orbital plane. The formula for the amplitude is:\n\nh = (4 * G * M1 * M2 / (c^4 * D)) * (a / (1 + z))^(-1) * F(ι)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, z is the redshift, and F(ι) is a function of the inclination angle.\n\nHowever, we need more information to calculate the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system. Specifically, we need the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit and the inclination angle (ι) between the line of sight and the orbital plane. Additionally, the redshift (z) of the system would be needed to account for the expansion of the universe."
