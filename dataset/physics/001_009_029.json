The fundamental charge and Planck's constant are 1.6 x 10^-19 C and 6.626 x 10^-34 J s, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the Hall resistance, we first need to determine the Hall coefficient (R_H). The Hall coefficient is given by:\n\nR_H = 1/(q * n)\n\nwhere q is the fundamental charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C) and n is the electron density (1.5 x 10^11 per m^2).\n\nR_H = 1/(1.6 x 10^-19 C * 1.5 x 10^11 m^-2) ≈ 4.1667 x 10^-11 m^3/C\n\nNow, we can find the Hall resistance (R_Hall) using the formula:\n\nR_Hall = R_H * B / d\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field (5 T) and d is the width of the sample (1 cm = 0.01 m).\n\nR_Hall = (4.1667 x 10^-11 m^3/C) * (5 T) / (0.01 m) ≈ 2.0833 x 10^-8 T*m^2/C\n\nThe Hall resistance in the 2D electron gas is approximately 2.0833 x 10^-8 T*m^2/C."
