    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the laser light used in the Young's double-slit experiment, we can use the formula for the interference pattern of the double-slit experiment:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th maximum, m is the order of the maximum (m = 1 for the first maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nWe can also use the small angle approximation for tan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L, where y is the distance between the interference fringes on the screen and L is the distance from the slits to the screen. In this case, y = 2.0 mm and L = 2.5 m.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ y / L\nθ ≈ arctan(y / L)\n\nθ ≈ arctan(2.0 mm / 2.5 m) = arctan(0.002 / 2.5)\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nRearranging for λ:\n\nλ = (d * sin(θ)) / m\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = (0.25 mm * sin(arctan(0.002 / 2.5))) / 1\n\nλ ≈ (0.00025 m * sin(arctan(0.002 / 2.5))) / 1\n\nλ ≈ 6.4 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the laser light used in the Young's double-slit experiment is approximately 6.4 x 10^-7 m or 640 nm."
