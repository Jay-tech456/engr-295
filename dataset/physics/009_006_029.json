    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, the object distance (u) is -10 cm (negative because it's a real object) and the focal length (f) is -15 cm (negative because it's a concave mirror).\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-15) = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n1/v = 1/(-15) - 1/(-10)\n1/v = (-10 + 15) / (10 * 15)\n1/v = 5 / 150\nv = -30 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is -30 cm, which means the image is formed 30 cm in front of the mirror (real image).\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-30)/(-10)\nM = 30/10\nM = 3\n\nThe magnification is 3, which means the image is 3 times larger than the object.\n\nIn summary, the image is formed 30 cm in front of the mirror, it is a real and inverted image, and it is 3 times larger than the object."
