    "message_1": "A current-carrying helix has 200 turns, a diameter of 4 cm, and a length of 20 cm. The current through each turn is 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, which is at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the helix.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current through each turn.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of the helix\nn = 200 turns / 20 cm\nn = 200 turns / 0.2 m\nn = 1000 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B) inside the solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB = 8π × 10^(-4) T\n\nThe magnetic field inside the solenoid is uniform, so the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, which is at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the helix, is the same as the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB = 8π × 10^(-4) T ≈ 2.51 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the given point is approximately 2.51 × 10^(-3) T."
