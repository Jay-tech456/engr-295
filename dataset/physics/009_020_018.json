    "message_2": "To find the angle between the first-order diffraction maximum and the central maximum, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the diffraction maximum, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines on the grating, and θ is the angle between the diffraction maximum and the central maximum.\n\nGiven the spacing of 400 lines per mm, we can find the distance between the lines (d) as follows:\n\nd = 1 / (400 lines/mm) = 1 / 400 mm = 2.5 x 10^(-3) mm = 2.5 x 10^(-6) m\n\nThe wavelength of the laser beam (λ) is given as 633 nm, which can be converted to meters:\n\nλ = 633 nm = 633 x 10^(-9) m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the grating equation for the first-order diffraction maximum (n = 1):\n\n1 * (633 x 10^(-9) m) = (2.5 x 10^(-6) m) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (633 x 10^(-9) m) / (2.5 x 10^(-6) m) = 0.2532\n\nθ = arcsin(0.2532) ≈ 14.6 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the first-order diffraction maximum and the central maximum is approximately 14.6 degrees."
