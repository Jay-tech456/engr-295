    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force and lift force acting on the sphere, we need to use the following formulas:\n\nDrag force (FD) = 0.5 * CD * ρ * v² * A\nLift force (FL) = CL * 0.5 * ρ * v² * A\n\nwhere:\nCD is the drag coefficient (for a smooth sphere, CD ≈ 0.47)\nCL is the lift coefficient (for a sphere, CL ≈ 0)\nρ is the density of the fluid (glycerin in this case, ρ = 1250 kg/m³)\nv is the velocity of the sphere (v = 0.5 m/s)\nA is the cross-sectional area of the sphere (A = π * r²)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cross-sectional area of the sphere:\n\nA = π * r²\nA = π * (0.05 m)²\nA ≈ 0.00785 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force:\n\nFD = 0.5 * CD * ρ * v² * A\nFD = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1250 kg/m³ * (0.5 m/s)² * 0.00785 m²\nFD ≈ 0.729 N\n\nSince the lift coefficient (CL) for a sphere is approximately 0, the lift force (FL) will be negligible:\n\nFL = CL * 0.5 * ρ * v² * A\nFL = 0 * 0.5 * 1250 kg/m³ * (0.5 m/s)² * 0.00785 m²\nFL = 0 N\n\nSo, the drag force acting on the sphere is approximately 0.729 N, and the lift force is negligible (0 N)."
