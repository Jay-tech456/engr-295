    "message_2": "To determine the lifetime of the particle at rest and when it is moving, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation states that the time experienced by a moving object (proper time) is shorter than the time experienced by an observer at rest (coordinate time) relative to the moving object. The relationship between proper time (τ) and coordinate time (t) is given by the following equation:\n\nt = τ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the moving object and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the lifetime of the particle at rest (τ₀). Since the particle is at rest, there is no time dilation, so the proper time is equal to the coordinate time:\n\nτ₀ = t₀\n\nNow, we need to find the lifetime of the particle when it is moving (τ). We are given the speed of the particle (v = 0.8c) and its rest mass (m₀ = 500 MeV/c²). We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the total energy (E) of the particle:\n\nE² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the particle. Since we know the speed of the particle, we can find its momentum using the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = m₀v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\np = (500 MeV/c²)(0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\np ≈ 667.08 MeV/c\n\nNow, we can find the total energy (E) of the particle:\n\nE² = (500 MeV)² + (667.08 MeV)²\nE ≈ 832.50 MeV\n\nThe lifetime of the particle when it is moving (τ) is related to its rest lifetime (τ₀) and its total energy (E) by the following equation:\n\nτ = τ₀ * E / m₀c²\n\nWe are given the lifetime of the particle at rest (τ₀), so we can find the lifetime of the particle when it is moving (τ):\n\nτ = τ₀ * 832.50 MeV / 500 MeV\nτ = 1.665 * τ₀\n\nSo, the lifetime of the particle when it is moving is 1.665 times its lifetime at rest. To give a numerical answer, we would need to know the lifetime of the particle at rest (τ₀) in seconds."
