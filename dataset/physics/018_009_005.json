    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass, area, and entropy of a black hole can be described using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The entropy (S) of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area (A), and it can be expressed as:\n\nS = (kc^3 * A) / (4 * ħ * G)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe area of the event horizon (A) is related to the mass (M) of the black hole through the Schwarzschild radius (r_s):\n\nA = 4 * π * r_s^2\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius can be calculated using the mass of the black hole:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum amount of information that can be stored in a black hole of 1 solar mass (M = 1.989 * 10^30 kg).\n\n1. Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (r_s):\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\nr_s ≈ (2 * 6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg) / (3.0 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.95 * 10^3 m\n\n2. Calculate the area of the event horizon (A):\n\nA = 4 * π * r_s^2\nA ≈ 4 * π * (2.95 * 10^3 m)^2\nA ≈ 1.09 * 10^8 m^2\n\n3. Calculate the entropy (S):\n\nS = (kc^3 * A) / (4 * ħ * G)\nS ≈ (1.38 * 10^-23 J K^-1 * (3.0 * 10^8 m/s)^3 * 1.09 * 10^8 m^2) / (4 * 1.054 * 10^-34 J s * 6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nS ≈ 3.81 * 10^76 J K^-1\n\nThe entropy represents the maximum amount of information that can be stored in the black hole. To convert this to bits, we can use the relationship:\n\nInformation (in bits) = Entropy / (k * ln(2))\n\nInformation ≈ (3.81 * 10^76 J K^-1) / (1.38 * 10^-23 J K^-1 * ln(2))\nInformation ≈ 2.75 * 10^77 bits\n\nSo, the maximum amount of information that can be stored in a black hole of 1 solar mass is approximately 2.75 * 10^77 bits."
