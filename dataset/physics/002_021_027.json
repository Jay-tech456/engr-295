Calculate the fugacity of hydrogen in the mixture and determine if the gas mixture is ideal or non-ideal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of hydrogen in the mixture, we can use the following equation for an ideal gas mixture:\n\nfugacity (f_H2) = mole fraction (x_H2) * total pressure (P)\n\nGiven the mole fraction of hydrogen (x_H2) = 0.3 and the total pressure (P) = 2 atm, we can calculate the fugacity of hydrogen:\n\nf_H2 = 0.3 * 2 atm = 0.6 atm\n\nNow, to determine if the gas mixture is ideal or non-ideal, we can compare the fugacity coefficient (phi) of hydrogen in the mixture to that of an ideal gas. The fugacity coefficient for an ideal gas is 1.\n\nThe fugacity coefficient (phi) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nphi = fugacity (f_H2) / (mole fraction (x_H2) * partial pressure (P_H2))\n\nThe partial pressure of hydrogen (P_H2) can be calculated as:\n\nP_H2 = mole fraction (x_H2) * total pressure (P) = 0.3 * 2 atm = 0.6 atm\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity coefficient (phi):\n\nphi = 0.6 atm / (0.3 * 0.6 atm) = 1\n\nSince the fugacity coefficient (phi) is equal to 1, the gas mixture behaves as an ideal gas mixture."
