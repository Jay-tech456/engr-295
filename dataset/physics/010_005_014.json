    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force acting on the sphere, we can use the drag force equation:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * C_D * ρ * v^2 * A\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, C_D is the coefficient of drag (0.47), ρ is the fluid density (1.25 kg/m³), v is the velocity of the sphere (5 m/s), and A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere (0.1 m).\n\nA = π * (0.1)^2 = 0.0314 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1.25 * (5)^2 * 0.0314\nF_D = 0.235 * 1.25 * 25 * 0.0314\nF_D ≈ 2.31 N\n\nThe lift force acting on the sphere can be assumed to be negligible because spheres do not generate significant lift forces when moving through a fluid. The primary force acting on the sphere is the drag force, which we calculated to be approximately 2.31 N."
