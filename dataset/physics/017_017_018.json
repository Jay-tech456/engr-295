    "message_2": "The electronic and magnetic properties of surfaces and interfaces are influenced by temperature and external magnetic fields. In this investigation, we will consider a magnetic thin film on a non-magnetic substrate as our chosen material system.\n\nTheoretical Investigation:\n\n1. Temperature: As temperature increases, the thermal energy of the system also increases. This leads to an increase in the random motion of electrons, which in turn affects the magnetic properties of the material. The magnetic order of the material can be disrupted due to the increased thermal energy, leading to a decrease in magnetization. This phenomenon is known as the Curie-Weiss law, which states that the magnetization of a magnetic material decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes above a critical temperature known as the Curie temperature (Tc).\n\n2. External Magnetic Field: The application of an external magnetic field can affect the magnetic properties of the material by aligning the magnetic moments of the electrons in the direction of the applied field. This results in an increase in the overall magnetization of the material. The strength of the external magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility of the material determine the extent of this alignment.\n\nExperimental Investigation:\n\n1. Sample Preparation: A magnetic thin film (e.g., cobalt or iron) can be deposited on a non-magnetic substrate (e.g., silicon) using techniques such as sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy, or chemical vapor deposition. The thickness of the magnetic thin film can be controlled to study the effects of dimensionality on the magnetic properties.\n\n2. Temperature Dependence: The temperature dependence of the magnetic properties can be studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) or a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. By measuring the magnetization of the sample as a function of temperature, we can determine the Curie temperature and analyze the magnetic behavior of the material.\n\n3. Magnetic Field Dependence: The magnetic field dependence of the magnetic properties can be studied by applying an external magnetic field using an electromagnet or a superconducting magnet. The magnetization of the sample can be measured as a function of the applied magnetic field, and the magnetic hysteresis loops can be obtained. This data can be used to determine the coercivity, remanence, and saturation magnetization of the material.\n\n4. Electronic Properties: The electronic properties of the material system can be investigated using techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques can provide information about the electronic structure, band alignment, and density of states at the surface and interface of the material system.\n\nIn conclusion, the electronic and magnetic properties of surfaces and interfaces in a material system, such as a magnetic thin film on a non-magnetic substrate, can be significantly affected by temperature and external magnetic fields. Theoretical and experimental investigations can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and help in the development of novel materials and devices with tailored properties."
