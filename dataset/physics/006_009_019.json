    "message_2": "To find the change in wavelength of a photon that is Compton scattered, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ' is the wavelength of the scattered photon, λ is the wavelength of the incident photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial wavelength (λ) of the incident photon. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nRearranging for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nGiven the energy E = 50 keV = 50 * 10^3 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J (converting from keV to Joules)\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (50 * 10^3 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J)\nλ ≈ 2.479 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can use the Compton scattering formula to find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / [(9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)] * (1 - cos(60°))\nΔλ ≈ (2.426 x 10^-12 m) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ ≈ 1.213 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the change in wavelength of the photon that is Compton scattered is approximately 1.213 x 10^-12 m."
