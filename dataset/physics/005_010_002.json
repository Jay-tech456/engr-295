    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the beam of light appears to be coming from, as observed from the spaceship, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ)))\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the observed angle in the spaceship's frame\nθ is the angle in the star's frame (in this case, 0 degrees since the spaceship is moving directly towards the star)\nv is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the star (0.8c)\nc is the speed of light\nγ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(0) / (1.667(1 + (0.8c/c)cos(0))) = 0 / (1.667(1 + 0.8)) = 0 / (1.667 * 1.8)\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, the numerator is 0, and the whole expression becomes 0. This means that the observed angle θ' is also 0 degrees. Therefore, the beam of light from the star appears to be coming directly from the spaceship's direction of motion, as observed from the spaceship."
