    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave, we can use the following formulas:\n\nFrequency (f) = 1 / Period (T)\nWavelength (λ) = Velocity (v) / Frequency (f)\n\nGiven the velocity (v) of the sound wave is 340 m/s and the period (T) is 0.02 seconds, we can first calculate the frequency:\n\nFrequency (f) = 1 / 0.02 s = 50 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 340 m/s / 50 Hz = 6.8 m\n\nSo, the frequency of the sound wave is 50 Hz, and the wavelength is 6.8 meters.\n\nThe frequency of a sound wave is directly related to the pitch of the sound perceived by the human ear. Higher frequencies correspond to higher pitches, while lower frequencies correspond to lower pitches. The human ear can typically detect frequencies in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. In this case, the frequency of the sound wave is 50 Hz, which is on the lower end of the audible range, so the pitch of the sound would be perceived as relatively low."
