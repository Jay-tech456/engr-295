    "message_2": "A typical supernova explosion releases an enormous amount of energy, on the order of 10^44 joules (1 foe, where \"foe\" stands for ten to the power of 51 ergs). This energy is released in the form of light, neutrinos, and kinetic energy of the ejected material.\n\nTo compare this to the energy output of the Sun over its lifetime, we first need to estimate the Sun's total energy output. The Sun's luminosity, or the rate at which it emits energy, is about 3.8 x 10^26 watts (joules per second). The Sun's lifetime is approximately 10 billion years (10^10 years) or about 3.1536 x 10^17 seconds.\n\nTo calculate the total energy output of the Sun over its lifetime, we multiply its luminosity by its lifetime:\n\nTotal energy output = Luminosity × Lifetime\nTotal energy output = (3.8 x 10^26 watts) × (3.1536 x 10^17 seconds)\nTotal energy output ≈ 1.2 x 10^44 joules\n\nComparing the energy released during a typical supernova explosion (10^44 joules) to the energy output of the Sun over its lifetime (1.2 x 10^44 joules), we can see that they are roughly of the same order of magnitude. However, it's important to note that a supernova explosion releases this energy in a very short period of time (days to weeks), while the Sun emits its energy over billions of years."
