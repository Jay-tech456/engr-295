    "message_2": "The largest known structure in the universe is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall (Her-CrB GW). It is a massive galactic supercluster structure that spans approximately 10 billion light-years across. This immense structure consists of several galaxy clusters and superclusters connected by vast cosmic filaments.\n\nThe presence of such large-scale structures affects the distribution of galaxies on a larger scale by influencing the overall cosmic web. The cosmic web is a complex network of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids that make up the large-scale structure of the universe. The gravitational forces between these structures cause galaxies to be distributed unevenly throughout the universe, with higher concentrations in clusters and filaments and lower concentrations in voids.\n\nIn addition, the distribution of galaxies is also influenced by the process of hierarchical clustering, where smaller structures merge to form larger ones over time. This process is driven by the gravitational attraction between galaxies and dark matter, which makes up the majority of the mass in the universe. As a result, the presence of massive structures like the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall plays a significant role in shaping the overall distribution of galaxies in the universe."
