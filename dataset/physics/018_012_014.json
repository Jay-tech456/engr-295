    "message_2": "The source of ultra-high-energy gamma rays observed by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) in the Milky Way galaxy is primarily from supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and active galactic nuclei.\n\n1. Supernova remnants: When a massive star reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a supernova explosion, ejecting its outer layers into the surrounding interstellar medium. The shock waves from these explosions can accelerate charged particles, such as protons and electrons, to extremely high energies. These accelerated particles can then interact with surrounding gas and radiation fields, producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays through processes like neutral pion decay and inverse Compton scattering.\n\n2. Pulsar wind nebulae: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. They are formed during supernova explosions and are often found at the centers of supernova remnants. Pulsars generate strong winds of charged particles, which can interact with the surrounding magnetic fields and create a pulsar wind nebula. In these nebulae, electrons and positrons are accelerated to ultra-high energies, producing gamma rays through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering.\n\n3. Active galactic nuclei: These are the central regions of galaxies that exhibit unusually high levels of electromagnetic radiation, often powered by supermassive black holes. In the vicinity of these black holes, charged particles can be accelerated to ultra-high energies through various processes, such as magnetic reconnection and shock acceleration. These particles can then produce gamma rays through interactions with surrounding gas, radiation fields, or other particles.\n\nIn summary, ultra-high-energy gamma rays observed by HAWC in the Milky Way galaxy are produced by the interaction of accelerated charged particles with their surrounding environments in astrophysical sources like supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and active galactic nuclei."
