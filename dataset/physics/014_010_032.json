    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius is a measure of the size of the event horizon of a black hole. It is the distance from the center of a black hole at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. In other words, it is the point of no return, beyond which anything that enters, including light, cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The concept of the event horizon is directly related to the Schwarzschild radius, as the event horizon is the boundary that marks the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass equivalent to 3 times that of the sun, we first need to know the mass of the sun (Msun), which is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is 3Msun, or 5.967 x 10^30 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)(5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 8.856 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass equivalent to 3 times that of the sun is approximately 8,856 meters or 8.856 kilometers."
