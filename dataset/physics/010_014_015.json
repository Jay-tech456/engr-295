    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying at Mach 2.5 at an altitude of 10,000 meters. At a certain point in time, the aircraft encounters a shock wave which causes the temperature to rise by 200 K. Calculate the velocity of the shockwave in meters per second.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of sound at the given altitude and then use the Mach number to find the velocity of the aircraft. Next, we will use the normal shock relations to find the velocity of the shock wave.\n\nFirst, let's find the speed of sound at 10,000 meters. The temperature at this altitude can be approximated as T = 223 K (from the standard atmosphere model). The speed of sound (a) in air can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = sqrt(γ * R * T)\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the specific heat ratio for air (1.4), R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\na = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 223)\na ≈ 295.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the velocity of the aircraft (v) using the Mach number (M):\n\nv = M * a\nv = 2.5 * 295.5\nv ≈ 738.75 m/s\n\nNext, we will use the normal shock relations to find the velocity of the shock wave. The normal shock relations for the Mach number downstream of the shock (M2) can be found using the formula:\n\nM2^2 = ((γ - 1) * M1^2 + 2) / (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1))\n\nwhere M1 is the Mach number upstream of the shock (2.5).\n\nM2^2 = ((1.4 - 1) * 2.5^2 + 2) / (2 * 1.4 * 2.5^2 - (1.4 - 1))\nM2^2 ≈ 0.5773\nM2 ≈ 0.76\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the velocities across the shock wave using the formula:\n\nv2 / v1 = M1 / M2\n\nv2 / 738.75 = 2.5 / 0.76\nv2 ≈ 233.4 m/s\n\nSince the temperature increased by 200 K due to the shock wave, we can find the new temperature (T2):\n\nT2 = T1 + 200\nT2 = 223 + 200\nT2 = 423 K\n\nNow, we can find the speed of sound downstream of the shock (a2) using the formula:\n\na2 = sqrt(γ * R * T2)\na2 = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 423)\na2 ≈ 362.6 m/s\n\nFinally, we can find the velocity of the shock wave (Vs) using the relation:\n\nVs = a2 * M2\nVs = 362.6 * 0.76\nVs ≈ 275.6 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the shock wave is approximately 275.6 meters per second."
