    "message_1": "A refrigerator operates between 0℃ and 30℃ and consumes 150 J of work to remove 500 J of heat from the inside of the refrigerator. Determine the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the inside (Q_cold) to the work input (W) required to operate the refrigerator. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_cold / W\n\nGiven that the refrigerator consumes 150 J of work (W) to remove 500 J of heat (Q_cold) from the inside, we can calculate the COP as follows:\n\nCOP = 500 J / 150 J\n\nCOP = 3.33\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is 3.33."
