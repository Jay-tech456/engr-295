    "message_2": "The detection of axions, hypothetical elementary particles that are candidates for dark matter, can be improved by integrating cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and high-mobility materials. This can be achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. Enhancing the coupling between axions and photons: The interaction between axions and photons can be enhanced by utilizing cQED, which deals with the interaction between light and matter in confined spaces. By confining the electromagnetic field in a high-quality factor (Q) resonant cavity, the probability of axion-photon conversion can be increased. This can lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio, making it easier to detect axions.\n\n2. Utilizing high-mobility materials: High-mobility materials, such as graphene and topological insulators, have low electrical resistance and can support high-frequency currents with minimal energy loss. These materials can be used to create highly sensitive detectors for axions. By integrating these materials into the resonant cavity, the sensitivity of the axion detection setup can be significantly improved.\n\n3. Exploiting quantum coherence: Quantum coherence can be used to enhance the axion detection process. By preparing the cavity in a coherent state, the quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field can be minimized, leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. This can be achieved by using techniques such as squeezed states and entangled states in the cQED setup.\n\n4. Tuning the resonant frequency: The resonant frequency of the cavity can be tuned to match the expected axion mass, which is crucial for axion-photon conversion. This can be done by using high-mobility materials with tunable properties, such as graphene, which can be easily tuned by applying an external voltage.\n\n5. Increasing the cavity volume: The probability of axion-photon conversion is proportional to the cavity volume. By increasing the cavity volume, the chances of detecting axions can be improved. This can be achieved by using high-mobility materials with large surface areas, such as two-dimensional materials like graphene.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of cavity quantum electrodynamics and high-mobility materials can lead to significant improvements in axion detection. By enhancing the coupling between axions and photons, utilizing high-mobility materials, exploiting quantum coherence, tuning the resonant frequency, and increasing the cavity volume, the sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of axion detection setups can be significantly improved. This could potentially lead to the discovery of axions and a better understanding of dark matter."
