    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sinθ1 = n2 * sinθ2\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (glass and air), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 (refractive index of glass) = 1.5, n2 (refractive index of air) = 1, and θ1 (angle of incidence) = 60 degrees. We want to find θ2 (angle of refraction).\n\n1.5 * sin(60) = 1 * sinθ2\n\nsin(60) = √3/2, so:\n\n1.5 * (√3/2) = sinθ2\n\nsinθ2 = 1.5 * √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides to find θ2:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(1.5 * √3/2)\n\nθ2 ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 41.81 degrees."
