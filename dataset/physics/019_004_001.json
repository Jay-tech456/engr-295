    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons using quantum field theory at the leading order of perturbation theory, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant interaction: In this case, the relevant interaction is the annihilation of an electron (e-) and a positron (e+) into a virtual photon (γ*), which then decays into a quark-antiquark pair (q and q̅). The quark-antiquark pair then hadronizes into the final state hadrons.\n\n2. Write down the Feynman diagrams: For this process, there are two Feynman diagrams at the leading order. One diagram has the electron and positron annihilating into a virtual photon, which then decays into a quark-antiquark pair. The other diagram is similar but with the quark and antiquark having their positions exchanged.\n\n3. Calculate the matrix element: Using the Feynman rules for QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) and QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), calculate the matrix element for the process. The matrix element is the amplitude for the process to occur, and it is related to the probability of the process.\n\n4. Square the matrix element: To obtain the probability of the process, we need to square the matrix element and sum over all possible final states (i.e., all possible quark-antiquark pairs). This will give us the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ, where Ω is the solid angle.\n\n5. Integrate over phase space: To obtain the total cross-section, integrate the differential cross-section over the entire phase space of the final state particles. This involves integrating over all possible angles and energies of the final state particles, subject to conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n6. Include the hadronization process: The cross-section calculated so far is for the production of quark-antiquark pairs. To obtain the cross-section for the production of hadrons, we need to include the hadronization process. This is typically done using phenomenological models or Monte Carlo simulations, which take into account the non-perturbative aspects of QCD.\n\nThe final result will be the total cross-section for electron-positron annihilation into hadrons at the leading order of perturbation theory. Note that higher-order corrections can be included by considering more complicated Feynman diagrams and calculating the corresponding matrix elements. However, this quickly becomes more challenging as the number of diagrams and the complexity of the calculations increase."
