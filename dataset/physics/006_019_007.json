    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of an X-ray photon with a given wavelength, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\n0.2 nm = 0.2 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.2 x 10^-9 m)\n\nE = 9.939 x 10^-16 J\n\nThe energy required to produce an X-ray with a wavelength of 0.2 nm when an electron is excited from the K-shell to the L-shell in a copper atom is approximately 9.939 x 10^-16 Joules."
