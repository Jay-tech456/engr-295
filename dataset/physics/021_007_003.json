    "message_2": "The effect of a passing star on the trajectory of a black hole can be understood through the principles of gravitational interaction between celestial bodies. When a star passes close to a black hole, both objects exert a gravitational force on each other, which can alter their trajectories. This interaction can be described using Newton's law of universal gravitation and the principles of orbital mechanics.\n\nThe mass and velocity of the passing star play significant roles in determining the extent of the effect on the black hole's trajectory and gravitational pull. The gravitational force between the star and the black hole is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Therefore, a more massive star will have a greater effect on the black hole's trajectory due to the stronger gravitational force.\n\nThe velocity of the passing star also influences the interaction. If the star is moving at a high velocity, it will spend less time in the vicinity of the black hole, reducing the duration of the gravitational interaction. This may result in a less significant change in the black hole's trajectory. Conversely, if the star is moving slowly, the gravitational interaction will last longer, potentially causing a more significant change in the black hole's trajectory.\n\nIt is important to note that the black hole's gravitational pull itself does not change, as it is determined by its mass and the distance from the black hole. However, the trajectory of objects affected by the black hole's gravity may change due to the altered motion of the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the effect of a passing star on the trajectory of a black hole depends on the mass and velocity of the star. A more massive and slower-moving star will have a greater impact on the black hole's trajectory due to the stronger and longer-lasting gravitational interaction. However, the black hole's gravitational pull itself does not change; only the motion of objects influenced by its gravity may be affected."
