Using the thin lens equation, calculate the image distance, image height, and magnification.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the thin lens equation and the magnification formula.\n\nThe thin lens equation is given by:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo find di, we can first subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n1/10 - 1/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n(3 - 1) / 30 = 1/di\n2/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for di:\ndi = 30/2\ndi = 15 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can determine the magnification using the formula:\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -15/30\nM = -0.5\n\nSince the magnification is negative, the image is inverted. The magnification value of 0.5 means the image is half the size of the object.\n\nTo find the image height, we can use the magnification formula relating object height (ho) and image height (hi):\nM = hi/ho\n\nIf we assume an object height (ho) of, say, 10 cm, we can find the image height (hi):\n-0.5 = hi/10\n\nhi = -0.5 * 10\nhi = -5 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed at a distance of 15 cm from the lens, it is inverted, and its height is 5 cm, which is half the size of the object. The magnification is -0.5."
