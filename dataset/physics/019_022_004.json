    "message_2": "The holographic duality, also known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, is a conjectured relationship between a higher-dimensional gravity theory (specifically, a string theory or M-theory) in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and a lower-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) defined on the boundary of that space, which is a conformal field theory (CFT). This duality provides a powerful tool for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories and has applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and quantum gravity.\n\nTo compute holographic dualities in the context of quantum field theory, several techniques and tools are employed:\n\n1. Large N expansion: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the duality often involves a gauge theory with a large number of colors (N). The large N expansion allows for a systematic approximation of the strongly coupled gauge theory by treating 1/N as a small parameter. This expansion simplifies the calculations and makes the duality more tractable.\n\n2. Supergravity approximation: In the regime where the string coupling is small, the higher-dimensional gravity theory can be approximated by classical supergravity. This approximation simplifies the calculations on the gravity side of the duality and allows for the computation of correlation functions and other observables in the dual CFT.\n\n3. Witten diagrams: These are Feynman-like diagrams used to compute correlation functions in the AdS space. Witten diagrams provide a graphical representation of the calculations in the gravity theory and can be translated into corresponding expressions in the dual CFT.\n\n4. Holographic renormalization: This is a systematic procedure to compute renormalized correlation functions in the dual CFT from the bulk supergravity fields. It involves adding counterterms to the on-shell supergravity action to remove divergences arising from the boundary of the AdS space.\n\n5. Integrability: In some cases, the AdS/CFT correspondence involves integrable models, which are exactly solvable. Integrability techniques, such as the Bethe ansatz and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, can be used to compute observables in the dual CFT exactly.\n\n6. Numerical methods: In situations where analytical methods are not applicable, numerical techniques, such as lattice gauge theory simulations and Monte Carlo methods, can be employed to study the strongly coupled quantum field theories and their holographic duals.\n\nThese techniques and tools, along with others, have been used to compute various observables in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, such as correlation functions, entanglement entropy, and transport coefficients. The holographic duality has proven to be a powerful framework for understanding the non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories and continues to be an active area of research in theoretical physics."
