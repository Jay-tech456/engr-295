    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the lowest Landau level in a 2D electron gas subjected to a magnetic field of strength B, we need to consider the degeneracy of the Landau levels.\n\nThe degeneracy of a Landau level is given by the number of available quantum states per unit area, which is related to the magnetic field strength. The degeneracy per unit area is given by:\n\ng = B / (h / e)\n\nwhere g is the degeneracy per unit area, B is the magnetic field strength, h is the Planck's constant, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nNow, let's consider a 2D electron gas of area A. The total number of available quantum states in the lowest Landau level is given by the product of the degeneracy per unit area and the area:\n\nN = g * A\n\nSubstituting the expression for g, we get:\n\nN = (B / (h / e)) * A\n\nN = (B * A * e) / h\n\nThe maximum number of electrons that can occupy the lowest Landau level is equal to the total number of available quantum states in that level, which is N. So, the maximum number of electrons is given by:\n\nN_max = (B * A * e) / h"
