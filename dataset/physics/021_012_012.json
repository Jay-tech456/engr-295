    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a rotating black hole using the Penrose process is approximately 29% of the black hole's mass energy. This value is derived from the black hole's angular momentum and mass, and it is achieved when the black hole is maximally rotating, i.e., when its angular momentum is at its highest possible value for a given mass.\n\nTo achieve this maximum conversion efficiency, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The black hole must be rotating: The Penrose process relies on the extraction of energy from the rotational energy of the black hole. Therefore, a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole would not allow for energy extraction through this process.\n\n2. The particle must enter the ergosphere: The Penrose process occurs in the ergosphere, a region outside the event horizon where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime along with it. A particle entering this region can interact with the black hole's rotational energy.\n\n3. The particle must split into two: Once inside the ergosphere, the incoming particle must split into two particles. One of these particles falls into the black hole, while the other escapes to infinity.\n\n4. The escaping particle must have a higher energy than the initial particle: The energy extraction occurs when the escaping particle has more energy than the initial particle. This energy gain comes at the expense of the black hole's rotational energy, effectively slowing down the black hole.\n\nBy satisfying these conditions, the Penrose process can extract up to 29% of the black hole's mass energy. However, it is important to note that this is a theoretical maximum, and in practice, the efficiency of energy extraction may be lower due to various factors such as the specific trajectories of particles and the presence of an accretion disk around the black hole."
