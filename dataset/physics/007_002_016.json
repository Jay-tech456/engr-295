    "message_1": "A sample of Uranium-238 has an initial activity of 300 Bq. If the half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.47 billion years, what will be its activity after 9 billion years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere Activity_final is the activity after 9 billion years, Activity_initial is the initial activity (300 Bq), time_elapsed is the time that has passed (9 billion years), and half_life is the half-life of Uranium-238 (4.47 billion years).\n\nActivity_final = 300 Bq * (1/2)^(9 billion years / 4.47 billion years)\n\nNow, we can calculate the exponent:\n\nExponent = 9 billion years / 4.47 billion years = 2.014\n\nActivity_final = 300 Bq * (1/2)^2.014\n\nActivity_final ≈ 300 Bq * 0.242\n\nActivity_final ≈ 72.6 Bq\n\nAfter 9 billion years, the activity of the Uranium-238 sample will be approximately 72.6 Bq."
