    "message_1": "A sphere of radius 5 cm is carrying a current of 2.5 A. What is the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere? (Assume that the permeability of free space is 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere, we can simplify the problem by treating the sphere as a magnetic dipole.\n\nThe magnetic moment (m) of the sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = I * A\n\nwhere I is the current (2.5 A) and A is the surface area of the sphere.\n\nThe surface area of the sphere (A) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = 4πr²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere (5 cm or 0.05 m).\n\nA = 4π(0.05)² ≈ 0.0314 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment (m):\n\nm = 2.5 A * 0.0314 m² ≈ 0.0785 Am²\n\nNext, we can calculate the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from the center of the sphere using the formula for the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (m / r³)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), m is the magnetic moment, and r is the distance from the center of the sphere (10 cm or 0.1 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (0.0785 Am² / (0.1 m)³) ≈ 9.96 × 10⁻⁸ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 9.96 × 10⁻⁸ T."
