Given that the wavelength of the line is 656.3 nm and the Landé factor for the transition is 3/2. What is the energy difference between the Zeeman sublevels and what is the splitting of the spectral line produced by the magnetic field?",
    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of a magnetic field. To calculate the energy difference between the Zeeman sublevels and the splitting of the spectral line, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔE = g * μ_B * B * Δm\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the sublevels, g is the Landé factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength, and Δm is the difference in magnetic quantum numbers between the sublevels.\n\nGiven the Landé factor g = 3/2 and the magnetic field strength B = 0.5 T, we can calculate the energy difference for Δm = ±1:\n\nΔE = (3/2) * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * 0.5 T * 1\nΔE = 6.9555 x 10^-24 J\n\nNow, we can find the splitting of the spectral line in terms of wavelength. We know that the energy of a photon is given by:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the change in wavelength (Δλ):\n\nΔλ = h * c * Δm / (g * μ_B * B * λ)\n\nPlugging in the given values for the Balmer-Alpha line (λ = 656.3 nm = 656.3 x 10^-9 m) and the calculated energy difference:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) * 1 / ((3/2) * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * 0.5 T * 656.3 x 10^-9 m)\nΔλ = 1.989 x 10^-15 m\n\nTo convert this value back to nanometers:\n\nΔλ = 1.989 x 10^-15 m * (1 x 10^9 nm/m) = 1.989 x 10^-6 nm\n\nSo, the energy difference between the Zeeman sublevels is 6.9555 x 10^-24 J, and the splitting of the spectral line produced by the magnetic field is approximately 1.989 x 10^-6 nm."
