    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the fugacity of an ideal gas at a specific temperature and pressure. The gas has a molar mass of 32g/mol and its equation of state is PV=nRT. The student has a sample of 0.5 moles of the gas in a container of volume 2L. The temperature of the container is 273K and the pressure inside is 2 atm. Calculate the fugacity of the gas.",
    "message_2": "For an ideal gas, the fugacity (f) is equal to its pressure (P). In this case, the pressure inside the container is given as 2 atm. Therefore, the fugacity of the gas is:\n\nf = P\nf = 2 atm\n\nThe fugacity of the ideal gas in this scenario is 2 atm."
