    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a charged W boson, and subsequently, the W boson decaying into an electron and an electron antineutrino, we need to consider the branching ratios of the respective decays.\n\n1. The top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a charged W boson:\nThe top quark almost always decays into a bottom quark and a W boson. The branching ratio for this decay is approximately 100%.\n\n2. The W boson decaying into an electron and an electron antineutrino:\nThe W boson can decay into three different lepton-neutrino pairs: electron-electron antineutrino, muon-muon antineutrino, and tau-tau antineutrino. The branching ratio for each of these decays is approximately 1/3 or 33.3%.\n\nTo find the overall probability, we multiply the branching ratios of the two decays:\n\nProbability = (Branching ratio of top quark decay) × (Branching ratio of W boson decay)\nProbability = (1.0) × (1/3)\nProbability ≈ 0.333 or 33.3%\n\nSo, the probability of a produced top quark in a high-energy proton-proton collision decaying into a bottom quark and a charged W boson, and subsequently, the W boson decaying into an electron and an electron antineutrino is approximately 33.3%."
