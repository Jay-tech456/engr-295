    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron neutrino (νe) oscillating into a muon (νμ) or tau neutrino (ντ) after traveling a distance of 500 km in vacuum, we need to consider neutrino oscillation probabilities. Neutrino oscillation probabilities depend on the mixing angles (θ12, θ23, and θ13), the mass-squared differences (Δm^2), the initial energy of the neutrino (E), and the distance traveled (L).\n\nThe probability of an electron neutrino oscillating into a muon or tau neutrino can be expressed as:\n\nP(νe → νμ or ντ) = 1 - P(νe → νe)\n\nThe probability of an electron neutrino remaining as an electron neutrino is given by:\n\nP(νe → νe) = 1 - 4 * [(sin^2(θ13) * (1 - sin^2(θ13))) * sin^2(Δm^2_31 * L / (4E)) + (cos^2(θ13) * sin^2(θ12) * (1 - cos^2(θ13) * sin^2(θ12))) * sin^2(Δm^2_21 * L / (4E))]\n\nHere, Δm^2_31 and Δm^2_21 are the mass-squared differences between the neutrino mass eigenstates, and L is the distance traveled in natural units (L = 500 km * 1.97 * 10^-4 eV^(-1)).\n\nTo calculate the probability, we need the values of the mixing angles and mass-squared differences. The current best-fit values from global neutrino oscillation data are:\n\nθ12 ≈ 33.82°\nθ23 ≈ 48.3°\nθ13 ≈ 8.61°\nΔm^2_21 ≈ 7.39 * 10^(-5) eV^2\nΔm^2_31 ≈ 2.523 * 10^(-3) eV^2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equations above to calculate the probability of an electron neutrino oscillating into a muon or tau neutrino after traveling 500 km in vacuum for a given initial energy E.\n\nKeep in mind that the probability will depend on the initial energy of the neutrino, so you would need to specify a value for E to obtain a numerical result."
