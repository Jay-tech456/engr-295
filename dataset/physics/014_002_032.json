    "message_2": "The estimated age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. Scientists arrived at this calculation through several methods, including the study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the expansion rate of the universe, and the observation of distant objects.\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the residual radiation from the Big Bang, which has cooled down over time and is now observed as a nearly uniform glow of microwave radiation across the entire sky. By studying the temperature fluctuations in the CMB and fitting them to a theoretical model, scientists can estimate the age of the universe. This method is considered one of the most accurate ways to determine the age of the universe.\n\n2. Expansion Rate of the Universe: The universe is expanding, and by measuring the rate of this expansion, scientists can estimate its age. This is done using the Hubble constant, which relates the speed at which galaxies are moving away from us to their distance. By determining the Hubble constant and assuming a constant rate of expansion, scientists can estimate the age of the universe.\n\n3. Observation of Distant Objects: By observing the oldest and most distant objects in the universe, such as ancient galaxies and quasars, scientists can estimate the age of the universe. The light from these objects has taken billions of years to reach us, so their age provides a lower limit for the age of the universe.\n\nThese methods, along with other observations and theoretical models, have led scientists to the current estimate of the universe's age at around 13.8 billion years."
