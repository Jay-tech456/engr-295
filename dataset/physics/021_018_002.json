    "message_2": "The gravitational lensing phenomena observed around a black hole is primarily influenced by its mass and, to a lesser extent, its shape (or more precisely, its angular momentum or spin). Let's discuss how each of these factors affects gravitational lensing.\n\n1. Mass: The mass of a black hole determines the strength of its gravitational field. According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, a massive object like a black hole warps the spacetime around it. This curvature of spacetime causes light to follow a curved path when passing near the black hole. The more massive the black hole, the stronger the gravitational field and the more pronounced the lensing effect. This results in a larger bending angle of light and a more noticeable distortion of the background objects.\n\n2. Shape (Angular Momentum/Spin): Real black holes are not perfect spheres but are slightly oblate due to their rotation. The rotation of a black hole is characterized by its angular momentum or spin, which ranges from 0 (non-rotating) to 1 (maximally rotating). The spin of a black hole affects the spacetime geometry around it, which in turn influences the gravitational lensing phenomena.\n\nA rotating black hole drags the spacetime around it, a phenomenon known as frame-dragging or the Lense-Thirring effect. This effect causes the light rays to experience an additional twisting motion as they pass near the black hole. The degree of this twisting depends on the black hole's spin, with a higher spin leading to a more pronounced effect.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a black hole has a more significant impact on the gravitational lensing phenomena, as it determines the strength of the gravitational field and the amount of spacetime curvature. The shape, or more specifically, the spin of a black hole, also affects lensing by introducing additional twisting of light rays due to frame-dragging. Both factors contribute to the overall distortion and bending of light observed around a black hole."
