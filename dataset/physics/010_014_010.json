    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure increase ahead of the shock wave, we need to use the normal shock relations for a compressible flow. The normal shock relations are derived from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy equations across the shock wave. For a given Mach number M1 (upstream of the shock wave), we can find the pressure ratio (P2/P1) across the shock wave using the following formula:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * γ * (M1^2 - 1)) / (γ + 1)\n\nwhere P1 is the pressure upstream of the shock wave, P2 is the pressure downstream of the shock wave, γ is the specific heat ratio (1.4 for air), and M1 is the Mach number upstream of the shock wave.\n\nGiven that the aircraft flies at Mach 3.5, we have:\n\nM1 = 3.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure ratio:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * 1.4 * (3.5^2 - 1)) / (1.4 + 1)\nP2/P1 ≈ 9.097\n\nTo find the pressure increase (ΔP), we need to find the pressure upstream of the shock wave (P1). We can use the standard atmospheric model to find the pressure at an altitude of 15,000 meters. The pressure at sea level (P0) is 101325 Pa, and the temperature at sea level (T0) is 288.15 K. The temperature lapse rate (L) is -0.0065 K/m, and the gas constant for air (R) is 287 J/(kg·K). The specific heat ratio (γ) is 1.4. Using the barometric formula, we can find the pressure at 15,000 meters:\n\nP1 = P0 * (1 + (L * h) / T0)^(-g * M / (R * L))\nP1 = 101325 * (1 - 0.0065 * 15000 / 288.15)^(-9.81 * 0.029 / (287 * -0.0065))\nP1 ≈ 12139.6 Pa\n\nNow, we can find the pressure downstream of the shock wave (P2):\n\nP2 = P1 * (P2/P1)\nP2 ≈ 12139.6 * 9.097\nP2 ≈ 110419.3 Pa\n\nFinally, we can find the pressure increase (ΔP):\n\nΔP = P2 - P1\nΔP ≈ 110419.3 - 12139.6\nΔP ≈ 98279.7 Pa\n\nSo, the pressure increase ahead of the shock wave is approximately 98,279.7 Pa."
