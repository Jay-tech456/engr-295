    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a₀) of a hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_eZe²)\n\nwhere:\nε₀ = vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/Nm²)\nħ = reduced Planck constant (1.055 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e = electron mass (9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\nZ = atomic number (1 for hydrogen)\ne = elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na₀ = (4π(8.854 x 10^-12)(1.055 x 10^-34)²) / ((9.11 x 10^-31)(1)(1.602 x 10^-19)²)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291772 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291772 x 10^-11 meters."
