    "message_2": "Cooper pairs are formed in superconducting materials when two electrons with opposite spins and momenta are attracted to each other through an interaction mediated by lattice vibrations, known as phonons. This attractive interaction overcomes the natural repulsion between electrons due to their negative charges, allowing them to form a bound state known as a Cooper pair.\n\nThe formation of Cooper pairs is a direct result of the material being cooled below its critical temperature (Tc), which is the temperature at which a material transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state. When the temperature is lowered below Tc, the attractive interaction between electrons becomes stronger, and the formation of Cooper pairs becomes energetically favorable.\n\nCooper pairs contribute to the phenomenon of zero electrical resistance in superconducting materials through a process called Bose-Einstein condensation. In this process, the Cooper pairs, which are considered to be composite bosons, condense into a single quantum state known as the superconducting state. In this state, the Cooper pairs move coherently through the material without any scattering or energy loss, resulting in zero electrical resistance.\n\nThe absence of resistance in superconducting materials is due to the fact that the energy gap between the superconducting state and the normal conducting state is large enough to prevent any single electron from breaking a Cooper pair and entering the normal state. This energy gap acts as an energy barrier that prevents any energy dissipation through electron scattering, which is the primary cause of electrical resistance in normal conductors.\n\nIn summary, Cooper pairs form in superconducting materials when electrons with opposite spins and momenta are attracted to each other through phonon-mediated interactions. These pairs then condense into a single quantum state, allowing them to move coherently through the material without any energy loss, resulting in zero electrical resistance."
