    "message_1": "A toroid has a mean radius of 10 cm, an outer radius of 15 cm and 350 turns of wire. If a current of 3 A is flowing through the toroid, what is the magnetic field inside the toroid along the axis?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field inside the toroid along the axis, we can use Ampere's law. The magnetic field B inside the toroid can be expressed as:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nN = 350 turns (number of turns of wire)\nI = 3 A (current flowing through the toroid)\nR = 0.1 m (mean radius of the toroid, converted from 10 cm to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 350 * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 350 * 3) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nB = (4.2 × 10^(-4) T) / 0.2\n\nB = 2.1 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the toroid along the axis is 2.1 × 10^(-3) T (Tesla)."
