    "message_2": "The critical energy required to initiate nuclear fusion in deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuel is often referred to as the ignition temperature or the energy needed for the fuel to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. For D-T fusion, this ignition temperature is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK) or 8.6 keV (kilo-electron volts) in terms of energy.\n\nAt this temperature, the kinetic energy of the deuterium and tritium nuclei is high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier, allowing them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion. This is the minimum energy required for self-sustaining fusion reactions to occur, where the energy produced by the fusion reactions is enough to maintain the plasma temperature and continue the fusion process without external heating."
