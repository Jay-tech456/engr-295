    "message_2": "The energy yield per glucose molecule oxidized through the glycolytic pathway and citric acid cycle can be calculated by considering the number of ATP molecules produced at different stages of these processes. Here's a breakdown of ATP production:\n\n1. Glycolysis:\n- Net production of 2 ATP molecules (substrate-level phosphorylation)\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced, which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain (ETC). So, 2 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH = 6 ATP\n\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation (conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA):\n- 2 NADH molecules are produced (1 per pyruvate, and there are 2 pyruvates per glucose), which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation in the ETC. So, 2 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH = 6 ATP\n\n3. Citric acid cycle (also known as Krebs cycle or TCA cycle):\n- 2 ATP molecules are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation (1 per cycle, and there are 2 cycles per glucose)\n- 6 NADH molecules are produced (3 per cycle), which can generate 3 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation in the ETC. So, 6 NADH x 3 ATP/NADH = 18 ATP\n- 2 FADH2 molecules are produced (1 per cycle), which can generate 2 ATP molecules each through oxidative phosphorylation in the ETC. So, 2 FADH2 x 2 ATP/FADH2 = 4 ATP\n\nAdding up the ATP molecules produced at each stage:\n2 ATP (glycolysis) + 6 ATP (glycolysis NADH) + 6 ATP (pyruvate decarboxylation NADH) + 2 ATP (citric acid cycle) + 18 ATP (citric acid cycle NADH) + 4 ATP (citric acid cycle FADH2) = 38 ATP\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in eukaryotic cells, the transport of NADH produced during glycolysis into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation consumes 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, the net ATP production in eukaryotic cells is 36 ATP molecules per glucose.\n\nAs for the energy needed to synthesize ATP molecules, the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule (converting ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate) releases approximately 7.3 kcal/mol (30.6 kJ/mol) of energy. This energy is used to drive various cellular processes, including the synthesis of new ATP molecules. The energy required to synthesize one ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic phosphate is roughly equal to the energy released during ATP hydrolysis, which is around 7.3 kcal/mol (30.6 kJ/mol)."
