(Assuming time dilation in a moving frame of reference according to the theory of special relativity).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut on the spaceship (proper time), Δt is the time experienced by the person on Earth, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the factor √(1 - v^2/c^2):\n\n√(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) = √(1 - 0.64) = √(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can use this factor to find the time experienced by the astronaut on the spaceship:\n\nΔt' = Δt / 0.6\n\nSince we want to find how much longer one year on the spaceship seems to the astronaut compared to the person on Earth, we can set Δt = 1 year:\n\nΔt' = 1 year / 0.6 ≈ 1.67 years\n\nSo, one year on the spaceship will seem approximately 1.67 years to the astronaut on board compared to a person on Earth."
