    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy of gamma-ray photons and their wavelength can be described by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nIn high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, gamma-ray photons have very short wavelengths (typically less than 0.1 nanometers) and correspondingly high energies (in the range of keV to GeV or even TeV). This relationship between energy and wavelength is inversely proportional, meaning that as the wavelength decreases, the energy of the photon increases.\n\nUnderstanding this relationship helps us identify and study the sources of gamma-ray photons. High-energy gamma-ray photons are produced in extreme astrophysical environments, such as supernova explosions, pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts. By analyzing the energy and wavelength of gamma-ray photons, astronomers can gain insights into the physical processes occurring in these sources and the conditions under which they emit gamma rays.\n\nFor example, the energy spectrum of gamma-ray photons can provide information about the acceleration mechanisms of charged particles in these sources, as well as the interactions between these particles and the surrounding environment. Additionally, the detection of high-energy gamma rays can help us probe the nature of dark matter and test fundamental physics theories, such as Lorentz invariance and quantum gravity.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the energy of gamma-ray photons and their wavelength is crucial for understanding the sources of these photons in high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. This relationship allows astronomers to study the extreme astrophysical environments and physical processes responsible for the production of gamma rays, as well as probe fundamental physics theories."
