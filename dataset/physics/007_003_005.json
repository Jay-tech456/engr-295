How does this compare to the actual efficiency of modern nuclear power plants?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum theoretical efficiency of a nuclear power plant operating at a temperature of 600°C and a coolant temperature of 25°C, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the coolant (in Kelvin) and T_hot is the temperature of the heat source (in Kelvin).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT_cold = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT_hot = 600°C + 273.15 = 873.15 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (298.15 K / 873.15 K) = 1 - 0.3416 = 0.6584\n\nSince the ideal Rankine cycle has an efficiency of 85% of the Carnot efficiency, we can calculate the maximum theoretical efficiency of the nuclear power plant:\n\nMaximum theoretical efficiency = 0.6584 * 0.85 = 0.5596 or 55.96%\n\nNow, let's compare this to the actual efficiency of modern nuclear power plants. The actual efficiency of a nuclear power plant depends on various factors, including the type of reactor, the design of the plant, and the operating conditions. In general, the efficiency of modern nuclear power plants ranges from 30% to 40%. This is lower than the maximum theoretical efficiency we calculated, mainly due to non-ideal conditions, energy losses, and engineering limitations."
