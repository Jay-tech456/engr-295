    "message_2": "The critical temperature for the QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) phase transition between confined quarks (hadronic phase) and deconfined quarks (quark-gluon plasma) in a system with a net baryon density of 0 is not a fixed value but rather a range of temperatures. This is because the QCD phase transition is a complex process that depends on various factors, such as the number of quark flavors, their masses, and the strong coupling constant.\n\nLattice QCD simulations, which are numerical simulations of QCD on a discrete space-time lattice, have been used to study the QCD phase transition. From these simulations, the critical temperature for the QCD phase transition at vanishing baryon density is estimated to be in the range of 150-170 MeV (Mega-electron volts), which corresponds to approximately 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin.\n\nIt is important to note that this value is an approximation, and the actual critical temperature may vary depending on the specific conditions and assumptions made in the lattice QCD simulations."
