    "message_2": "The relationship between thermal conductivity (k) and temperature (T) for a specific material can be complex and depends on the material's properties and the temperature range being considered. In general, there are three primary mechanisms of heat conduction: lattice vibrations (phonons), free electrons, and impurities or defects in the material.\n\nFor many materials, the thermal conductivity can be described by the following empirical relationship:\n\nk(T) = A * T^n\n\nwhere A and n are material-specific constants. The value of n depends on the dominant heat conduction mechanism in the material.\n\n1. For insulators and some semiconductors, lattice vibrations (phonons) are the primary heat conduction mechanism. In this case, the thermal conductivity typically increases with temperature (n > 0). For example, in crystalline insulators, n is often close to 1.\n\n2. For metals, free electrons are the primary heat conduction mechanism. The thermal conductivity usually decreases with increasing temperature (n < 0). For example, in pure metals, n is often close to -1.\n\n3. For materials with a significant amount of impurities or defects, the thermal conductivity can be relatively independent of temperature (n â‰ˆ 0).\n\nIt is important to note that this empirical relationship may not hold for all temperature ranges and materials. In some cases, more complex models or experimental data are needed to accurately describe the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature for a specific material."
