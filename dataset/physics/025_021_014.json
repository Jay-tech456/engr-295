    "message_1": "What is the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) at a temperature of 298 K when a protein denatures from its native state to an unfolded state, given that the enthalpy change (∆H) is 185 kJ/mol and the entropy change (∆S) is 0.5 kJ/(mol*K)?",
    "message_2": "The Gibbs free energy change (∆G) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆H is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the entropy change.\n\nGiven the values:\n\n∆H = 185 kJ/mol\nT = 298 K\n∆S = 0.5 kJ/(mol*K)\n\nWe can now plug these values into the equation:\n\n∆G = 185 kJ/mol - (298 K * 0.5 kJ/(mol*K))\n\n∆G = 185 kJ/mol - 149 kJ/mol\n\n∆G = 36 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy when the protein denatures from its native state to an unfolded state at a temperature of 298 K is 36 kJ/mol."
