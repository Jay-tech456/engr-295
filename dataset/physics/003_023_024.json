    "message_1": "A generator produces a current of 20 A in a wire loop with a radius of 0.5 m. What is the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. For a circular loop, the formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nI = 20 A\nr = 0.5 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 A) / (2 * π * 0.5 m)\n\nB = (80π × 10^(-7) Tm) / π m\n\nB = 80 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
