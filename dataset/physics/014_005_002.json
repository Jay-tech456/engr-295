    "message_2": "The large-scale structure of the universe refers to the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on vast cosmic scales. According to the current understanding of cosmology, the universe has a hierarchical structure, with galaxies being the basic building blocks. These galaxies are organized into groups, clusters, and superclusters, which are interconnected by vast cosmic filaments and sheets, forming a complex cosmic web. This structure is primarily shaped by the interplay of dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons).\n\nThe formation of the large-scale structure can be traced back to the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. At that time, tiny fluctuations in the density of matter were present, as observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. These fluctuations, or seeds, were the result of quantum fluctuations that occurred during the inflationary epoch, a brief period of exponential expansion in the early universe.\n\nAs the universe expanded and cooled, gravity began to act on these density fluctuations. Regions with higher density attracted more matter, while regions with lower density lost matter. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, played a crucial role in this process. Due to its gravitational influence, dark matter formed the initial scaffolding for the cosmic web.\n\nOver time, baryonic matter started to fall into the gravitational potential wells created by dark matter, eventually forming galaxies and galaxy clusters. This process is known as hierarchical clustering, where smaller structures merge to form larger ones. The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters is not uniform but rather forms a cosmic web-like pattern, with vast cosmic filaments and sheets surrounding enormous voids.\n\nDark energy, which accounts for about 68% of the universe's total mass-energy content, also plays a significant role in shaping the large-scale structure. Dark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe, counteracting the attractive force of gravity. This accelerated expansion affects the growth of structures on the largest scales, limiting the size and density of galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\nIn summary, the large-scale structure of the universe is a complex cosmic web formed by the interplay of dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter. The formation of this structure can be traced back to the tiny density fluctuations in the early universe, which evolved through gravitational interactions and hierarchical clustering to create the vast cosmic structures we observe today."
