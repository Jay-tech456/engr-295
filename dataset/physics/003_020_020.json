    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 4 mm above the center of the capacitor, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nFor a parallel-plate capacitor, the magnetic field can be considered to be generated by two long straight wires carrying equal and opposite currents. The magnetic field due to each wire can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law, and the total magnetic field is the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each wire.\n\nThe magnetic field due to a long straight wire carrying a current I at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this problem, we have two wires carrying equal and opposite currents, separated by a distance equal to the width of the capacitor (5 cm). The distance from the center of the capacitor to each wire is half the width, or 2.5 cm. The distance from the point 4 mm above the center of the capacitor to each wire can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr₁ = √((2.5 cm)^2 + (4 mm)^2) = √((2.5 cm)^2 + (0.4 cm)^2) = √(6.41 cm^2) = 2.53 cm\nr₂ = r₁ (symmetry)\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field due to each wire:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 2.53 cm) = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (5.06 cm)\nB₂ = B₁ (symmetry)\n\nThe total magnetic field at the point 4 mm above the center of the capacitor is the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each wire. Since the magnetic fields are in opposite directions, we can subtract one from the other:\n\nB_total = B₁ - B₂ = 0 T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 4 mm above the center of the parallel-plate capacitor is 0 T."
