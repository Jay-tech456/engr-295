    "message_2": "The spin of an electron can be in one of two states: spin up (↑) or spin down (↓). These two states can be used to represent a qubit in a quantum system, where a qubit is the quantum analogue of a classical bit. Therefore, using the spin of an electron in a single quantum dot, you can encode 1 qubit.\n\nNow, let's determine the corresponding storage capacity in terms of classical bits. A qubit can exist in a superposition of both the spin up and spin down states, which means it can hold more information than a classical bit. However, when measured, a qubit collapses to either the spin up or spin down state, giving only one bit of classical information (0 or 1). So, the storage capacity of 1 qubit in terms of classical bits is still 1 bit, as you can only extract 1 bit of information upon measurement."
