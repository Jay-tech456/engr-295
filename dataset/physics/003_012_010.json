    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the plane, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to an infinite current-carrying sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the plane.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 5 A, and the distance d is 5 cm (0.05 m). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm * 5) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the plane, in a direction perpendicular to the plane, is 2 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
