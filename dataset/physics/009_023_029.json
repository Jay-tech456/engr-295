    "message_1": "A polarizer is used to filter a beam of light with an intensity of 50 W/m². When the polarizer is oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the beam, the intensity of the transmitted light decreases to 25 W/m². What is the angle between the polarizer and the beam for which the transmitted intensity will be zero? Use Malus' Law to solve for your answer.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of transmitted light through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, and θ is the angle between the polarizer and the beam.\n\nIn this case, we are given that I_incident = 50 W/m² and when θ = 45 degrees, I_transmitted = 25 W/m². We can use this information to find the proportionality constant:\n\n25 W/m² = 50 W/m² * cos²(45°)\n\nDividing both sides by 50 W/m²:\n\n0.5 = cos²(45°)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ for which the transmitted intensity will be zero. So, we set I_transmitted = 0 and solve for θ:\n\n0 = 50 W/m² * cos²(θ)\n\nSince I_incident is non-zero, we must have:\n\ncos²(θ) = 0\n\nThis implies that cos(θ) = 0. The cosine function is zero at odd multiples of 90° (or π/2 radians). Since we are looking for the angle between the polarizer and the beam, we consider the smallest positive odd multiple of 90°:\n\nθ = 90°\n\nSo, the angle between the polarizer and the beam for which the transmitted intensity will be zero is 90 degrees."
