    "message_2": "To find the angular separation between the first and third bright fringes, we first need to find the angles at which these fringes occur. In a single-slit diffraction pattern, the bright fringes occur at angles θ that satisfy the following equation:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 3 for the third bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light (600 nm), and a is the width of the slit (0.02 mm).\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.02 mm = 0.02 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angles for the first and third bright fringes:\n\nFor m = 1 (first bright fringe):\nsin(θ1) = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.02 * 10^(-3))\nθ1 = arcsin(sin(θ1)) ≈ 0.030 radians\n\nFor m = 3 (third bright fringe):\nsin(θ3) = (3 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.02 * 10^(-3))\nθ3 = arcsin(sin(θ3)) ≈ 0.090 radians\n\nFinally, we can find the angular separation between the first and third bright fringes:\nΔθ = θ3 - θ1 ≈ 0.090 - 0.030 = 0.060 radians\n\nTo convert this to degrees, we can use the following conversion:\n1 radian ≈ 57.296 degrees\n\nΔθ ≈ 0.060 * 57.296 ≈ 3.44 degrees\n\nSo, the angular separation between the first and third bright fringes is approximately 3.44 degrees."
