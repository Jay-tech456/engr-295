    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the specific heat capacity of a metal block. The block has an initial temperature of 100°C and is placed in a water bath at a temperature of 25°C. The mass of the block is 500 grams and the mass of the water in the bath is 1000 grams. After a few minutes, the block and water reach thermal equilibrium at a temperature of 35°C. What is the specific heat capacity of the metal block?",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific heat capacity of the metal block, we can use the formula for heat transfer:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nSince the metal block and water reach thermal equilibrium, the heat lost by the metal block is equal to the heat gained by the water. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nQ_metal = Q_water\n\nm_metal * c_metal * ΔT_metal = m_water * c_water * ΔT_water\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- m_metal = 500 g\n- m_water = 1000 g\n- Initial temperature of the metal block (T1_metal) = 100°C\n- Initial temperature of the water (T1_water) = 25°C\n- Final temperature of both (T2) = 35°C\n\nWe also know the specific heat capacity of water, c_water = 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nNow we can calculate the change in temperature for both the metal block and the water:\n\nΔT_metal = T2 - T1_metal = 35°C - 100°C = -65°C\nΔT_water = T2 - T1_water = 35°C - 25°C = 10°C\n\nNow we can plug these values into our equation:\n\n(500 g) * c_metal * (-65°C) = (1000 g) * (4.18 J/g°C) * (10°C)\n\nSolving for c_metal:\n\nc_metal = [(1000 g) * (4.18 J/g°C) * (10°C)] / [(500 g) * (-65°C)]\n\nc_metal = (41800 J) / (-32500 g°C)\n\nc_metal ≈ 1.286 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the metal block is approximately 1.286 J/g°C."
