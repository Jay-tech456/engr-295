    "message_2": "Dark matter and dark energy have significant impacts on the overall structure and expansion of the universe. They play crucial roles in shaping the cosmos and its evolution, even though they do not interact with observable matter and radiation in the same way as normal matter.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other observational instruments. However, it does interact with other matter through gravitational forces. It is estimated that dark matter constitutes about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. Its presence can be inferred from the gravitational effects it has on the motion of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It acts as a gravitational scaffold that allows normal matter to clump together and form the structures we observe today. Without dark matter, galaxies would not have formed, and the universe would look very different.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is believed to make up about 68% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. Unlike dark matter, dark energy does not clump or interact with matter through gravitational forces. Instead, it has a repulsive effect, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter, dark energy, and observable matter and radiation is complex. While dark matter interacts with normal matter through gravity, it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. This means that it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. Dark energy, on the other hand, does not interact with matter or radiation in any known way, other than its effect on the expansion of the universe.\n\nTo study the properties of dark matter and dark energy, scientists rely on indirect methods, such as observing their effects on the large-scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation. By analyzing these observations, researchers can develop models and simulations to better understand the nature of these mysterious components of the universe.\n\nIn summary, dark matter and dark energy have significant impacts on the overall structure and expansion of the universe. They play crucial roles in shaping the cosmos and its evolution, even though they do not interact with observable matter and radiation in the same way as normal matter. Their properties can be indirectly measured and modeled through observations of their effects on the large-scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation. However, many aspects of dark matter and dark energy remain unknown, and their precise nature is still a subject of ongoing research in the field of cosmology."
