    "message_2": "The wavelength of light plays a crucial role in determining the color perception in the human eye. The human eye contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light and converting it into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. There are two main types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.\n\nRods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light: S-cones (short-wavelength), M-cones (medium-wavelength), and L-cones (long-wavelength). These cones are sensitive to blue, green, and red light, respectively.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the lens, and the vitreous humor before reaching the retina, where the photoreceptors are located. The cones in the retina absorb the light and respond to specific wavelengths, which correspond to different colors.\n\nThe color perception in the human eye is based on the principle of trichromacy, which states that any color can be created by combining the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The brain processes the signals from the cones and interprets the combination of signals as a specific color.\n\nThe wavelength of light affects color perception in the following way:\n\n1. Short-wavelength light (around 400-500 nm) is perceived as blue. This is due to the activation of S-cones.\n2. Medium-wavelength light (around 500-600 nm) is perceived as green. This is due to the activation of M-cones.\n3. Long-wavelength light (around 600-700 nm) is perceived as red. This is due to the activation of L-cones.\n\nWhen different wavelengths of light are combined, they create various colors that we perceive. For example, when both M-cones and L-cones are activated, we perceive the color yellow. The precise color perception depends on the ratio of activation of the different cones and the intensity of the light.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light affects color perception in the human eye by activating specific cones in the retina, which then send signals to the brain to be interpreted as a particular color. The combination of signals from the three types of cones allows us to perceive a wide range of colors."
