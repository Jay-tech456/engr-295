    "message_1": "A rectangular flat plate of dimension 0.1m x 0.2m is submerged in a water tank. When the water is at rest, the plate is stationary. But as soon as the pump is turned ON, the water starts flowing in the tank and the plate begins to vibrate at a frequency of 22.4 Hz. The amplitude of vibration is found to be 0.1 mm. Calculate the flow velocity of water that causes the vibration of the plate.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Strouhal number (St), which is a dimensionless parameter that relates the frequency of vortex shedding (vibration) to the flow velocity and the characteristic length of the object (in this case, the width of the plate). The Strouhal number is given by:\n\nSt = (f * L) / V\n\nwhere f is the frequency of vibration, L is the characteristic length (width of the plate), and V is the flow velocity of the water.\n\nWe are given the frequency (f) as 22.4 Hz and the width of the plate (L) as 0.1 m. We need to find the flow velocity (V). To do this, we need to know the Strouhal number for this situation. For a rectangular flat plate, the Strouhal number is typically around 0.2.\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to solve for V:\n\nV = (f * L) / St\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nV = (22.4 Hz * 0.1 m) / 0.2\n\nV = 2.24 m/s\n\nSo, the flow velocity of water that causes the vibration of the plate is approximately 2.24 m/s."
