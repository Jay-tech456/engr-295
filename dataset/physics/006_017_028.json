    "message_2": "To calculate the electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, we need to use the formula:\n\nESR frequency (ν) = g * μ_B * B / h\n\nwhere:\n- ν is the ESR frequency\n- g is the electron g-factor (approximately 2 for a free electron)\n- μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T)\n- B is the magnetic field strength (5 Tesla in this case)\n- h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nν = 2 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * 5 T / (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n\nν ≈ 1.399 x 10^10 Hz\n\nThe electron spin resonance frequency of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field with a strength of 5 Tesla is approximately 13.99 GHz."
