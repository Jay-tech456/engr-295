    "message_2": "The gravitino is a hypothetical particle predicted by supersymmetry, a theory that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. As a candidate for dark matter, the gravitino's mass range is subject to both experimental constraints and theoretical models.\n\nThe predicted mass range for gravitinos varies depending on the specific supersymmetric model and the assumptions made within that model. Generally, the mass range can span from a few eV (electron volts) to several TeV (tera electron volts).\n\nIn the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models, gravitinos are often considered to be very light, with masses in the range of keV (kilo electron volts) to MeV (mega electron volts). In these models, gravitinos are considered as warm dark matter candidates.\n\nOn the other hand, in gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking (mSUGRA) models, gravitinos can have masses in the range of GeV (giga electron volts) to TeV. In these scenarios, gravitinos are considered as cold dark matter candidates.\n\nExperimental constraints from astrophysical observations, collider experiments, and cosmological considerations can further narrow down the allowed mass range for gravitinos. For example, constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background radiation, and gamma-ray observations can limit the gravitino mass to be below a few hundred GeV.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range for gravitinos as a candidate for dark matter is subject to the specific supersymmetric model and experimental constraints. The mass range can vary from a few eV to several TeV, with lighter gravitinos being considered as warm dark matter candidates and heavier gravitinos as cold dark matter candidates."
