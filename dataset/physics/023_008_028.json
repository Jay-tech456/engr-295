    "message_2": "The fidelity of quantum teleportation is a measure of how accurately the quantum state is transferred from one qubit to another. The degree of entanglement between the two qubits used in the process is a crucial factor in determining the fidelity of the teleportation.\n\nLet's consider a simple case of quantum teleportation using two qubits A and B, which are entangled in the following Bell state:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nHere, A is the qubit to be teleported, and B is the qubit that will receive the teleported state. The initial state of qubit A is |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex coefficients satisfying |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.\n\nThe combined state of the two qubits is given by:\n\n|Ψ_AB⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩) ⊗ (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩)\n\nNow, we perform a Bell measurement on qubit A, which projects the combined state onto one of the four Bell states:\n\n|Φ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ ± |11⟩)\n|Ψ±⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ ± |10⟩)\n\nThe probability of obtaining each of these Bell states is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial state and the respective Bell state. After the measurement, the state of qubit B will be:\n\n|Ψ_B⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nNow, let's calculate the fidelity F of the teleportation process, which is the overlap between the initial state |ψ⟩ and the final state |Ψ_B⟩:\n\nF = |⟨ψ|Ψ_B⟩|^2 = |α^2 + β^2|^2 = |α|^4 + |β|^4 + 2|α|^2|β|^2\n\nSince |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1, the fidelity F is maximized when the two qubits are maximally entangled, i.e., when |α|^2 = |β|^2 = 1/2. In this case, the fidelity is:\n\nF_max = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 + 2(1/2)^2 = 1\n\nThis means that the fidelity of quantum teleportation is directly related to the degree of entanglement between the two qubits. The more entangled the qubits are, the higher the fidelity of the teleportation process. In the case of maximal entanglement, the fidelity is equal to 1, indicating perfect teleportation of the quantum state."
