    "message_2": "To find the Boyle temperature, we need to use the combined gas law, which is given by:\n\n(P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2\n\nwhere P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, T1 is the initial temperature (Boyle temperature), P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (P1) as 4 atm, the initial volume (V1) as 2 L, the final pressure (P2) as 2 atm, and the final temperature (T2) as 500 K. We need to find the initial temperature (T1), which is the Boyle temperature.\n\nSince the gas experiences a decrease in pressure while being heated, we can assume that the volume remains constant (V1 = V2). Therefore, the combined gas law equation becomes:\n\n(P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V1) / T2\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\n(4 atm * 2 L) / T1 = (2 atm * 2 L) / 500 K\n\nSolving for T1:\n\n8 atm L / T1 = 4 atm L / 500 K\n\nTo isolate T1, we can cross-multiply:\n\n8 atm L * 500 K = 4 atm L * T1\n\n4000 K atm L = 4 atm L * T1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4 atm L:\n\nT1 = 1000 K\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature of the gas is 1000 K."
