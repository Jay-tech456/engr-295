    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of nitrogen gas and oxygen gas in the tank, we will use the Van der Waals equation of state, which is a more accurate model for real gases than the ideal gas law. The Van der Waals equation is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, n is the number of moles, V is the volume, T is the temperature, R is the gas constant, and a and b are the Van der Waals constants for the specific gas.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Van der Waals constants for nitrogen and oxygen. These constants can be found in tables or online resources. For nitrogen (N2), a = 1.39 L^2 atm/mol^2 and b = 0.0391 L/mol. For oxygen (O2), a = 1.36 L^2 atm/mol^2 and b = 0.0318 L/mol.\n\nNext, we need to find the total volume of the tank. We can use the ideal gas law to get an approximate value for the volume:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the total pressure (2 atm), n is the total number of moles (10 moles of N2 + 6 moles of O2 = 16 moles), R is the gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is the temperature (300 K).\n\n(2 atm)(V) = (16 moles)(0.0821 L atm/mol K)(300 K)\nV ≈ 393.6 L\n\nNow we can find the partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen using the mole fractions:\n\nMole fraction of N2 = moles of N2 / total moles = 10 moles / 16 moles = 0.625\nMole fraction of O2 = moles of O2 / total moles = 6 moles / 16 moles = 0.375\n\nPartial pressure of N2 = mole fraction of N2 × total pressure = 0.625 × 2 atm = 1.25 atm\nPartial pressure of O2 = mole fraction of O2 × total pressure = 0.375 × 2 atm = 0.75 atm\n\nNow we can use the Van der Waals equation to find the fugacity (f) of each gas. The fugacity is related to the partial pressure by a fugacity coefficient (ϕ):\n\nf = ϕP\n\nFor real gases, the fugacity coefficient can be approximated using the Van der Waals equation:\n\nϕ ≈ exp[(a/bRT)(P - P')]\n\nwhere P' is the partial pressure of the gas, and a and b are the Van der Waals constants for the specific gas.\n\nFor nitrogen:\n\nϕ_N2 ≈ exp[(1.39 L^2 atm/mol^2 / 0.0391 L/mol)(1.25 atm - 1 atm) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K)(300 K)]\nϕ_N2 ≈ 1.023\n\nFor oxygen:\n\nϕ_O2 ≈ exp[(1.36 L^2 atm/mol^2 / 0.0318 L/mol)(0.75 atm - 1 atm) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K)(300 K)]\nϕ_O2 ≈ 0.978\n\nFinally, we can find the fugacity of each gas:\n\nFugacity of N2 = ϕ_N2 × partial pressure of N2 = 1.023 × 1.25 atm ≈ 1.279 atm\nFugacity of O2 = ϕ_O2 × partial pressure of O2 = 0.978 × 0.75 atm ≈ 0.7335 atm\n\nSo, the fugacity of nitrogen gas in the tank is approximately 1.279 atm, and the fugacity of oxygen gas in the tank is approximately 0.7335 atm."
