    "message_2": "To determine the maximum size of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole, we can use the Shakura-Sunyaev model, which describes the structure and properties of an accretion disk. The model is based on the balance between the gravitational force pulling the gas towards the black hole and the viscous force resisting the gas flow.\n\nThe maximum size of the accretion disk (R_max) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nR_max = (GM_blackhole * M_dot) / (2 * π * α * c_s^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M_blackhole is the mass of the black hole, M_dot is the accretion rate, α is the viscosity parameter, and c_s is the sound speed in the disk.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole and the accretion rate to SI units (kilograms):\n\nM_blackhole = 10 million solar masses = 10^7 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^37 kg\nM_dot = 1 solar mass per year = 1.989 × 10^30 kg / (365.25 * 24 * 3600) s = 6.307 × 10^22 kg/s\n\nNext, we need to estimate the sound speed in the disk. A typical value for the sound speed in an accretion disk is around 10^4 m/s. However, this value can vary depending on the specific properties of the disk.\n\nUsing these values, we can now calculate the maximum size of the accretion disk:\n\nR_max = (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^37 kg * 6.307 × 10^22 kg/s) / (2 * π * 0.1 * (10^4 m/s)^2)\nR_max ≈ 1.32 × 10^15 m\n\nSo, the maximum size of the accretion disk surrounding a black hole with a mass of 10 million solar masses, assuming a viscosity parameter of 0.1 and an accretion rate of 1 solar mass per year, is approximately 1.32 × 10^15 meters."
