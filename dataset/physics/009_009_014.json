    "message_2": "To determine the position, nature, and size of the image formed by a converging lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance (distance between the object and the lens), and v is the image distance (distance between the image and the lens).\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm (converging lens)\nu = -20 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20v, we get:\n\n2v = -v + 20v\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n3v = 20v\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive, the image formed is real and inverted.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nm = -20 / -20\n\nm = 1\n\nSince the magnification is 1, the size of the image is the same as the size of the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the converging lens is real, inverted, and located 20 cm from the lens on the opposite side of the object. The size of the image is the same as the size of the object."
