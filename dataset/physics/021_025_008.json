    "message_2": "The likelihood of primordial black holes (PBHs) forming from collapsed regions in the early universe is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among physicists. Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the very early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, due to density fluctuations in the expanding universe.\n\nThe current understanding of black hole formation and growth theories suggests that PBHs could have formed if the density fluctuations were large enough to overcome the expansion of the universe and collapse into black holes. However, the exact likelihood of this happening is still uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as the nature of the density fluctuations, the properties of the early universe, and the underlying cosmological model.\n\nObservational constraints from cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure formation, and gravitational wave detections have provided some limits on the abundance and mass range of PBHs. These constraints suggest that PBHs cannot be the dominant form of dark matter, but they could still exist as a subdominant component or in specific mass ranges.\n\nIn summary, the likelihood of primordial black holes forming from collapsed regions in the early universe is still an open question in physics. While there is some theoretical motivation for their existence, more research and observational data are needed to determine their actual abundance and role in the universe."
