    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by the astronauts on the spaceship, we can use the time dilation formula derived from the special theory of relativity:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere:\nt' is the dilated time experienced by the astronauts,\nt is the proper time experienced by an observer at rest,\nv is the velocity of the spaceship (80% of the speed of light),\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity of the spaceship:\n\nv = 0.8 * c\nv = 0.8 * (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nv = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - ((2.4 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nt' = t / sqrt(0.36)\nt' = t / 0.6\n\nThe time dilation factor is 1/0.6, which means that for every second experienced by an observer at rest, the astronauts on the spaceship will experience 1/0.6 = 1.67 seconds.\n\nNow, let's determine the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole to find its event horizon. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by the formula:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere:\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nM is the mass of the black hole,\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo find the Schwarzschild radius, we need to know the mass of the black hole. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement. If the mass of the black hole is given, you can use the formula above to calculate the Schwarzschild radius and find the event horizon."
