    "message_1": "A current-carrying generator has 100 turns of wire in a circular loop with a diameter of 0.2 meters. The current in the wire is 6 amps. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, located 0.1 meters from the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the loop:\n\nDiameter = 0.2 meters\nRadius (R) = Diameter / 2 = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 meters\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6 A * 100 turns * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 6 * 100 * 0.01) / (2 * (0.01 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (24π × 10^(-7) * 100 * 0.01) / (2 * (0.02)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (7.54 × 10^(-5) * 100 * 0.01) / (2 * 0.0283)\n\nB ≈ (7.54 × 10^(-3)) / (2 * 0.0283)\n\nB ≈ 0.133 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the loop is approximately 0.133 T (tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it follows the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (counterclockwise when looking at the loop from the point on the axis), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field direction is along the axis of the loop, pointing away from the center of the loop."
