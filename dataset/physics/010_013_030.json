    "message_2": "The maximum angle of attack at which a wing can maintain a smooth flow over its upper surface without experiencing flow separation and stall depends on the specific airfoil shape and the Reynolds number, which is a measure of the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in the flow.\n\nFor a symmetric airfoil, the critical angle of attack is typically around 12-15 degrees. However, this value can vary depending on the specific airfoil shape and the Reynolds number. Since we don't have information about the specific airfoil shape and the Reynolds number, we can only provide an approximate range for the maximum angle of attack.\n\nSo, for the given wing with a chord of 1 meter and a velocity of 100 meters per second, the maximum angle of attack to maintain a smooth flow over its upper surface without experiencing flow separation and stall would be approximately between 12 and 15 degrees."
