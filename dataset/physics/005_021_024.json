    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of light in the first medium (vacuum). The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Since the beam of light is traveling at 0.8 times the speed of light, its speed in the first medium is:\n\nv1 = 0.8 * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of light in the second medium. We can use the formula:\n\nv2 = c / n2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nv2 = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.5 = 2.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the speeds of light in the two media:\n\nv1 / v2 = (2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.0 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.2\n\nSince the beam of light is entering the second medium from the first medium, we can use the ratio of the speeds of light to find the sine of the angle of incidence:\n\nsin(θ1) = v1 / v2 = 1.2\n\nHowever, this result is not possible, as the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. This means that the given information is not physically possible, and we cannot calculate the angle of refraction for this scenario."
