    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. The likelihood of black holes being the source of primordial black holes depends on the specific formation mechanisms and the conditions in the early universe.\n\nThere are several proposed mechanisms for the formation of primordial black holes, including:\n\n1. Density fluctuations: If there were regions in the early universe with sufficiently high density, they could have collapsed under their own gravity to form PBHs. This could have happened during the radiation-dominated era, when the universe was dominated by radiation rather than matter.\n\n2. Cosmic phase transitions: During the early universe, there might have been phase transitions, such as the breaking of symmetries in particle physics. These phase transitions could have produced PBHs as a byproduct.\n\n3. Cosmic string loops: Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that could have formed during phase transitions in the early universe. If cosmic string loops were to collapse under their own gravity, they could potentially form PBHs.\n\nThe evidence supporting the existence of primordial black holes is indirect and mostly based on theoretical considerations. Some of the potential observational evidence includes:\n\n1. Gravitational waves: The merger of PBHs could produce gravitational waves, which could be detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. However, the current gravitational wave detections are consistent with mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and it is not yet possible to distinguish between PBHs and stellar-mass black holes based on gravitational wave data alone.\n\n2. Microlensing: PBHs could act as gravitational lenses, causing the light from distant stars to be magnified as the PBH passes in front of them. This effect, known as microlensing, has been observed for other objects like stars and planets, but no definitive detection of a PBH has been made through microlensing.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The presence of PBHs in the early universe could have affected the CMB radiation, leaving imprints that could be detected today. However, the current CMB data does not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of PBHs.\n\nIn summary, the likelihood of black holes being the source of primordial black holes depends on the specific formation mechanisms and the conditions in the early universe. While there is no direct observational evidence for the existence of PBHs, several indirect lines of evidence suggest that they could exist. Further observations and theoretical developments are needed to determine the true nature and origin of primordial black holes."
