    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 632.8 nm passes through a single slit with a width of 0.02 mm. What is the angle of diffraction of the laser beam at a distance of 2 meters from the slit?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of diffraction, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nθ = arcsin(λ / b)\n\nwhere θ is the angle of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of the light, and b is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength is given in nanometers (nm) and the slit width is given in millimeters (mm). We can convert the wavelength to millimeters:\n\n632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-6) mm = 0.0006328 mm\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.0006328 / 0.02)\n\nθ = arcsin(0.03164)\n\nθ ≈ 1.81°\n\nSo the angle of diffraction of the laser beam at a distance of 2 meters from the slit is approximately 1.81 degrees."
