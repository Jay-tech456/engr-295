    "message_2": "The amplitude of the gravitational wave detected by the LIGO detector on the 14th of September, 2015, was approximately 1.0 x 10^-21. This event, known as GW150914, was the first direct observation of gravitational waves and confirmed the existence of these waves, as predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity."
