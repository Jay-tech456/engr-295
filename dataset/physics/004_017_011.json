    "message_2": "To calculate the angular deviation of light from a distant star as it passes by a massive object, we can use the formula for gravitational lensing, which is derived from the general theory of relativity. The formula for the angular deviation (Δθ) is given by:\n\nΔθ = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the massive object (2 × 10^30 kg), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and b is the closest approach of light to the object (10,000 km).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the closest approach distance (b) from kilometers to meters:\n\nb = 10,000 km * 1,000 m/km = 1 × 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔθ = (4 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 2 × 10^30 kg) / (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2 * 1 × 10^7 m)\n\nΔθ = (5.348 × 10^20 kg m^3/s^2) / (9 × 10^23 m^3/s^2)\n\nΔθ = 5.942 × 10^-4 radians\n\nTo convert radians to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor of 206,265 arcseconds per radian:\n\nΔθ = 5.942 × 10^-4 radians * 206,265 arcseconds/radian\n\nΔθ ≈ 1.225 arcseconds\n\nSo, the angular deviation of light from the distant star as it passes by the massive object is approximately 1.225 arcseconds."
