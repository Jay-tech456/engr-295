    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the velocity of the tennis ball, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js).\n\nIn this case, the mass of the tennis ball (m) is 58 g or 0.058 kg, and the uncertainty in position (Δx) is 0.1 cm or 0.001 m. We want to find the uncertainty in velocity (Δv), and we know that momentum (p) is equal to mass times velocity (p = mv). Therefore, the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is equal to mass times the uncertainty in velocity (Δp = mΔv).\n\nNow we can rewrite the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation as:\n\nΔx * mΔv ≥ ħ/2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in velocity (Δv), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nΔv ≥ (ħ/2) / (mΔx)\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nΔv ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (0.058 kg * 0.001 m)\n\nΔv ≥ 1.8140896 × 10^-32 kg m/s / 5.8 × 10^-5 kg m\n\nΔv ≥ 3.1274024 × 10^-28 m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the velocity of the tennis ball is approximately 3.13 × 10^-28 m/s."
