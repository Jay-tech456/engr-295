    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection, is given by the following formula:\n\ntan(θ_B) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere θ_B is the Brewster's angle, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium, and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1.0 (air) and n2 = 1.5 (glass). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\ntan(θ_B) = 1.5 / 1.0\ntan(θ_B) = 1.5\n\nNow, to find the Brewster's angle, we need to take the arctangent of 1.5:\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.5)\n\nθ_B ≈ 56.31°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence for a light ray to be completely polarized when it is incident on an interface between two media with refractive indices of 1.5 and 1.0, according to Brewster's Law, is approximately 56.31°."
