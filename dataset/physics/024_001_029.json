    "message_1": "What is the maximum angle of displacement that the lower pendulum in a double pendulum system can reach before it loses coherence and starts to exhibit chaotic behavior?",
    "message_2": "The onset of chaotic behavior in a double pendulum system is highly sensitive to the initial conditions and parameters of the system, such as the lengths and masses of the pendulum rods. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific maximum angle of displacement for the lower pendulum that applies universally to all double pendulum systems.\n\nHowever, it is known that when the initial angles of the pendulums are small, the motion of the double pendulum can be approximated as a linear system, and the behavior is more predictable. As the initial angles increase, the system becomes more nonlinear, and the likelihood of chaotic behavior increases.\n\nTo study the onset of chaos in a specific double pendulum system, one can perform numerical simulations or experiments by varying the initial angles and observing the resulting motion. This can help to identify the approximate threshold at which the system transitions from regular to chaotic behavior."
