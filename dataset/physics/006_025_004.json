    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released when one mole of uranium-235 undergoes fission, we first need to know the energy released per fission event. The energy released per fission event for uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts).\n\n1 mole of uranium-235 contains Avogadro's number of atoms, which is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms.\n\nEnergy released per mole = (Energy released per fission event) x (Number of atoms in a mole)\nEnergy released per mole = 200 MeV/atom x 6.022 x 10^23 atoms\n\nTo convert MeV to Joules, we use the conversion factor 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 Joules.\n\nEnergy released per mole = 200 x 1.602 x 10^-13 J/atom x 6.022 x 10^23 atoms\nEnergy released per mole ≈ 1.93 x 10^11 Joules\n\nNow, let's determine how many megawatts of power can be generated by a reactor that uses 100 metric tons of enriched uranium-235 fuel per year, assuming 1 percent of the fuel's energy is converted into electrical power.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many moles are in 100 metric tons of uranium-235. The molar mass of uranium-235 is approximately 235 grams/mole.\n\n100 metric tons = 100,000,000 grams\n\nNumber of moles = (Mass of uranium-235) / (Molar mass of uranium-235)\nNumber of moles = 100,000,000 g / 235 g/mole ≈ 4.26 x 10^5 moles\n\nTotal energy released = (Energy released per mole) x (Number of moles)\nTotal energy released ≈ 1.93 x 10^11 J/mole x 4.26 x 10^5 moles ≈ 8.22 x 10^16 Joules\n\nSince 1 percent of the fuel's energy is converted into electrical power, the useful energy is:\n\nUseful energy = 0.01 x 8.22 x 10^16 Joules ≈ 8.22 x 10^14 Joules\n\nNow, we need to convert this energy into power. Power is energy divided by time. Since we are given the energy per year, we will convert the energy to power in megawatts.\n\n1 year = 365 days x 24 hours/day x 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 3.15 x 10^7 seconds\n\nPower = (Useful energy) / (Time)\nPower = 8.22 x 10^14 Joules / 3.15 x 10^7 seconds ≈ 2.61 x 10^7 Watts\n\nTo convert Watts to Megawatts, we divide by 1,000,000:\n\nPower ≈ 2.61 x 10^7 W / 1,000,000 ≈ 26.1 Megawatts\n\nTherefore, a reactor that uses 100 metric tons of enriched uranium-235 fuel per year can generate approximately 26.1 Megawatts of electrical power, assuming 1 percent of the fuel's energy is converted into electrical power."
