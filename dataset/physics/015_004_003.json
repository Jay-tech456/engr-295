    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial mass of the star (20 solar masses) to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from the Earth (10 kpc) to meters. One kiloparsec (kpc) is approximately 3.086 x 10^19 meters, so:\n\nR = 10 * 3.086 x 10^19 m = 3.086 x 10^20 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.086 x 10^20 m)\n\nE â‰ˆ 2 x 10^46 J (joules)\n\nSo, the estimated energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion of a star with an initial mass of 20 solar masses, assuming a distance of 10 kpc from Earth and a duration of the burst of 1 second, is approximately 2 x 10^46 joules. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual energy emitted can vary depending on the specific properties of the supernova and the surrounding environment."
