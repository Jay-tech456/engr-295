    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the Feynman diagram for electron-electron scattering is represented by the exchange of a virtual photon between two electrons. This process is also known as Møller scattering. The diagram consists of two incoming electron lines, a virtual photon line, and two outgoing electron lines.\n\nTo predict the probability of the scattered electrons' energies and angles, we need to calculate the scattering amplitude using the Feynman rules for QED. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Draw the Feynman diagram: As mentioned earlier, the diagram consists of two incoming electron lines, a virtual photon line, and two outgoing electron lines.\n\n2. Label the momenta: Assign momenta to the incoming and outgoing electrons. Let the incoming electrons have momenta p1 and p2, and the outgoing electrons have momenta p3 and p4.\n\n3. Assign the vertices: There are two vertices in this diagram, where the electrons interact with the virtual photon. Each vertex contributes a factor of -ie (where e is the electron charge and i is the imaginary unit).\n\n4. Propagator for the virtual photon: The virtual photon carries momentum q, which is the difference between the momenta of the interacting electrons (q = p1 - p3 = p2 - p4). The photon propagator is given by -i(g^μν) / (q^2), where g^μν is the metric tensor and q^2 is the square of the photon's momentum.\n\n5. Calculate the matrix element (M): The matrix element is the product of the vertex factors and the propagator. In this case, M = (-ie)^2 (-i(g^μν) / (q^2)) = (e^2 g^μν) / (q^2).\n\n6. Calculate the differential cross-section: The differential cross-section (dσ/dΩ) is related to the square of the matrix element, |M|^2, and some kinematic factors. For electron-electron scattering, the differential cross-section is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / (4s)) * (s + u)^2 / (t^2)\n\nHere, α = e^2 / (4π) is the fine-structure constant, s, t, and u are the Mandelstam variables, and Ω is the solid angle.\n\n7. Integrate the differential cross-section: To find the total cross-section or the probability distribution of the scattered electrons' energies and angles, integrate the differential cross-section over the relevant range of angles.\n\nBy following these steps, we can predict the probability of the scattered electrons' energies and angles in electron-electron scattering in QED using the Feynman diagram."
