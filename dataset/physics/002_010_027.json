    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water is the amount of heat required to convert 1 kg of water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase at a constant temperature and pressure, in this case, at its boiling point of 100°C and atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe latent heat of vaporization of water at 100°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 2,260,000 J/kg (joules per kilogram). This value may vary slightly depending on the reference source, but it is generally accepted to be around this value."
