    "message_1": "A particle initially at rest with respect to a massive body starts moving toward it. If the massive body is a non-rotating black hole with a Schwarzschild radius of 10 kilometers, what is the distance from the black hole that the particle will cross the event horizon if its initial velocity is 1/2 of the escape velocity at the starting position? Use the geodesic equation to determine the particle's trajectory.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the geodesic equation for a Schwarzschild black hole. The Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and r is the radial coordinate.\n\nThe escape velocity at a distance r from the black hole is given by:\n\nv_esc = sqrt(2GM/r)\n\nThe initial velocity of the particle is half of the escape velocity:\n\nv_init = 1/2 * v_esc = sqrt(GM/2r)\n\nNow, we need to find the trajectory of the particle using the geodesic equation. For a radial free-fall trajectory, the geodesic equation can be simplified to:\n\n(1 - 2GM/c²r) * (dt/dτ)² - (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1) * (dr/dτ)² = -c²\n\nwhere τ is the proper time.\n\nWe are given the initial velocity of the particle, so we can find dr/dτ at the starting position:\n\n(dr/dτ)² = (v_init)² / (1 - 2GM/c²r)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression into the geodesic equation and solve for dt/dτ:\n\n(1 - 2GM/c²r) * (dt/dτ)² - (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1) * (v_init)² / (1 - 2GM/c²r) = -c²\n\n(dt/dτ)² = (c² + (v_init)²) / (1 - 2GM/c²r)\n\nTo find the distance at which the particle crosses the event horizon, we need to find the value of r when the particle reaches the Schwarzschild radius (r = 10 km):\n\n10 km = 2GM/c²\n\nSolving for M, we get:\n\nM = (10 km * c²) / (2G)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for M back into the geodesic equation and solve for r:\n\n(dt/dτ)² = (c² + (v_init)²) / (1 - 2G((10 km * c²) / (2G))/c²r)\n\nThis equation can be solved numerically to find the value of r when the particle crosses the event horizon. However, it's important to note that this is a complex problem, and a full numerical solution would require advanced mathematical techniques and software."
