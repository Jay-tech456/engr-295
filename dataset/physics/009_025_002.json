    "message_2": "To calculate the numerical aperture (NA) of an optical fiber, we use the following formula:\n\nNA = √(n_core^2 - n_cladding^2)\n\nwhere n_core is the refractive index of the core and n_cladding is the refractive index of the cladding.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nNA = √((1.45)^2 - (1.42)^2)\nNA = √(2.1025 - 2.0164)\nNA = √(0.0861)\nNA ≈ 0.293\n\nSo the numerical aperture of the optical fiber is approximately 0.293.\n\nNow, to find the acceptance angle (θ) of the fiber, we use the following formula:\n\nsin(θ) = NA / n_air\n\nwhere n_air is the refractive index of air, which is approximately 1.\n\nsin(θ) = 0.293 / 1\nsin(θ) = 0.293\n\nNow, we find the inverse sine (arcsin) to get the angle:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.293)\nθ ≈ 17.1°\n\nSo the acceptance angle of the fiber is approximately 17.1 degrees."
