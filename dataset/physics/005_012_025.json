    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of a proton with a velocity of 0.8c, we'll use the following equation:\n\nRelativistic kinetic energy (KE) = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.8c).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nThe mass of a proton (m) is approximately 1.6726 x 10^-27 kg, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nKE = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nKE = (1.6667 - 1) * (1.6726 x 10^-27 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nKE ≈ 0.6667 * (1.6726 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nKE ≈ 1.116 x 10^-10 Joules\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of a proton with a velocity of 0.8c is approximately 1.116 x 10^-10 Joules."
