    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of dimensions 4 cm x 6 cm is carrying a current of 5 A. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 3 cm away from the sheet along its central axis.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 3 cm away from the sheet along its central axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to an infinite current sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (5 A), and d is the distance from the sheet (3 cm = 0.03 m).\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB = (20π x 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.06 m)\n\nB = (10π x 10^(-6) T) / (0.03 m)\n\nB ≈ 1.047 x 10^(-4) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 3 cm away from the sheet along its central axis is approximately 1.047 x 10^(-4) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the 6 cm side) and curl your fingers, the direction of the magnetic field will be in the direction your fingers curl. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing into the sheet on one side and out of the sheet on the other side. Since we are not given a specific side, we can say that the magnetic field is either pointing into or out of the sheet, depending on which side of the sheet the point is located."
