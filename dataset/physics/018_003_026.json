    "message_1": "A precision question related to Electroweak theory that a physics student could solve is: How is the electroweak force related to the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, and what experimental evidence supports this theory?",
    "message_2": "The electroweak force is a unified force that describes the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces as different aspects of the same fundamental interaction. This unification is based on the work of Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for their contributions to the electroweak theory.\n\nThe electroweak force is mediated by four force-carrying particles called bosons. The electromagnetic force is mediated by the photon, while the weak nuclear force is mediated by the W+, W-, and Z bosons. The electroweak theory describes how these bosons interact with each other and with other particles, such as electrons and quarks.\n\nThe electroweak theory is supported by a wealth of experimental evidence. One of the key predictions of the theory is the existence of the W and Z bosons, which were discovered in 1983 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Their discovery confirmed the electroweak unification and provided strong evidence for the validity of the theory.\n\nAnother important piece of experimental evidence is the observation of neutral current interactions, which involve the exchange of a Z boson. These interactions were first observed in 1973 at CERN and provided crucial support for the electroweak theory.\n\nAdditionally, the electroweak theory has been tested through precision measurements of various particle properties, such as their masses and decay rates. These measurements have been found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of the electroweak theory, further supporting its validity.\n\nIn summary, the electroweak force unifies the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces through the exchange of four bosons (photon, W+, W-, and Z). Experimental evidence, such as the discovery of the W and Z bosons and the observation of neutral current interactions, supports the electroweak theory and its description of these fundamental interactions."
