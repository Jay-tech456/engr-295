    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), or about -270.425 degrees Celsius. This value has been measured with great precision by various experiments, such as the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite and the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) mission.\n\nThe CMB radiation is the relic radiation from the early universe, which was emitted when the universe was about 380,000 years old. At that time, the universe had cooled down enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process is known as recombination. Before recombination, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of charged particles, and photons were constantly scattered by these particles, making the universe opaque. After recombination, the universe became transparent, allowing photons to travel freely through space. These photons have been traveling through the universe ever since and have been stretched by the expansion of the universe, resulting in the current CMB radiation we observe today.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB radiation and its nearly uniform distribution across the sky have significant implications for our understanding of the early universe:\n\n1. The CMB temperature supports the Big Bang theory: The observed temperature of the CMB is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n2. The CMB confirms the universe's expansion: The redshift of the CMB photons due to the expansion of the universe provides strong evidence for the universe's expansion over time.\n\n3. The CMB provides information about the early universe's composition: The CMB's temperature and spectrum allow physicists to infer the relative abundance of different elements in the early universe, such as hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium.\n\n4. The CMB reveals the seeds of cosmic structure: Although the CMB is remarkably uniform, there are tiny fluctuations in temperature (on the order of 1 part in 100,000) that correspond to density variations in the early universe. These density variations are believed to be the seeds of the large-scale structure of the universe, including galaxies, galaxy clusters, and cosmic voids.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 2.725 K, and its properties provide crucial insights into the early universe's history, composition, and the formation of cosmic structures."
