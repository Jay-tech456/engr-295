    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave associated with the electron moving at a velocity of 0.8c, we will use the relativistic de Broglie wavelength equation:\n\nλ = h / (m * v * γ)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), v is the velocity of the electron, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2.4 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow we can find the wavelength using the relativistic de Broglie wavelength equation:\n\nλ = h / (m * v * γ)\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / ((9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (2.4 x 10^8 m/s) * 1.667)\nλ ≈ 1.528 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave associated with the electron moving at a velocity of 0.8c is approximately 1.528 x 10^-12 meters."
