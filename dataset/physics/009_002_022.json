The angle of incidence of light from the fish to the student's eye is 30 degrees, and the refractive index of water is 1.33. Calculate the angle the light bends as it enters the air from the water.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle the light bends as it enters the air from the water, we can use Snell's Law. Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (θ₁) to the sine of the angle of refraction (θ₂) is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media (n₁ and n₂).\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(θ₂)\n\nIn this case, the angle of incidence (θ₁) is 30 degrees, the refractive index of water (n₁) is 1.33, and the refractive index of air (n₂) is approximately 1. We want to find the angle of refraction (θ₂).\n\n1.33 * sin(30°) = 1 * sin(θ₂)\n\nTo find the sine of 30 degrees, we can use a calculator:\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5\n\nNow, substitute the value back into the equation:\n\n1.33 * 0.5 = sin(θ₂)\n\n0.665 = sin(θ₂)\n\nTo find the angle of refraction (θ₂), we need to take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.665:\n\nθ₂ = arcsin(0.665)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ₂ ≈ 41.8°\n\nSo, the angle the light bends as it enters the air from the water is approximately 41.8 degrees."
