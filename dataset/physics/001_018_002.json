    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum distance for a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol based on single photons, we need to consider the channel loss and the detection efficiency.\n\nThe channel loss is given as 0.2 dB/km. In QKD, the loss is usually expressed in terms of the transmittance (T), which is the fraction of photons that reach the receiver after traveling through the channel. The relationship between transmittance and loss (L) in dB is given by:\n\nL = -10 * log10(T)\n\nRearranging for T:\n\nT = 10^(-L/10)\n\nFor a loss of 0.2 dB/km:\n\nT = 10^(-0.2/10) ≈ 0.9772\n\nThis means that about 97.72% of the photons reach the receiver after traveling 1 km.\n\nThe detection efficiency (η) is given as 25% or 0.25. This means that only 25% of the photons that reach the receiver are actually detected.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall efficiency of the system, which is the product of the transmittance and the detection efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = T * η\n\nFor our case:\n\nEfficiency = 0.9772 * 0.25 ≈ 0.2443\n\nThe overall efficiency is about 24.43%.\n\nIn QKD, the maximum distance is usually limited by the rate at which secure key bits can be generated. As the distance increases, the overall efficiency decreases, and the secure key rate drops. At some point, the secure key rate becomes too low to be practical.\n\nA commonly used threshold for the secure key rate is when the overall efficiency drops below 50% of the initial value. In our case, this threshold would be:\n\nThreshold = 0.5 * 0.2443 ≈ 0.12215\n\nTo find the maximum distance (D) at which the overall efficiency drops to this threshold, we can use the following equation:\n\nThreshold = T^D * η\n\nRearranging for D:\n\nD = log(Threshold/η) / log(T)\n\nFor our case:\n\nD = log(0.12215/0.25) / log(0.9772) ≈ 104.7 km\n\nSo, the theoretical maximum distance that can be achieved using a quantum key distribution protocol based on single photons with the given channel loss and detection efficiency is approximately 104.7 km."
