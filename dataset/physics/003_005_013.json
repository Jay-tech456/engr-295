    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying a current (I) at a point located a distance (r) away from the wire is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment of wire, θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the line connecting the wire segment to the point, and r is the distance from the wire segment to the point.\n\nSince the wire is straight and perpendicular to the plane of the paper, the angle θ is 90 degrees for all segments of the wire, and sinθ = 1. The distance r is constant at 5 cm (0.05 m) for all segments of the wire.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field (B) at the point, we need to integrate the magnetic field produced by each small segment of the wire over the entire length of the wire (2 meters):\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) * ∫dl (from 0 to 2 meters)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (4 * π * (0.05 m)²) * 2 m\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (π * 0.0025 m²) * 2 m\n\nB = (32 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.0025\n\nB ≈ 0.000128 T or 128 μT\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the wire is approximately 128 μT."
