    "message_1": "What percentage of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy, and how can their presence be inferred through various astronomical observations and experiments?",
    "message_2": "Current observations and measurements suggest that the universe's composition consists of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter (baryonic matter, which includes stars, planets, and everything we can directly observe).\n\nThe presence of dark matter and dark energy can be inferred through various astronomical observations and experiments, such as:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its gravitational influence can be observed by the way it bends light from distant galaxies. This bending of light, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to map the distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation of galaxies show that they rotate faster than can be accounted for by the visible matter within them. This discrepancy suggests the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB reveal slight temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the presence of dark matter and dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of these structures, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\n5. Supernovae observations: Observations of distant Type Ia supernovae have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This acceleration cannot be explained by the presence of matter alone and is attributed to the repulsive force of dark energy.\n\n6. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO): BAO are fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe, caused by acoustic density waves in the early universe. These oscillations can be used as a \"standard ruler\" to measure the expansion history of the universe and provide evidence for the presence of dark energy.\n\nIn summary, while dark matter and dark energy cannot be directly observed, their presence can be inferred through various astronomical observations and experiments that study the behavior of galaxies, the distribution of matter in the universe, and the expansion of the universe itself."
