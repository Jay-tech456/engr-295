    "message_1": "A beam of light is traveling from air to a transparent material with an index of refraction of 1.5. What is the critical angle in degrees, beyond which the light is completely reflected back into the air?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the index of refraction of air (approximately 1), and n2 is the index of refraction of the transparent material (1.5). The critical angle (θc) occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(θc) = 1.5 * sin(90°)\n\nsin(θc) = 1.5 * 1\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse sine (arcsin) of the value:\n\nθc = arcsin(1/1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle is approximately 41.81 degrees. Beyond this angle, the light will be completely reflected back into the air."
