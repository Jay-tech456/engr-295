    "message_2": "Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. It has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its remarkable electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. One of the most interesting properties of graphene is its high electrical conductivity, which is influenced by temperature.\n\nThe electrical conductivity of graphene is mainly determined by two factors: the charge carrier concentration (number of electrons or holes available for conduction) and the carrier mobility (how easily these charge carriers can move through the material). Both of these factors are affected by temperature.\n\n1. Charge carrier concentration: In intrinsic graphene (pure graphene without any impurities or defects), the charge carrier concentration is determined by the thermal excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. As the temperature increases, more electrons are thermally excited, leading to an increase in the charge carrier concentration. However, in practice, graphene samples often contain impurities and defects that can act as dopants, introducing additional charge carriers. The effect of temperature on the charge carrier concentration in doped graphene can be more complex, depending on the type and concentration of dopants.\n\n2. Carrier mobility: The mobility of charge carriers in graphene is affected by various scattering mechanisms, such as lattice vibrations (phonons), impurities, and defects. At low temperatures, the dominant scattering mechanism is usually impurity and defect scattering, while at higher temperatures, phonon scattering becomes more significant. As the temperature increases, the lattice vibrations become more pronounced, leading to increased phonon scattering and a decrease in carrier mobility.\n\nConsidering both factors, the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of graphene can be described as follows:\n\n- At low temperatures, the conductivity is mainly limited by impurity and defect scattering. In this regime, the conductivity may either increase or decrease with temperature, depending on the specific type and concentration of impurities and defects present in the sample.\n\n- At intermediate temperatures, the conductivity may exhibit a peak as the increasing charge carrier concentration due to thermal excitation compensates for the decreasing carrier mobility caused by phonon scattering.\n\n- At high temperatures, the conductivity is dominated by phonon scattering, and it generally decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of graphene is determined by the interplay between charge carrier concentration and carrier mobility, both of which are influenced by temperature. The specific temperature dependence of conductivity can vary depending on the presence of impurities and defects in the graphene sample. In general, the conductivity of graphene tends to decrease with increasing temperature due to the dominant effect of phonon scattering at high temperatures."
