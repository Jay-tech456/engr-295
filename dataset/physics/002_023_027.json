    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water in the container, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and heat of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nWe are given the heat of vaporization for water (40.7 kJ/mol) and the temperature of the water in the container (50°C). We need to find the vapor pressure of water at this temperature (P2). We will use the vapor pressure of water at its boiling point (100°C) as a reference point (P1). At the boiling point, the vapor pressure of water is equal to the atmospheric pressure.\n\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K (convert to Kelvin)\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K (convert to Kelvin)\nP1 = 101.3 kPa (atmospheric pressure)\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol (convert to Joules)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.3 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 12.33 kPa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water in the container at 50°C is approximately 12.33 kPa."
