    "message_2": "Cooling has a significant effect on the magnetic properties of a superconductor. As a superconductor is cooled, it undergoes a phase transition at a specific temperature called the critical temperature (Tc). Below this temperature, the superconductor exhibits zero electrical resistance and expels magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This expulsion of magnetic fields is due to the formation of superconducting currents on the surface of the material, which generate an opposing magnetic field that cancels out the external magnetic field.\n\nThe critical temperature (Tc) is a characteristic property of a superconducting material and depends on its composition and structure. When the temperature is above Tc, the material behaves as a normal conductor, with finite electrical resistance and no expulsion of magnetic fields. As the temperature is lowered and approaches Tc, the electrical resistance decreases, and the material becomes more susceptible to magnetic fields. Once the temperature goes below Tc, the material enters the superconducting state, exhibiting zero electrical resistance and expelling magnetic fields.\n\nThe critical magnetic field (Hc) is another important parameter for superconductors. It is the maximum external magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand while remaining in the superconducting state. If the external magnetic field exceeds Hc, the superconductor will revert to its normal conducting state, with finite electrical resistance. The critical magnetic field is temperature-dependent and generally increases as the temperature decreases. At the critical temperature (Tc), the critical magnetic field is zero, and it increases as the temperature is lowered further.\n\nIn summary, as a superconductor is cooled, its critical temperature and critical magnetic field change in the following ways:\n\n1. The material undergoes a phase transition at the critical temperature (Tc), below which it exhibits zero electrical resistance and expels magnetic fields.\n2. The critical magnetic field (Hc) increases as the temperature decreases, with Hc being zero at Tc and increasing as the temperature is lowered further."
