    "message_2": "The energy released during the fission of one Uranium-235 nucleus is given as 200 MeV (Mega-electron volts). To convert this energy to a more common unit, such as Joules, we can use the following conversion:\n\n1 eV (electron volt) = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J (Joules)\n\nSo, for 200 MeV:\n\n200 MeV = 200 x 10^6 eV\n\nNow, converting to Joules:\n\nEnergy released = (200 x 10^6 eV) x (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV)\n\nEnergy released â‰ˆ 3.204 x 10^(-11) J\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy released when a nucleus of Uranium-235 undergoes fission and splits into two smaller nuclei is approximately 3.204 x 10^(-11) Joules."
