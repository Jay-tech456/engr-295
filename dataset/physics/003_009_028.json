    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a sphere carrying a current uniformly distributed throughout its volume, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a sphere with a uniformly distributed current, we can consider a small volume element (dV) within the sphere. The current density (J) is the current per unit volume. Since the current is uniformly distributed, the current density is constant throughout the sphere.\n\nJ = I_total / V\n\nwhere V is the volume of the sphere, and I_total is the total current.\n\nThe volume of the sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nFor the given problem, the radius r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, and the total current I_total = 3 A. Let's calculate the volume and current density:\n\nV = (4/3)π(0.05)³ ≈ 5.24 × 10⁻⁴ m³\n\nJ = 3 A / 5.24 × 10⁻⁴ m³ ≈ 5725.1 A/m³\n\nNow, let's consider a small volume element (dV) at a distance r from the center of the sphere. The magnetic field produced by this volume element at the center of the sphere is dB. The contribution of the magnetic field dB is perpendicular to the plane formed by the position vector (r) and the area vector (dA) of the volume element.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at the center, we need to integrate the magnetic field contributions from all the volume elements within the sphere. Due to symmetry, the magnetic field contributions in the radial direction will cancel out, and only the magnetic field contributions along the vertical direction will add up.\n\nLet's consider a small area element dA on the surface of the sphere at an angle θ from the vertical axis. The vertical component of the magnetic field dB_vertical is given by:\n\ndB_vertical = (dB * sinθ)\n\nThe current enclosed by the area element dA is:\n\ndI = J * dV = J * r² * sinθ * dθ * dϕ * dr\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the vertical component of the magnetic field:\n\ndB_vertical = (μ₀ * dI) / (4πr²)\n\nSubstituting the expression for dI, we get:\n\ndB_vertical = (μ₀ * J * r² * sinθ * dθ * dϕ * dr) / (4πr²)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire volume of the sphere to find the total vertical component of the magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_vertical = ∫∫∫ dB_vertical\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the vertical direction, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB_vertical = (μ₀ * J) * ∫∫∫(sinθ * dθ * dϕ * dr) / (4π)\n\nThe limits of integration are 0 to 2π for ϕ, 0 to π for θ, and 0 to R (radius of the sphere) for r:\n\nB_vertical = (μ₀ * J) * [∫(sinθ * dθ) from 0 to π] * [∫dϕ from 0 to 2π] * [∫dr from 0 to R] / (4π)\n\nEvaluating the integrals, we get:\n\nB_vertical = (μ₀ * J) * [(-cosπ + cos0)] * [2π] * [R] / (4π)\n\nB_vertical = (μ₀ * J * R) / 2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀ (permeability of free space = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), J, and R:\n\nB_vertical = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5725.1 A/m³ * 0.05 m) / 2\n\nB_vertical ≈ 1.81 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the sphere is approximately 1.81 × 10⁻⁵ T."
