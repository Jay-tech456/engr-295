    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, alpha particles are scattered by the Coulomb force from the positively charged gold nucleus. The minimum angle of deflection, θ_min, occurs when the alpha particle comes closest to the nucleus, which is called the distance of closest approach, R_min.\n\nTo find the minimum angle of deflection, we can use the formula for R_min:\n\nR_min = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K.E.)\n\nwhere k is the Coulomb constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the alpha particle and gold nucleus, and K.E. is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nThe charge of an alpha particle (q1) is 2 times the elementary charge, so q1 = 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C = 3.2 x 10^-19 C. The gold nucleus has 79 protons, so its charge (q2) is 79 times the elementary charge, q2 = 79 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C = 1.264 x 10^-17 C. The kinetic energy of the alpha particle is given as 5 MeV, which is equivalent to 5 x 10^6 eV * 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV = 8 x 10^-13 J.\n\nNow we can calculate R_min:\n\nR_min = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2 * 3.2 x 10^-19 C * 1.264 x 10^-17 C) / (2 * 8 x 10^-13 J)\nR_min ≈ 1.44 x 10^-14 m\n\nNow we can find the minimum angle of deflection, θ_min, using the formula:\n\nθ_min = 2 * arctan((b / R_min))\n\nwhere b is the impact parameter, which is the perpendicular distance between the alpha particle's initial trajectory and the center of the gold nucleus. For minimum deflection, b = R_min.\n\nθ_min = 2 * arctan((1.44 x 10^-14 m) / (1.44 x 10^-14 m))\nθ_min = 2 * arctan(1)\n\nθ_min ≈ 2 * 45° = 90°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of deflection produced in the Rutherford scattering experiment for a gold nucleus bombarded with alpha particles having energy 5 MeV is approximately 90°."
