    "message_2": "To calculate the expected recoil energy of a xenon nucleus, we can use the formula for the maximum recoil energy (E_R) in an elastic collision between a dark matter particle (mass m_chi) and a target nucleus (mass m_N):\n\nE_R = (4 * m_chi * m_N) / (m_chi + m_N)^2 * v^2\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the dark matter particle and the xenon nucleus.\n\nGiven the mass of the dark matter particle (m_chi) is 100 GeV/c², we need to convert it to kg:\n\nm_chi = 100 GeV/c² * (1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/GeV) / (2.99792 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nm_chi ≈ 1.7827 × 10⁻²⁵ kg\n\nThe mass of a xenon nucleus (m_N) can be calculated using its atomic mass (A = 131) and the atomic mass unit (u = 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n\nm_N = 131 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\nm_N ≈ 2.1753 × 10⁻²⁵ kg\n\nAssuming a typical relative velocity (v) of 220 km/s for dark matter particles in the Milky Way:\n\nv = 220 × 10³ m/s\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum recoil energy (E_R):\n\nE_R = (4 * 1.7827 × 10⁻²⁵ kg * 2.1753 × 10⁻²⁵ kg) / (1.7827 × 10⁻²⁵ kg + 2.1753 × 10⁻²⁵ kg)² * (220 × 10³ m/s)²\nE_R ≈ 2.045 × 10⁻²¹ J\n\nTo convert the recoil energy to keV:\n\nE_R = 2.045 × 10⁻²¹ J * (1 eV / 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) * (1 keV / 1000 eV)\nE_R ≈ 12.77 keV\n\nThe expected maximum recoil energy of a xenon nucleus interacting with a 100 GeV/c² dark matter particle is approximately 12.77 keV. However, this is the maximum possible recoil energy, and the actual recoil energy distribution will depend on the specific dark matter model and the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. The detector threshold of 3 keV means that only events with a recoil energy above 3 keV will be detected."
