    "message_2": "To determine the theoretical maximum frequency of gravitational waves emitted from a population of primordial black holes in the Milky Way galaxy, we need to consider the smallest possible primordial black holes and their properties.\n\nThe smallest primordial black holes are expected to have masses around the Planck mass (M_P), which is approximately 2.2 x 10^(-8) kg. The size of a black hole is determined by its Schwarzschild radius (R_S), which is given by:\n\nR_S = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. For a black hole with a mass of the Planck mass, the Schwarzschild radius is approximately the Planck length (L_P), which is around 1.6 x 10^(-35) meters.\n\nNow, let's consider the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a pair of primordial black holes in a binary system. The frequency of the emitted gravitational waves (f_GW) is twice the orbital frequency (f_orb) of the binary system. The orbital frequency can be estimated using Kepler's third law:\n\nf_orb = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes, and a is the semi-major axis of their orbit. In the case of two primordial black holes with masses around the Planck mass, we can assume M1 = M2 = M_P, and the semi-major axis a is approximately equal to the sum of their Schwarzschild radii (2 * R_S).\n\nUsing these assumptions, we can estimate the maximum frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system of primordial black holes:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orb = (1 / pi) * sqrt(G * (2 * M_P) / (4 * R_S)^3)\n\nPlugging in the values for G, M_P, and R_S, we get:\n\nf_GW â‰ˆ 3.3 x 10^43 Hz\n\nThis is an extremely high frequency, and it is far beyond the sensitivity range of current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, which are sensitive to frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to a few kHz.\n\nTo detect gravitational waves with such high frequencies, we would need detectors with a minimum sensitivity on the order of 10^(-44) Hz^(-1/2) or better. This is currently far beyond our technological capabilities, and it is unclear if such a detector could ever be built. However, future advancements in technology and new detection methods may allow us to probe these extremely high-frequency gravitational waves and learn more about primordial black holes and the early universe."
