    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass (1000 kg), v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.9c), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.9c)^2 / c^2 = 0.81\n\nNow, we can find the value of 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19\n\nNext, we can find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.4359\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1000 kg / 0.4359 ≈ 2293.7 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 2293.7 kg."
