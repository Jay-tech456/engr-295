    "message_1": "What is the critical angle of incidence when a light ray travels from a medium with an index of refraction of 1.5 to a medium with an index of refraction of 1.2, and experiences total internal reflection? Given that the speed of light in a vacuum is 3 x 10^8 m/s, determine the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection of the light ray.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the product of the index of refraction and the sine of the angle of incidence in one medium is equal to the product of the index of refraction and the sine of the angle of refraction in the other medium. In the case of total internal reflection, the angle of refraction is 90 degrees.\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (1.5), θ1 is the critical angle of incidence, n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium (1.2), and θ2 is the angle of refraction (90 degrees).\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1.2 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1.2\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle of incidence (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.2 / 1.5\nsin(θ1) = 0.8\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.8)\nθ1 ≈ 53.13°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence is approximately 53.13 degrees.\n\nFor total internal reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the critical angle, and the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. Therefore, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are both approximately 53.13 degrees."
