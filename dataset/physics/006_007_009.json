    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of mercury atoms. This energy difference corresponds to the minimum accelerating voltage required to observe the first excited state transition in the Franck-Hertz experiment.\n\nThe energy levels of mercury are given by the following values:\n\nGround state energy (E1): 0 eV\nFirst excited state energy (E2): 4.9 eV\n\nThe energy difference between these two states is:\n\nΔE = E2 - E1 = 4.9 eV - 0 eV = 4.9 eV\n\nNow, we need to convert this energy difference into the minimum accelerating voltage (V) required to observe the first excited state transition. We can use the following equation:\n\nΔE = e * V\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C).\n\nSolving for V, we get:\n\nV = ΔE / e = 4.9 eV / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C/eV) = 3.06 × 10^(-19) J / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) = 3.06 / 1.6 V ≈ 1.91 V\n\nTherefore, the minimum accelerating voltage required to observe the first excited state transition in mercury atoms during the Franck-Hertz experiment is approximately 1.91 V."
