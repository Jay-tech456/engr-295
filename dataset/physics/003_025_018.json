    "message_1": "A copper wire with a diameter of 1 mm carries a current of 5 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire assuming the wire is a resistor with a resistance of 10 ohms.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. In this case, we will use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current (5 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (2 cm = 0.02 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) T) / 0.02 m\n\nB = 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire is 10^(-4) Tesla or 100 μT."
