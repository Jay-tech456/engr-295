    "message_1": "A physics student is designing a communication system that uses optical fibers. The system has two separate fibers, each with a core diameter of 50 μm and a numerical aperture of 0.2. One fiber is used to transmit a signal, and the other is used to transmit a reference signal. The transmitted signal is encoded with a data rate of 10 Gbps. The system has an overall attenuation of 2 dB/km at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Calculate the maximum transmission distance of the communication system.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum transmission distance of the communication system, we need to determine the maximum allowable signal loss. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nMaximum allowable signal loss (dB) = 10 * log10 (Signal power / Minimum detectable power)\n\nFor a 10 Gbps data rate, the minimum detectable power is typically around -28 dBm. Assuming the signal power is 0 dBm, we can calculate the maximum allowable signal loss:\n\nMaximum allowable signal loss (dB) = 10 * log10 (1 / 0.00158) ≈ 28 dB\n\nNow, we can use the attenuation value to determine the maximum transmission distance. The formula for this is:\n\nMaximum transmission distance (km) = Maximum allowable signal loss (dB) / Attenuation (dB/km)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nMaximum transmission distance (km) = 28 dB / 2 dB/km = 14 km\n\nTherefore, the maximum transmission distance of the communication system is 14 kilometers."
