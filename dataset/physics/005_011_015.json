    "message_1": "A spaceship is travelling towards Earth at 75% of the speed of light. If its rest mass is 5,000 kg, what is its relativistic mass?",
    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 5,000 kg\nv = 0.75c\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.75c)^2 / c^2 = 0.5625\n\nNow, we can calculate the denominator of the equation:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375)\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 5,000 kg / sqrt(0.4375) â‰ˆ 7,573.21 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 7,573.21 kg."
