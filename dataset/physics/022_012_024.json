    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the Universe and has a significant gravitational influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.\n\nDark matter contributes to the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe through the following processes:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter, like ordinary matter, exerts gravitational forces. Due to its abundance, dark matter's gravity attracts both itself and ordinary matter, causing them to clump together. These clumps eventually form the seeds for the development of large-scale structures such as galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters.\n\n2. Cosmic web: The distribution of dark matter forms a cosmic web-like structure throughout the Universe. This web consists of dense regions connected by filaments and surrounded by vast, empty voids. The dense regions of dark matter attract ordinary matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters along the filaments.\n\n3. Dark matter halos: Dark matter is believed to form halos around galaxies, providing additional gravitational support for the visible matter within the galaxy. These halos help to stabilize galaxies and promote the formation of stars and other structures.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures:\n\n1. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: Observations of the CMB, the afterglow of the Big Bang, reveal tiny fluctuations in temperature. These fluctuations correspond to the initial density perturbations that eventually led to the formation of large-scale structures. Theoretical models that include dark matter provide the best fit to the observed CMB data.\n\n2. Large-scale structure surveys: Surveys of the distribution of galaxies in the Universe show a web-like pattern consistent with the presence of dark matter. The observed distribution of galaxies can be accurately modeled by incorporating dark matter into simulations of cosmic structure formation.\n\n3. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter's gravitational influence can bend the path of light from distant objects, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects around galaxy clusters provide strong evidence for the presence of dark matter and its role in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe.\n\n4. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars in galaxies reveal that the visible matter alone cannot account for the observed velocities. The presence of dark matter halos surrounding galaxies can explain these rotation curves, further supporting the role of dark matter in the formation of cosmic structures.\n\nIn conclusion, the distribution of dark matter plays a critical role in the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe. Its gravitational influence helps to shape the cosmic web, stabilize galaxies, and promote the development of galaxy clusters and superclusters. Multiple lines of evidence, including CMB observations, large-scale structure surveys, gravitational lensing, and galaxy rotation curves, support the theory of dark matter's involvement in cosmic structure formation."
