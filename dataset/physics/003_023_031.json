    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current (I) passing through the loop. The formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nI = 10 A\nN = 200 turns\nR = 0.3 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A * 200) / (2 * 0.3 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-6) Tm * 200) / 0.6 m\n\nB = (1600π × 10^(-6) T) / 0.6\n\nB ≈ (1600π × 10^(-6) T) / 0.6 ≈ 8.377 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current is approximately 8.377 × 10^(-3) T (tesla)."
