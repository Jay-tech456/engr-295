    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection within a fiber optic cable, we need to use the concept of critical angle. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the fiber optic cable (1.45), n2 is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (usually air, with a refractive index of approximately 1), θ1 is the angle of incidence (which we want to find), and θ2 is the angle of refraction (90 degrees for total internal reflection).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the angle of incidence, we get:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°) / 1.45\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.45\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.45)\n\nCalculating the arcsin:\n\nθ1 ≈ 43.6°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for a beam of light to totally reflect within a fiber optic cable with a refractive index of 1.45 is approximately 43.6 degrees."
