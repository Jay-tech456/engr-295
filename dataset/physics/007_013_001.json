    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during the fusion of four helium atoms into a carbon atom, we need to consider the mass difference between the initial reactants (helium atoms) and the final product (carbon atom) and use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², where E is the energy, m is the mass difference, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the reactants and products:\n\n1. Mass of a helium atom (He-4) = 4.002603 u (unified atomic mass units)\n2. Mass of a carbon atom (C-12) = 12.000000 u\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass difference:\n\nMass of 4 helium atoms = 4 * 4.002603 u = 16.010412 u\nMass difference = Mass of 4 helium atoms - Mass of 1 carbon atom\nMass difference = 16.010412 u - 12.000000 u = 4.010412 u\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units to kilograms:\n\n1 u = 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\nMass difference = 4.010412 u * 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/u = 6.661409 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation to find the energy released:\n\nE = mc²\nE = (6.661409 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nE ≈ 5.986 × 10⁻¹² Joules\n\nSo, the energy released during the fusion of four helium atoms into a carbon atom in the core of a star is approximately 5.986 × 10⁻¹² Joules."
