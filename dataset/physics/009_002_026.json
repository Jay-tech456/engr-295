    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the beam of light travels from air into water. The refractive index of air is approximately 1, and the refractive index of water is given as 1.33. The angle of incidence (θ1) is 30 degrees. We need to find the angle of refraction (θ2).\n\nUsing Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.33\n\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.3759\n\nTo find the angle of refraction, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of this value:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3759)\n\nθ2 ≈ 22.09°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 22.09 degrees."
