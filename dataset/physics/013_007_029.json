    "message_2": "To estimate the expected rotational velocity of a star orbiting near the edge of the visible disk of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use the following equation for the orbital velocity of an object in a circular orbit around a massive body:\n\nv = √(GM/R)\n\nwhere v is the orbital velocity, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy within the orbit of the star, and R is the distance from the center of the galaxy to the star.\n\nThe mass of the Milky Way galaxy within the orbit of the star can be estimated using the mass-to-light ratio, which is the ratio of the mass of a galaxy to its luminosity. For the Milky Way, the mass-to-light ratio is about 5 solar masses per solar luminosity. The luminosity of the Milky Way is about 2 x 10^10 solar luminosities, so the mass within the orbit of the star can be estimated as:\n\nM = (5 solar masses/solar luminosity) x (2 x 10^10 solar luminosities) = 10^11 solar masses\n\nTo convert this mass to kilograms, we can use the mass of the Sun, which is about 1.989 x 10^30 kg:\n\nM = (10^11 solar masses) x (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 1.989 x 10^41 kg\n\nThe distance from the center of the galaxy to the star, R, can be estimated as the radius of the visible disk of the Milky Way, which is about 50,000 light-years. To convert this distance to meters, we can use the speed of light, which is about 3 x 10^8 m/s:\n\nR = (50,000 light-years) x (9.461 x 10^15 m/light-year) = 4.7305 x 10^20 m\n\nNow we can calculate the expected rotational velocity of the star:\n\nv = √((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) x (1.989 x 10^41 kg) / (4.7305 x 10^20 m))\nv ≈ 2.2 x 10^5 m/s\n\nSo, the expected rotational velocity of a star orbiting near the edge of the visible disk of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 220,000 m/s, or 220 km/s. This is a rough estimate and can vary depending on the specific location of the star and the distribution of mass within the galaxy."
