    "message_2": "To determine the temperature at which a ferroelectric crystal loses its spontaneous polarization, we can use the Curie-Weiss law. The Curie-Weiss law describes the relationship between the spontaneous polarization (P) and the temperature (T) of a ferroelectric material:\n\nP(T) = P0 * (1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nwhere P0 is the spontaneous polarization at 0 K, Tc is the Curie temperature, and β is the critical exponent (typically between 0.25 and 0.5).\n\nGiven the experimentally measured remnant polarization values and the known Curie temperature, we can find the temperature at which the spontaneous polarization becomes zero by solving the equation P(T) = 0:\n\n0 = P0 * (1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nTo solve for T, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nT/Tc = 1 - (0/P0)^(1/β)\n\nSince 0/P0 = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nT/Tc = 1\n\nThus, T = Tc\n\nSo, the temperature at which a ferroelectric crystal loses its spontaneous polarization is equal to its Curie temperature."
