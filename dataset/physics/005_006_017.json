    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by light traveling from Earth's surface to the edge of the observable universe, we need to consider the redshift due to Earth's gravity and the cosmological redshift due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the gravitational redshift due to Earth's gravity. The formula for gravitational redshift is:\n\nz_grav = (1 - 2GM/c^2R)^(1/2) - 1\n\nwhere z_grav is the gravitational redshift, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of Earth (5.972 x 10^24 kg), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the radius of Earth (6.371 x 10^6 m).\n\nz_grav = (1 - 2(6.67430 x 10^-11)(5.972 x 10^24) / ((2.998 x 10^8)^2(6.371 x 10^6)))^(1/2) - 1\nz_grav ≈ 6.95 x 10^-10\n\nNow, let's consider the cosmological redshift due to the expansion of the universe. The edge of the observable universe is about 46.5 billion light-years away. The current redshift value for the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), which is the farthest observable distance, is about z_cosmo ≈ 1100.\n\nTo find the total redshift experienced by light traveling from Earth's surface to the edge of the observable universe, we need to add the gravitational redshift and the cosmological redshift. Since the gravitational redshift is very small compared to the cosmological redshift, the total redshift is approximately equal to the cosmological redshift:\n\nz_total ≈ z_cosmo + z_grav ≈ 1100\n\nSo, the gravitational redshift experienced by light traveling from Earth's surface to the edge of the observable universe is approximately 1100."
