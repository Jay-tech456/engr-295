    "message_2": "The evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter primarily comes from the gravitational effects of dark matter on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, it is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. Here are some key pieces of evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant objects as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations of gravitational lensing reveal that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the distribution of matter at that time. The observed patterns in the CMB are consistent with the presence of dark matter, which would have affected the distribution of normal matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the gravitational effects of dark matter. Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structures show that the presence of dark matter is necessary to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nScientists study the interaction between dark matter and normal matter using a variety of methods, including:\n\n1. Observational astronomy: Astronomers use telescopes and other instruments to observe the effects of dark matter on visible matter, such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing.\n\n2. Cosmological simulations: Computer simulations are used to model the formation and evolution of the universe, including the role of dark matter in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n3. Particle physics experiments: Scientists are searching for direct evidence of dark matter particles through experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and various underground detectors. These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles by observing their interactions with normal matter.\n\n4. Indirect detection: Researchers also search for indirect evidence of dark matter by looking for signals of dark matter annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or other high-energy particles.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter comes from various astronomical observations and theoretical models. Scientists study this interaction through a combination of observational astronomy, cosmological simulations, and particle physics experiments."
