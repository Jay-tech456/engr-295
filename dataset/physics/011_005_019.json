    "message_2": "The relationship between saturation magnetization (Ms) and temperature (T) in a ferromagnetic material can be described by the Curie-Weiss law. According to this law, the saturation magnetization decreases as the temperature increases and becomes zero at a critical temperature called the Curie temperature (Tc).\n\nThe Curie-Weiss law can be expressed as:\n\nMs(T) = Ms(0) * (1 - (T/Tc))^β\n\nwhere:\n- Ms(T) is the saturation magnetization at temperature T,\n- Ms(0) is the saturation magnetization at absolute zero temperature (0 K),\n- Tc is the Curie temperature,\n- β is the critical exponent, which is typically close to 0.5 for most ferromagnetic materials.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments of the atoms in the material to become more randomly oriented, which reduces the overall magnetization. When the temperature reaches the Curie temperature, the thermal energy overcomes the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments, and the material loses its ferromagnetic properties, becoming paramagnetic."
