    "message_2": "In Rutherford scattering, an alpha particle (helium nucleus) is scattered by a gold nucleus due to the electrostatic repulsion between the two charged particles. To find the minimum distance between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus, we can use the following formula:\n\nd_min = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * E_inc * (1 - cos(θ)))\n\nwhere:\n- d_min is the minimum distance between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus\n- k is the electrostatic constant (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2)\n- q1 is the charge of the alpha particle (2 * e, where e is the elementary charge, 1.602 × 10^-19 C)\n- q2 is the charge of the gold nucleus (Z * e, where Z is the atomic number of gold, 79)\n- E_inc is the incident kinetic energy of the alpha particle\n- θ is the scattering angle\n\nNote that this formula assumes that the gold nucleus is stationary, which is a reasonable approximation for Rutherford scattering experiments."
