    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs (alpha_s), is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the strength of the strong nuclear force in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. This means that the strength of the strong force decreases as the energy scale (or the momentum transfer) between interacting particles increases.\n\nThe current world-average value of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (MZ ≈ 91.2 GeV) is αs(MZ) ≈ 0.1181, with an uncertainty of around ±0.0011. This value is obtained by averaging the results from various experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.\n\nThere are several methods to measure the strong coupling constant, including:\n\n1. Deep inelastic scattering: This involves scattering high-energy electrons or muons off nucleons (protons or neutrons) and measuring the distribution of the scattered particles. The data can be used to extract the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the nucleons, which are related to αs.\n\n2. Hadron collider experiments: Measurements of cross-sections and event shapes in high-energy proton-proton or proton-antiproton collisions can be used to determine αs. For example, the production rates of jets (collimated sprays of particles) in these collisions are sensitive to the strong coupling constant.\n\n3. Lattice QCD calculations: These are numerical simulations of QCD on a discrete spacetime lattice, which allow for non-perturbative calculations of various quantities, including αs.\n\n4. Heavy quarkonia: The energy levels and decay rates of bound states of heavy quarks (such as charmonium and bottomonium) can be used to extract αs.\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the measurement of the strong coupling constant arise from various sources, including:\n\n1. Experimental uncertainties: These include statistical uncertainties due to the finite size of the data samples, as well as systematic uncertainties related to the detector performance, background estimation, and other experimental aspects.\n\n2. Theoretical uncertainties: These arise from the truncation of the perturbative QCD series, uncertainties in the PDFs, and other theoretical inputs.\n\n3. Scale dependence: Since αs depends on the energy scale, the choice of the renormalization scale introduces an uncertainty in its determination.\n\n4. Non-perturbative effects: Some of the methods used to extract αs rely on perturbative QCD calculations, which may not be valid at low energy scales where non-perturbative effects become important.\n\nOverall, the determination of the strong coupling constant is a complex task that involves combining results from various experimental and theoretical approaches, taking into account the different sources of uncertainties. The current precision of αs(MZ) is at the level of about 1%, which is a remarkable achievement given the complexity of the strong force and the challenges associated with its measurement."
