    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino\n- θ is the mixing angle between the two neutrino flavors (in this case, 30 degrees)\n- Δm² is the difference in the squared masses of the two neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²)\n- L is the distance the neutrino travels (in km)\n- E is the initial energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mixing angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30° * (π / 180°) ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nNext, we need the value of Δm². The current best-fit value for the atmospheric mass-squared difference (which is relevant for muon and electron neutrino oscillations) is:\n\nΔm² ≈ 2.5 × 10⁻³ eV²\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.5236) * sin²(1.27 * 2.5 × 10⁻³ * 500 / 2)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.25 * sin²(0.7975)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.25 * 0.4993\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.1248\n\nSo the probability of a muon neutrino with an initial energy of 2 GeV oscillating into an electron neutrino after travelling a distance of 500 km through the Earth's crust is approximately 12.48%."
