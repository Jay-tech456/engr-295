    "message_2": "To calculate the increase in mass of a particle when it is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to use the concept of relativistic mass. The relativistic mass (m) is given by the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass of the particle, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, the rest mass (m0) is 10 kg, and the velocity (v) is 0.8c. We can plug these values into the equation to find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = 10 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nm = 10 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm = 10 kg / sqrt(0.36)\nm = 10 kg / 0.6\nm ≈ 16.67 kg\n\nNow, to find the increase in mass, we subtract the rest mass from the relativistic mass:\n\nΔm = m - m0\nΔm = 16.67 kg - 10 kg\nΔm ≈ 6.67 kg\n\nSo, the increase in the mass of the particle when it is traveling at a speed of 0.8c is approximately 6.67 kg."
