The initial intensity of the light is 100mW/sq.cm. Determine the degree of polarization of the light.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the degree of polarization of the light, we can use Malus's Law. Malus's Law states that the intensity of light after passing through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²θ\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the light after passing through the polarizer, I₀ is the initial intensity of the light, and θ is the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the intensity of the resulting light is 40% of the initial intensity. Therefore, we can write:\n\nI = 0.4 * I₀\n\nWe are also given that the initial intensity of the light is 100 mW/sq.cm. So, I₀ = 100 mW/sq.cm. Now, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nI = 0.4 * 100 mW/sq.cm\nI = 40 mW/sq.cm\n\nNow, we can use Malus's Law to find the angle θ:\n\n40 mW/sq.cm = 100 mW/sq.cm * cos²θ\n\nDivide both sides by 100 mW/sq.cm:\n\n0.4 = cos²θ\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.4) = cosθ\n\ncosθ ≈ 0.6325\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ ≈ cos^(-1)(0.6325)\nθ ≈ 49.46°\n\nThe degree of polarization of the light is determined by the angle θ. In this case, the degree of polarization is approximately 49.46°."
