    "message_2": "To find the distance between the two slits in a Young's Double Slit Experiment, we can use the formula for the interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first order maximum, m is the order of the maximum (m = 1 for the first order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle θ. We can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the first order maximum (2 cm = 0.02 m), and L is the distance between the slits and the screen (1 m). Solving for θ:\n\nθ ≈ 0.02 m / 1 m = 0.02\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the interference pattern formula. We still need the wavelength of the light, λ. If the wavelength is not given, we cannot find the exact value of d. However, we can express d in terms of λ:\n\n0.02 = (1 * λ) / d\n\nRearranging to solve for d:\n\nd = λ / 0.02\n\nSo the distance between the two slits, d, is equal to the wavelength of the light divided by 0.02."
