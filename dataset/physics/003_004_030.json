    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters from the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 5 A\nR = 0.2 m\nx = 0.1 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.2 m)²) / (2 * ((0.2 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.04 m²) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.04 m²) / (2 * 0.125 m³)\n\nB = (3.2π × 10^(-7) T) / 0.125 m³\n\nB ≈ 8.03 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters from the center of the loop is approximately 8.03 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
