    "message_2": "To determine the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the Eyring equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a reaction to the activation energy (ΔG‡) and temperature (T):\n\nk = (k_B * T / h) * e^(-ΔG‡ / RT)\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) J·s), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)), and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nSince the enzyme increases the rate of the reaction by 10 times, we can write the ratio of the rate constants for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (k_cat) and the uncatalyzed reaction (k_uncat) as:\n\nk_cat / k_uncat = 10\n\nNow, we can use the Eyring equation to relate the activation energies for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions:\n\nΔG‡_cat = ΔG‡_uncat - RT * ln(10)\n\nWe don't have the values for ΔG‡_uncat and ΔG‡_cat, but we can determine the change in Gibbs free energy due to the enzyme (ΔΔG‡) as:\n\nΔΔG‡ = ΔG‡_cat - ΔG‡_uncat\n\nSubstituting the previous equation, we get:\n\nΔΔG‡ = -RT * ln(10)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for R, T, and ln(10):\n\nΔΔG‡ = -(8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (298.15 K) * ln(10)\n\nΔΔG‡ ≈ -13.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is approximately -13.8 kJ/mol."
