    "message_1": "A heat pump is used to maintain a room at 25°C when the outside temperature is 5°C. The heat pump absorbs heat from the outside air and transfers it to the room. The heat pump has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.5. If the heat pump requires 3 kW of power to function, what is the rate of heat transfer from the outside air to the room?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is the ratio of the heat transferred to the room to the work input (power) required to run the heat pump. In this case, the COP is 3.5, and the power input is 3 kW. \n\nTo find the rate of heat transfer from the outside air to the room, we can use the following formula:\n\nRate of heat transfer = COP × Power input\n\nRate of heat transfer = 3.5 × 3 kW\n\nRate of heat transfer = 10.5 kW\n\nSo, the rate of heat transfer from the outside air to the room is 10.5 kW."
