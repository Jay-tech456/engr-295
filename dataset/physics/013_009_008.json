    "message_2": "To estimate the temperature of the interstellar medium in the Orion Nebula, we can use the concept of blackbody radiation and the Wien's Displacement Law. The Orion Nebula is an emission nebula, meaning it emits light due to the ionization of the gas within it. The spectral emissions of the Orion Nebula can be used to determine the peak wavelength of its emitted light.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature (T) of the object:\n\nλ_max * T = b\n\nwhere b is Wien's constant, approximately equal to 2.898 x 10^(-3) m*K.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the peak wavelength of the spectral emissions of the Orion Nebula. The Orion Nebula is known for its strong emission lines, particularly the H-alpha line, which has a wavelength of 656.3 nm (6.563 x 10^(-7) m).\n\nNow, we can use Wien's Displacement Law to estimate the temperature:\n\nT = b / λ_max\nT = (2.898 x 10^(-3) m*K) / (6.563 x 10^(-7) m)\nT ≈ 4415 K\n\nSo, the estimated temperature of the interstellar medium in the Orion Nebula is approximately 4415 Kelvin. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual temperature may vary due to various factors such as density and the presence of different elements in the interstellar medium."
