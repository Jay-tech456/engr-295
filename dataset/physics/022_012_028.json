    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and it is estimated to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nDark matter affects the formation of large-scale structures in the following ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides additional gravitational force that attracts baryonic (normal) matter, helping to form the cosmic web of galaxy clusters and superclusters. The gravitational pull of dark matter causes gas and dust to accumulate in denser regions, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n2. Cosmic web formation: Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, a large-scale structure of interconnected filaments and voids that spans the universe. The cosmic web is composed of dark matter halos, which are regions of high dark matter density. These halos serve as the gravitational anchors for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n3. Stability of galaxies: Dark matter halos surrounding galaxies provide additional mass, which helps to stabilize the rotation of galaxies. Without dark matter, the observed rotation curves of galaxies would not match the predictions based on the visible matter alone.\n\nThere are several pieces of evidence that support the role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional mass and gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations of gravitational lensing show that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB reveal tiny fluctuations in temperature, which correspond to density fluctuations in the early universe. The observed pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the presence of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure simulations: Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, which include the effects of dark matter, produce results that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter is essential for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters. The evidence supporting this theory comes from various observations, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure simulations."
