    "message_2": "In the Mössbauer effect, when a gamma-ray photon is absorbed by a nucleus, the recoil energy is transferred to the entire crystal lattice instead of just the nucleus. If the crystal is fully clamped and there is no motion, the recoil energy is essentially zero. This is because the crystal lattice is so much more massive than the nucleus, and the energy is distributed over the entire lattice, making the recoil energy negligible.\n\nSo, the change in recoil energy of the iron-57 nucleus when a 14.4 keV gamma-ray photon is absorbed in the Mössbauer effect, assuming that the crystal containing the iron-57 nucleus is fully clamped and there is no motion, is approximately 0."
