    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two neutron stars, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere:\nf is the frequency of the gravitational waves,\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s),\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nM is the total mass of the system (in this case, the sum of the masses of the two neutron stars),\nand π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the neutron stars from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of each neutron star is:\n\n1.4 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nSince there are two neutron stars, the total mass of the system is:\n\nM = 2 * 2.7846 x 10^30 kg = 5.5692 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.5692 x 10^30 kg * π)\n\nf ≈ 1.327 x 10^24 m^3/s^3 / (3.717 x 10^20 kg m^3/s^2)\n\nf ≈ 3.57 x 10^3 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of the two neutron stars is approximately 3.57 kHz.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified calculation that assumes the neutron stars are point masses and does not take into account the complex dynamics of the merger process. In reality, the frequency of the gravitational waves would vary during the merger and would be influenced by factors such as the stars' spins and orbital eccentricity."
