    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy absorbed (500 Joules), m is the mass of copper (100 grams), c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (10 Kelvin).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\nc = 500 J / (100 g × 10 K)\n\nc = 500 J / 1000 gK\n\nc = 0.5 J/gK\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of copper is 0.5 Joules per gram Kelvin."
