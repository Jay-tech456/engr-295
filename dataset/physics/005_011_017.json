    "message_2": "First, we need to find the initial relativistic mass of the object. The relativistic mass (m) is given by the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nm0 = 10 kg\nv = 0.9c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nm_initial = 10 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nm_initial = 10 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nm_initial = 10 kg / sqrt(0.19)\nm_initial ≈ 22.91 kg\n\nNow, we need to find the final relativistic mass after the kinetic energy change. The kinetic energy (K) of a relativistic object is given by:\n\nK = (m - m0)c^2\n\nWe know the initial kinetic energy (K_initial) and the change in kinetic energy (ΔK), so we can find the final kinetic energy (K_final):\n\nK_final = K_initial + ΔK\n\nTo find K_initial, we can rearrange the kinetic energy equation:\n\nK_initial = (m_initial - m0)c^2\nK_initial = (22.91 kg - 10 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK_initial ≈ 3.49 x 10^17 J\n\nNow, we can find K_final:\n\nΔK = 2 x 10^6 J\nK_final = 3.49 x 10^17 J + 2 x 10^6 J\nK_final ≈ 3.49 x 10^17 J\n\nNow, we can find the final relativistic mass (m_final) using the kinetic energy equation:\n\nK_final = (m_final - m0)c^2\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for m_final:\n\nm_final = (K_final/c^2) + m0\nm_final = (3.49 x 10^17 J / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) + 10 kg\nm_final ≈ 22.91 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass after the kinetic energy change is approximately 22.91 kg. The change in kinetic energy was relatively small compared to the initial kinetic energy, so the relativistic mass did not change significantly."
