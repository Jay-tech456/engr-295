    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 5 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms using the solar mass constant:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nSo, the mass of the black hole in kilograms is:\n\nM = 5 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nG ≈ 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc ≈ 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nR_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ (1.327 x 10^20 kg m^3 s^-2) / (8.988 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nR_s ≈ 1.476 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14,760 meters or 14.76 kilometers."
