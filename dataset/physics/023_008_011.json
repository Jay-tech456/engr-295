    "message_1": "In quantum teleportation, a qubit (quantum bit) is transferred from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself. If two parties, Alice and Bob, share an entangled pair of qubits and Alice wants to teleport a qubit to Bob, what operation should Alice perform on her qubit and the entangled qubit she holds, and what measurement should Alice and Bob perform on their respective qubits?",
    "message_2": "In quantum teleportation, Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, usually in the Bell state. Let's denote Alice's qubits as A (the one she wants to teleport) and A' (the entangled qubit she shares with Bob), and Bob's qubit as B (the entangled qubit he shares with Alice).\n\n1. Alice performs a controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation on her qubits A and A'. This operation flips the state of A' if A is in the state |1⟩. After this operation, the combined state of A, A', and B is entangled.\n\n2. Alice then performs a Hadamard operation on her qubit A. This operation creates a superposition of the qubit states. After this operation, the combined state of A, A', and B is still entangled but now in a different form.\n\n3. Alice measures her qubits A and A' in the computational basis (|0⟩ and |1⟩ states). She obtains one of the four possible outcomes: (00), (01), (10), or (11). She then sends this classical information (two classical bits) to Bob through a classical communication channel.\n\n4. Based on the information received from Alice, Bob performs one of the following operations on his qubit B:\n   - If Alice's measurement outcome is (00), Bob does nothing (identity operation).\n   - If Alice's measurement outcome is (01), Bob applies a Pauli-X (bit-flip) operation.\n   - If Alice's measurement outcome is (10), Bob applies a Pauli-Z (phase-flip) operation.\n   - If Alice's measurement outcome is (11), Bob applies both Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operations.\n\nAfter Bob performs the appropriate operation, his qubit B is now in the same state as Alice's original qubit A, effectively teleporting the qubit from Alice to Bob without physically moving the qubit itself."
