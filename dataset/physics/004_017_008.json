    "message_2": "To calculate the deflection angle of a star's light passing near the gravitational field of a massive galaxy, we can use the formula derived from general relativity:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = 4 * GM / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the massive galaxy\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance between the light path and the center of the massive galaxy\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to know the mass of the galaxy (M) and the impact parameter (b). Once we have these values, we can plug them into the formula and calculate the deflection angle (α)."
