    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the electron in a 3D spherical potential well, also known as a spherical quantum dot. The Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 3D spherical potential well with infinite potential barriers is given by:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (∇²ψ) = Eψ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the electron, ψ is the wave function, and E is the energy of the electron.\n\nThe wave function ψ can be separated into three parts, corresponding to the radial (R), polar (Θ), and azimuthal (Φ) components:\n\nψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r) * Θ(θ) * Φ(φ)\n\nThe radial part of the wave function, R(r), can be solved using the radial Schrödinger equation:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * dR/dr) + V(r) * R(r) = E * R(r)\n\nFor a spherical quantum dot with infinite potential barriers, the potential V(r) is zero inside the dot (r < R) and infinite outside the dot (r > R), where R is the radius of the quantum dot. In this case, R = 20 nm.\n\nThe solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation are given by the spherical Bessel functions:\n\nR(r) = A * j_l(kr)\n\nwhere A is a normalization constant, j_l is the l-th order spherical Bessel function, and k is the wave number related to the energy E by:\n\nE = ħ²k²/2m\n\nThe boundary condition at the edge of the quantum dot (r = R) requires that the wave function vanishes:\n\nR(R) = A * j_l(kR) = 0\n\nThis condition is satisfied when kR is equal to the l-th order zeros of the spherical Bessel function, denoted by x_l,n, where n is the index of the zero:\n\nkR = x_l,n\n\nThe energy spectrum is given by:\n\nE_n,l = ħ²(x_l,n)² / (2mR²)\n\nThe polar and azimuthal parts of the wave function are given by the spherical harmonics:\n\nΘ(θ) * Φ(φ) = Y_l^m(θ, φ)\n\nwhere Y_l^m are the spherical harmonics, l is the angular momentum quantum number, and m is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nFinally, the wave function of the electron confined in the spherical quantum dot is given by:\n\nψ_n,l,m(r, θ, φ) = R_n,l(r) * Y_l^m(θ, φ) = A * j_l(x_l,n * r/R) * Y_l^m(θ, φ)\n\nwhere n, l, and m are the quantum numbers that determine the energy levels and the shape of the wave function."
