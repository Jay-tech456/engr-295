    "message_2": "In order to analyze the interference pattern of two relativistic wave sources moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to consider the effects of special relativity. The interference pattern of two stationary wave sources can be described by the classical wave theory, where the superposition principle applies, and the resulting pattern depends on the phase difference between the two sources.\n\nWhen the wave sources are moving at relativistic speeds, the situation becomes more complex. The main effects that need to be considered are the Doppler shift and the relativistic time dilation.\n\n1. Doppler Shift: As the wave sources are moving, the frequency of the waves they emit will be different for an observer depending on their relative motion. If the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency will be higher (blue-shifted), and if the source is moving away, the frequency will be lower (red-shifted). This effect will cause the interference pattern to be different from the stationary case, as the phase difference between the two sources will be affected by their relative motion.\n\n2. Relativistic Time Dilation: Due to the high speeds of the sources, time dilation becomes significant. This means that the time intervals between wavefronts emitted by the sources will be different for an observer, depending on their relative motion. This effect will also influence the interference pattern, as the phase difference between the two sources will be affected by the time dilation.\n\nIn summary, the interference pattern of two relativistic wave sources moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light will be different from the pattern of two stationary wave sources. The main differences arise from the Doppler shift and relativistic time dilation, which affect the phase difference between the two sources and, consequently, the resulting interference pattern. The exact pattern will depend on the specific velocities of the sources and the observer's position relative to them."
