    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat required to convert 1 kg of ice at -10°C to water at 10°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 10°C\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of ice from kg to grams: 1 kg = 1000 g\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C:\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.1 J/g°C. \nQ1 = mass × specific heat capacity of ice × temperature change\nQ1 = 1000 g × 2.1 J/g°C × (0°C - (-10°C))\nQ1 = 1000 g × 2.1 J/g°C × 10°C\nQ1 = 21,000 J\n\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C:\nQ2 = mass × latent heat of fusion of ice\nQ2 = 1000 g × 334 J/g\nQ2 = 334,000 J\n\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 10°C:\nQ3 = mass × specific heat capacity of water × temperature change\nQ3 = 1000 g × 4.18 J/g°C × (10°C - 0°C)\nQ3 = 1000 g × 4.18 J/g°C × 10°C\nQ3 = 41,800 J\n\nNow, we add the heat required for all three steps:\nTotal heat required (Q) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3\nQ = 21,000 J + 334,000 J + 41,800 J\nQ = 396,800 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to convert 1 kg of ice at -10°C to water at 10°C is 396,800 J."
