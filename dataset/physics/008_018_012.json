    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong nuclear force. Its value depends on the energy scale at which it is measured. Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide one way to measure αs.\n\nThe value of the strong coupling constant measured using DIS at the LHC is typically given at a specific energy scale, such as the Z boson mass (mZ). The most recent world average value of αs(mZ) is approximately 0.1181, with an uncertainty of around ±0.0011.\n\nIt is important to note that the value of αs and its uncertainty can vary depending on the specific experimental data and analysis techniques used. As more data is collected and analysis methods improve, the uncertainty in the strong coupling constant may be further reduced."
