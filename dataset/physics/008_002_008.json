    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. However, there is a significant amount of experimental and observational evidence that suggests the existence of dark matter particles. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant object, such as a galaxy or quasar, passes through a massive object like a galaxy cluster, the gravitational force of the massive object bends the light, creating a lensing effect. The amount of lensing observed is often greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass of the massive object, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations have allowed scientists to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. These measurements are consistent with the existence of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the gravitational pull of dark matter. Computer simulations that include dark matter can reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the universe, while simulations without dark matter fail to do so.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. Observations of the cluster show that the visible matter (mainly gas) has been separated from the majority of the mass (as determined by gravitational lensing). This separation is consistent with the behavior of dark matter, which would not interact with the gas and would remain concentrated in the center of the cluster.\n\nWhile these observations provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, the exact nature and properties of dark matter particles remain unknown. Numerous experiments are currently underway to directly detect dark matter particles, such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), axions, or sterile neutrinos. So far, these experiments have not yet provided definitive evidence for the existence of dark matter particles, but they continue to refine our understanding of the possible properties of these elusive particles."
