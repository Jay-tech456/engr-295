    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, a beam of electrons is directed towards a barrier with two slits, and an interference pattern is observed on a screen placed behind the barrier. The interference pattern is a result of the wave-like behavior of electrons, which can be described by their wavefunction.\n\nThe relationship between the distance between the double-slit and the interference pattern can be derived from the principles of wave interference and the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons. The de Broglie wavelength (位) of an electron is given by:\n\n位 = h / p\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant, and p is the momentum of the electron.\n\nThe interference pattern produced on the screen consists of alternating bright and dark fringes. The distance between adjacent bright fringes (y) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ny = (L * 位) / d\n\nwhere L is the distance between the double-slit and the screen, 位 is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nSo, the relationship between the distance between the double-slit (d) and the interference pattern (y) is directly proportional to the distance between the double-slit and the screen (L) and inversely proportional to the distance between the two slits (d). This relationship shows that as the distance between the double-slit and the screen increases, the interference pattern becomes more spread out, and as the distance between the two slits increases, the interference pattern becomes more closely spaced."
