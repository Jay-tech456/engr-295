    "message_2": "The initial mass of a star that will ultimately evolve into a white dwarf after passing through the phases of a red giant, planetary nebula, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) is typically between 0.8 and 8 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). Stars with masses in this range do not have enough mass to undergo core-collapse supernovae and instead shed their outer layers, eventually leaving behind a white dwarf.\n\nThe mass of the star plays a crucial role in determining the elements that are synthesized during nucleosynthesis in its core. In general, more massive stars can reach higher core temperatures, which allows them to fuse heavier elements. Here's a brief overview of how the mass of a star affects nucleosynthesis:\n\n1. Low-mass stars (0.8 - 2 solar masses): These stars primarily fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores through the proton-proton chain. They do not reach high enough temperatures to fuse helium into heavier elements. When they exhaust their hydrogen fuel, they become red giants and eventually shed their outer layers, leaving behind a helium white dwarf.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass stars (2 - 8 solar masses): These stars can fuse hydrogen into helium through both the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. When they exhaust their hydrogen fuel, they become red giants and start fusing helium into carbon and oxygen in their cores through the triple-alpha process. After the helium is exhausted, they enter the AGB phase, where they experience thermal pulses and dredge-up events that can bring heavier elements to the surface. These stars eventually shed their outer layers, forming a planetary nebula and leaving behind a white dwarf composed mainly of carbon and oxygen.\n\n3. High-mass stars (> 8 solar masses): These stars can fuse hydrogen into helium through the CNO cycle and reach high enough core temperatures to fuse heavier elements such as carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon, ultimately producing iron in their cores. However, these stars do not evolve into white dwarfs. Instead, they undergo core-collapse supernovae, leaving behind either a neutron star or a black hole.\n\nIn summary, the initial mass of a star that will evolve into a white dwarf is typically between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. The mass of the star affects the elements synthesized during nucleosynthesis in its core, with more massive stars capable of fusing heavier elements due to their higher core temperatures."
