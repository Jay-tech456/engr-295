Given the enthalpy of formation for methane is -74.8 kJ/mol, and the enthalpies of formation for carbon dioxide and water are -393.5 kJ/mol and -285.8 kJ/mol respectively.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nNext, we'll use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the products minus the sum of the enthalpy changes for the reactants.\n\nΔH = Σ ΔH(products) - Σ ΔH(reactants)\n\nWe are given the enthalpies of formation for methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O):\n\nΔHf(CH4) = -74.8 kJ/mol\nΔHf(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Hess's Law equation:\n\nΔH = [1 × ΔHf(CO2) + 2 × ΔHf(H2O)] - [1 × ΔHf(CH4) + 2 × ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔHf(O2) = 0:\n\nΔH = [1 × (-393.5) + 2 × (-285.8)] - [1 × (-74.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.8\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane gas is -890.3 kJ/mol."
