    "message_2": "There are several promising direct detection techniques for finding dark matter particles. Some of the most notable methods include:\n\n1. Cryogenic detectors: These detectors use ultra-cold temperatures to search for dark matter particles. One example is the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, which uses germanium and silicon crystals cooled to extremely low temperatures. When a dark matter particle interacts with the crystal, it produces a small amount of heat and a charge signal, which can be detected.\n\n2. Liquid noble gas detectors: These detectors use noble gases like xenon or argon in a liquid state to search for dark"
