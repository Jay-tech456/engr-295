    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy of a particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v = 0.9c, so:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.9c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / √(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc²\nK.E. = (2.294 - 1)(5 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nK.E. ≈ 1.294 × 5 × (3 × 10^8)²\nK.E. ≈ 1.294 × 5 × 9 × 10^16\nK.E. ≈ 5.823 × 10^17 Joules\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 5.823 × 10^17 Joules."
