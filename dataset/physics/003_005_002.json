    "message_1": "A straight conductor carrying a current of 5 A produces a magnetic field of 0.02 T at a distance of 2 cm. What is the magnetic field produced by the same conductor at a distance of 5 cm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a straight conductor carrying a current:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the conductor.\n\nWe are given the magnetic field B₁ = 0.02 T at a distance r₁ = 2 cm = 0.02 m, and we want to find the magnetic field B₂ at a distance r₂ = 5 cm = 0.05 m.\n\nFirst, let's find the current I using the given values:\n\n0.02 T = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * I) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nSolving for I:\n\nI = (0.02 T * 2 * π * 0.02 m) / (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\nI = 5 A\n\nNow that we have the current, we can find the magnetic field B₂ at a distance of 0.05 m:\n\nB₂ = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r₂)\nB₂ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nB₂ = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T) / (0.1π)\nB₂ = 2 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo the magnetic field produced by the conductor at a distance of 5 cm is 2 × 10⁻⁶ T or 2 µT."
