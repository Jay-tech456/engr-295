    "message_2": "The Auger effect is a phenomenon in which an electron from an outer shell fills a vacancy in an inner shell, and the energy released in this process is transferred to another electron in an outer shell, causing it to be ejected from the atom. In this case, we have a carbon atom with a vacancy in the K-shell (1s orbital) and a single vacancy in one of its outer shells.\n\nTo calculate the probability of the Auger effect occurring, we need to consider the transition rates for the electrons involved. The probability of the Auger effect can be estimated using the ratio of the Auger transition rate (Wa) to the total transition rate (Wt), which includes both radiative (X-ray emission) and non-radiative (Auger) processes:\n\nP(Auger) = Wa / Wt\n\nThe Auger transition rate (Wa) depends on the initial and final states of the electrons involved in the process, as well as the atomic number (Z) of the element. For carbon (Z = 6), the Auger transition rates for different outer shells can be found in the literature or calculated using theoretical models.\n\nLet's consider several different outer shells for the carbon atom:\n\n1. L-shell (2s and 2p orbitals):\nFor a vacancy in the L-shell, the Auger transition rate is relatively high, as the electrons in the L-shell are closer to the nucleus and have a higher probability of interacting with the K-shell vacancy. The probability of the Auger effect occurring in this case can be estimated to be around 90-95%.\n\n2. M-shell (3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals):\nFor a vacancy in the M-shell, the Auger transition rate is lower than for the L-shell, as the electrons in the M-shell are farther from the nucleus and have a lower probability of interacting with the K-shell vacancy. The probability of the Auger effect occurring in this case can be estimated to be around 60-70%.\n\n3. N-shell (4s, 4p, 4d, and 4f orbitals):\nFor a vacancy in the N-shell, the Auger transition rate is even lower than for the M-shell, as the electrons in the N-shell are even farther from the nucleus and have a lower probability of interacting with the K-shell vacancy. The probability of the Auger effect occurring in this case can be estimated to be around 30-40%.\n\nAs we can see, the probability of the Auger effect occurring decreases as the outer shell vacancy moves farther from the nucleus. This is because the interaction between the electrons and the nucleus becomes weaker as the distance increases, leading to a lower transition rate for the Auger process."
