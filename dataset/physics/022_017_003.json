    "message_2": "Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are hypothetical particles that are considered as one of the leading candidates for dark matter. The mass range of WIMPs that could potentially explain the observed abundance of dark matter in the universe is not precisely known, but current theoretical models and experimental data suggest a range of approximately 1 GeV to a few TeV (gigaelectronvolts to teraelectronvolts).\n\nThis mass range is derived from the WIMP miracle, which is the observation that WIMPs with weak-scale masses and interactions naturally produce the correct relic abundance of dark matter. The WIMP miracle is based on the assumption that dark matter particles were in thermal equilibrium with other particles in the early universe and then \"froze out\" as the universe expanded and cooled.\n\nIt is important to note that this mass range is not definitive, and the true mass of WIMPs, if they exist, could lie outside this range. Moreover, there are ongoing experimental searches for WIMPs, such as direct detection experiments (e.g., XENON1T, LUX, and DarkSide) and indirect detection experiments (e.g., Fermi-LAT and IceCube), which aim to narrow down the possible mass range and properties of WIMPs."
