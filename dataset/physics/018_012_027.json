    "message_2": "The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, is designed to detect high-energy gamma rays in the energy range of about 20 MeV (Mega-electron volts) to over 300 GeV (Giga-electron volts). This wide energy range allows the telescope to observe various astrophysical phenomena and sources that emit high-energy gamma rays. \n\nSome of the primary sources of high-energy gamma rays detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope include:\n\n1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): These are the extremely bright and energetic cores of distant galaxies, powered by supermassive black holes. AGNs emit gamma rays as a result of the acceleration of particles in the vicinity of the black hole.\n\n2. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): These are the most energetic and luminous explosions in the universe, usually associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. GRBs emit intense gamma rays during the initial phase of the explosion.\n\n3. Supernova Remnants (SNRs): The remnants of exploded stars can accelerate particles to extremely high energies, producing gamma rays in the process. SNRs are important sources of cosmic rays and contribute to our understanding of the origin of these high-energy particles.\n\n4. Pulsars: These are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, including gamma rays. The Fermi Telescope has detected gamma rays from numerous pulsars, providing insights into the processes occurring in these extreme environments.\n\n5. Star-forming regions: Regions with intense star formation can also produce gamma rays due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, resulting in the production of high-energy particles and gamma rays.\n\n6. Dark matter: Although not yet directly observed, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is also searching for signals of dark matter annihilation or decay, which could produce gamma rays in specific energy ranges.\n\nThese sources, among others, contribute to our understanding of the high-energy processes occurring in the universe and help us unravel the mysteries of cosmic phenomena."
