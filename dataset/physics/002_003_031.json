    "message_2": "To determine the internal energy of the system, we first need to identify the type of gas. Since no specific gas is mentioned, we will assume it is an ideal diatomic gas, such as nitrogen or oxygen. For diatomic gases, the degrees of freedom (f) are 5 (3 translational and 2 rotational).\n\nNext, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can use the equipartition theorem to calculate the internal energy (U) of the system:\n\nU = (f/2) * n * R * T\n\nwhere f is the degrees of freedom, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nU = (5/2) * 1 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * 298.15 K\n\nU = 6185.1 J\n\nThe internal energy of the system is approximately 6185.1 Joules."
