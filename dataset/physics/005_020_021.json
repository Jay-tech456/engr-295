    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for frequency:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency measured by the observer on Earth, f_source is the frequency emitted by the spaceship, v is the speed of the spaceship relative to the speed of light (c), and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn this case, f_source = 10 MHz = 10 x 10^6 Hz, and v = 0.8c.\n\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * sqrt(1 / 9)\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * (1 / 3)\n\nf_observed â‰ˆ 3.33 x 10^6 Hz\n\nSo, the observer on Earth will measure the radio signal at a frequency of approximately 3.33 MHz."
