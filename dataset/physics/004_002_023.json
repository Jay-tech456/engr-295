    "message_2": "The temperature near a black hole's event horizon is related to the concept of Hawking radiation, which is a theoretical prediction made by physicist Stephen Hawking. According to this theory, black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation is also known as black hole evaporation, as it causes the black hole to lose mass over time.\n\nThe temperature of the Hawking radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. Specifically, the temperature (T) is given by the formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that as the mass of the black hole decreases, the temperature of the Hawking radiation increases. Therefore, the maximum possible temperature near a black hole's event horizon would occur when the black hole has the smallest possible mass. This would happen just before the black hole evaporates completely.\n\nThe connection between the temperature of a black hole and the laws of thermodynamics is established through the concept of black hole entropy. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon's surface area, and it is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\n\nS = (kc³A) / (4ħG)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and the other constants are the same as before.\n\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. When a black hole forms, the entropy of the matter that collapses into it is converted into the entropy of the black hole. As the black hole evaporates, its entropy decreases, but the entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation increases. The total entropy of the system (black hole + radiation) always increases, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn summary, the maximum possible temperature near a black hole's event horizon occurs when the black hole has the smallest possible mass, just before it evaporates completely. This temperature is related to the black hole's properties through the Hawking radiation formula and is connected to the laws of thermodynamics through the concept of black hole entropy."
