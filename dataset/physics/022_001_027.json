    "message_2": "The most promising theory for the nature of dark matter particles is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) hypothesis. WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are thought to be heavy (with masses between 10 and 1000 times the mass of a proton) and interact only through the weak nuclear force and gravity. This makes them difficult to detect directly, as they would not emit or absorb light and would rarely interact with ordinary matter.\n\nThe WIMP hypothesis is supported by several lines of observational evidence:\n\n1. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational glue holding these structures together. WIMPs provide a suitable candidate for this dark matter, as their weak interactions would allow them to clump together and form the necessary gravitational scaffolding.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Observations of the CMB show that the universe is composed of about 26% dark matter, which is consistent with the WIMP hypothesis.\n\n3. Galactic rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of galaxies show that they are rotating faster than can be accounted for by the visible matter alone. This suggests the presence of an unseen mass, such as WIMPs, providing the additional gravitational pull.\n\n4. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. Observations show that the majority of the mass in the clusters is not associated with the visible matter (stars and gas), but rather with a separate, unseen component, which is consistent with the presence of WIMPs.\n\nCompared to other theories, the WIMP hypothesis has the most observational support. Alternative theories, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or self-interacting dark matter, have been proposed to explain some of the same phenomena, but they often struggle to account for all the evidence or require additional assumptions.\n\nHowever, despite the strong indirect evidence for WIMPs, direct detection experiments have not yet found conclusive evidence of their existence. This has led some researchers to consider other dark matter candidates, such as axions or sterile neutrinos. While the WIMP hypothesis remains the most promising, the search for the true nature of dark matter continues."
