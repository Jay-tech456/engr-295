    "message_2": "The angle of incidence is not directly related to the intensity of the light or the reflection coefficient. However, we can find the angle between the plane of polarization of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer, which is given as 30 degrees.\n\nThe intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) through the polarizer can be found using Malus's Law:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_i is the intensity of the incident light (30 W/m²), θ is the angle between the plane of polarization of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer (30 degrees), and cos^2(θ) is the square of the cosine of the angle.\n\nFirst, let's find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(30) = 0.866\n\nNow, let's square the cosine:\n\ncos^2(30) = (0.866)^2 = 0.75\n\nNow, we can find the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_t = 30 W/m² * 0.75 = 22.5 W/m²\n\nThe angle of incidence is not directly related to the given information, but we have found the intensity of the transmitted light through the polarizer."
