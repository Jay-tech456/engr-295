    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between two consecutive bright fringes, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between consecutive bright fringes (m)\nm = order of the bright fringe (integer)\nλ = wavelength of the monochromatic light (m)\nL = distance between the double-slit apparatus and the screen (m)\nd = distance between the two slits (m)\n\nWe are given the following values:\nL = 1 m\nd = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\n\nWe want to find the distance between two consecutive bright fringes (y), so we will calculate the distance for m = 1 and m = 2, and then find the difference between them.\n\nFor m = 1:\ny1 = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\ny1 = 6 * 10^(-6) / 10^(-4)\ny1 = 6 * 10^(-2) m\ny1 = 0.06 m\n\nFor m = 2:\ny2 = (2 * 600 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\ny2 = 12 * 10^(-6) / 10^(-4)\ny2 = 12 * 10^(-2) m\ny2 = 0.12 m\n\nNow, we find the difference between y1 and y2:\nΔy = y2 - y1\nΔy = 0.12 m - 0.06 m\nΔy = 0.06 m\n\nSo, the distance between two consecutive bright fringes is 0.06 m or 6 cm."
