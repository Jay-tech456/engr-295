    "message_2": "To calculate the free energy change (∆G) of protein-ligand binding, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = -RT ln(Ka)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), and Ka is the association constant, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant (Kd).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Kd value from nM to M:\n\nKd = 10 nM = 10 × 10^(-9) M\n\nNow, we can calculate the association constant (Ka):\n\nKa = 1 / Kd = 1 / (10 × 10^(-9) M) = 10^8 M^(-1)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the free energy change (∆G):\n\n∆G = - (8.314 J/mol·K) × (298 K) × ln(10^8 M^(-1))\n\n∆G ≈ - (8.314 J/mol·K) × (298 K) × (18.42)\n\n∆G ≈ -45,700 J/mol\n\nSo, the free energy change (∆G) of protein-ligand binding at 298 K and pH 7.4, given the binding constant (Kd) of the interaction is 10 nM, is approximately -45.7 kJ/mol."
