    "message_1": "A student observes double-slit interference using monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm. The distance between the slits is 0.4 mm, and the screen is located 1.5 meters away from the slits. If the interference pattern on the screen shows a bright fringe at an angle of 30 degrees from the central maximum, what is the distance between adjacent bright fringes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the angular position of bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (an integer), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the order of the fringe at 30 degrees. We can rearrange the formula to solve for m:\n\nm = (d * sin(θ)) / λ\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nm = (0.4 * 10^(-3) m * sin(30°)) / (600 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nm ≈ 1.15\n\nSince m must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is 1. So, the bright fringe at 30 degrees is the first-order fringe.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance between adjacent bright fringes. To do this, we can use the small angle approximation for the angular separation between adjacent fringes:\n\nΔθ ≈ λ / d\n\nNow, we can find the linear distance between adjacent fringes on the screen using the formula:\n\nΔy = L * Δθ\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between adjacent bright fringes, and L is the distance between the slits and the screen.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔy = 1.5 m * (600 * 10^(-9) m / (0.4 * 10^(-3) m))\n\nΔy ≈ 2.25 * 10^(-3) m\n\nSo, the distance between adjacent bright fringes is approximately 2.25 mm."
