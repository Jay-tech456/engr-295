    "message_2": "The dependence of the spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric crystal on the applied electric field can be described using the hysteresis loop. In a ferroelectric crystal, the spontaneous polarization is the result of the alignment of electric dipoles within the crystal lattice. When an external electric field is applied, it causes the dipoles to align further in the direction of the field, increasing the polarization.\n\nInitially, as the electric field is increased, the spontaneous polarization increases linearly with the field. However, as the field strength continues to increase, the polarization reaches a saturation point, where all the dipoles are aligned in the direction of the field, and the polarization does not increase further.\n\nWhen the electric field is reduced, the polarization does not return to zero immediately. Instead, it follows a hysteresis loop, where the polarization decreases but remains non-zero even when the field is removed. This is known as the remanent polarization. To completely remove the polarization, a reverse electric field must be applied.\n\nThe hysteresis loop is a characteristic feature of ferroelectric materials and is used to describe the dependence of the spontaneous polarization on the applied electric field. The shape and size of the hysteresis loop can vary depending on the specific ferroelectric material and its properties, such as the coercive field (the field required to reduce the polarization to zero) and the saturation polarization (the maximum polarization that can be achieved)."
