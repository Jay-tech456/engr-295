    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted from the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formula for the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the merger.\n\nHowever, we need to find the time until the merger (t) first. We can use the following formula for the chirp mass (M_c) of the binary system:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes. In this case, m1 = 20 solar masses and m2 = 30 solar masses.\n\nM_c = (20 * 30)^(3/5) / (20 + 30)^(1/5)\nM_c ≈ 23.9 solar masses\n\nNow, we can use the chirp mass to find the time until the merger (t) using the following formula:\n\nt = (5/256) * (G * M_c / c^3)^(-5/3) * f^(-8/3)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the frequency (f) as a function of time (t):\n\nf(t) = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves increases as the black holes get closer to each other and merge. The merger itself happens when the black holes are at their innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The frequency at ISCO (f_ISCO) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf_ISCO = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * M)\n\nwhere M is the total mass of the binary system (M = m1 + m2).\n\nf_ISCO = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * (20 + 30))\nf_ISCO ≈ 157 Hz\n\nThe frequency range of gravitational waves emitted from the merger of two black holes with masses of 20 and 30 solar masses is expected to start from a lower frequency and increase up to around 157 Hz during the inspiral phase. The actual frequency range may vary depending on the specific details of the merger, such as the black holes' spins and orbital eccentricity."
