    "message_1": "A Carnot engine operates between a hot reservoir at 400 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K. If the engine produces 1.5 kW of power, what is the efficiency of the engine?",
    "message_2": "The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (Tc/Th)\n\nwhere Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir. Both temperatures should be in Kelvin.\n\nIn this case, Tc = 300 K and Th = 400 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300/400)\nEfficiency = 1 - 0.75\nEfficiency = 0.25\n\nSo, the efficiency of the Carnot engine is 25%."
