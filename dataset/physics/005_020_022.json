What is the speed of the radio wave relative to the spaceship? Use the relativistic wave Doppler effect equation to find the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect equation for frequency:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed on Earth, f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship, v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to the speed of light (c), and c is the speed of light. In this case, f_observed = 3 GHz, f_emitted = 6 GHz, and v = 0.8c.\n\nFirst, we will solve for the ratio of the observed frequency to the emitted frequency:\n\nf_observed / f_emitted = sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\n3 GHz / 6 GHz = sqrt((1 - 0.8c) / (1 + 0.8c))\n\n0.5 = sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\n\n0.5 = sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\n\nNow, we will square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n0.25 = 0.2 / 1.8\n\nNext, we will solve for the speed of the radio wave relative to the spaceship:\n\nv_relative = c * (1 - (f_observed / f_emitted)^2)\n\nv_relative = c * (1 - 0.25)\n\nv_relative = 0.75c\n\nSo, the speed of the radio wave relative to the spaceship is 0.75 times the speed of light, or 0.75c."
