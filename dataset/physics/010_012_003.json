    "message_2": "We are given the velocity profile of the fluid flow over the flat plate as: $u(y) = U_\\infty \\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)^2$, where $U_\\infty$ = 10 m/s and $\\delta$ = 1.5 cm.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ to meters: $\\delta$ = 1.5 cm = 0.015 m.\n\nNow, we need to find the shear stress at the surface of the plate. The shear stress $\\tau$ is given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and $\\frac{du}{dy}$ is the velocity gradient at the surface of the plate (y = 0).\n\nTo find the velocity gradient, we need to differentiate the velocity profile with respect to y:\n\n$$\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left(U_\\infty \\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)^2\\right) = 2U_\\infty \\frac{y}{\\delta^2}$$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the velocity gradient at the surface of the plate (y = 0):\n\n$$\\left.\\frac{du}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = 2U_\\infty \\frac{0}{\\delta^2} = 0$$\n\nSince the velocity gradient at the surface of the plate is 0, the shear stress at the surface of the plate is also 0:\n\n$$\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} = 0.001 \\times 0 = 0$$\n\nSo, the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ is 0.015 m, and the shear stress at the surface of the plate is 0 N/mÂ²."
