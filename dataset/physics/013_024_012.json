    "message_2": "The maximum safe dose of cosmic radiation exposure for astronauts on a round-trip mission to Mars depends on several factors, including the duration of the mission, solar activity, and shielding provided by the spacecraft and habitats. \n\nNASA has established a career limit for astronauts' radiation exposure, which is based on age and gender. This limit is set to not exceed a 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) from cancer. For a round-trip mission to Mars, the estimated radiation exposure ranges from 500 to 1200 millisieverts (mSv), depending on the mission's duration and solar activity.\n\nA typical round-trip mission to Mars, including time spent on the planet, is estimated to last around 2-3 years. During this time, astronauts would be exposed to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle events (SPEs). GCRs are a continuous source of radiation, while SPEs are sporadic but can produce intense bursts of radiation.\n\nOn Earth, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers is set at 50 mSv, and the general public's limit is 1 mSv per year, excluding natural background and medical radiation. Comparatively, the radiation exposure for astronauts on a Mars mission would be significantly higher than the limits set for humans on Earth.\n\nTo minimize the risk of radiation exposure, mission planners and engineers are working on developing advanced shielding materials and technologies, as well as considering the timing of the mission to coincide with periods of lower solar activity. Additionally, early warning systems for solar particle events and the use of radiation-safe havens within the spacecraft can help reduce the overall radiation dose received by astronauts during the mission."
