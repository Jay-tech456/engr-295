    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.5c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ ≈ 1.155\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.155 - 1) * 1000 kg * c^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.155 * 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.155 * 1000 kg * 9 * 10^16 J/kg\nK.E. ≈ 1.395 * 10^19 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.395 * 10^19 Joules."
