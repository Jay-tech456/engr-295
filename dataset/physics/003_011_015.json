    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed across the disc, we can consider a small current element on a concentric ring of radius r' and thickness dr'. The area of this ring is dA = 2πr'dr', and the total area of the disc is A = πR², where R is the radius of the disc (0.2 m). The current density J (A/m²) is given by:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nThe current dI flowing through the small ring is:\n\ndI = J * dA = (I / A) * 2πr'dr'\n\nNow, let's consider a small length dl' on the ring. The magnetic field dB due to this length at the point P (0.1 m above the center) can be calculated using the Biot-Savart Law. The position vector r is given by:\n\nr = sqrt((0.1)² + r'²)\n\nThe angle θ between dl' and r can be found using geometry:\n\nsinθ = r' / r\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl' * sinθ) / r³\n\nIntegrating over the entire ring, we get the magnetic field dB_total due to the ring:\n\ndB_total = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πr' * sinθ) / r³\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB_total over the entire disc (from r' = 0 to r' = R) to find the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = ∫(dB_total) from 0 to R\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = ∫[(μ₀ * I * 2πr'^2 * dr') / (4π * A * r³)] from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * A) * ∫[(r'^2 * dr') / (r'^2 + 0.1²)^(3/2)] from 0 to R\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet x = r'^2 / (r'^2 + 0.1²)\n\nThen, dx = (2 * r' * dr') / (r'^2 + 0.1²)\n\nSo, dr' = (r'^2 + 0.1²) * dx / (2 * r')\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * A) * ∫[(r'^2 * (r'^2 + 0.1²) * dx) / (2 * r' * (r'^2 + 0.1²)^(3/2))] from x(0) to x(R)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * A) * ∫[dx / sqrt(r'^2 + 0.1²)] from x(0) to x(R)\n\nNow, we need to find the limits of integration for x:\n\nWhen r' = 0, x = 0\n\nWhen r' = R, x = R² / (R² + 0.1²) = 0.2² / (0.2² + 0.1²) = 0.04 / 0.05 = 4/5\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * A) * ∫[dx / sqrt(r'^2 + 0.1²)] from 0 to 4/5\n\nThis integral can be solved using a standard integral table or a computer algebra system. The result is approximately:\n\nB ≈ (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.2² m²) * 0.1 m ≈ 2 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.1 m above the center of the disc is approximately 2 × 10^(-7) T."
