    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram and find the magnification of the image, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the concave mirror with its principal axis, focus (F), and center of curvature (C).\n2. Place the object (O) 30 cm away from the mirror along the principal axis.\n3. Draw three rays from the top of the object:\n   a. A parallel ray to the principal axis, which will reflect through the focus (F).\n   b. A ray passing through the focus (F), which will reflect parallel to the principal axis.\n   c. A ray passing through the center of curvature (C), which will reflect back along the same path.\n4. The point where all three reflected rays intersect is the location of the image (I).\n\nNow, let's find the magnification of the image using the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 15 cm, u = -30 cm (object distance is negative for a real object)\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/15 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/15 + 1/30\n1/v = (2 + 1) / 30\n1/v = 3/30\nv = 30/3\nv = 10 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 10 cm, and it is positive, which means the image is real and inverted.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -10 / (-30)\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object and inverted."
