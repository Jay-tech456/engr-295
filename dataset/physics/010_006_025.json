    "message_1": "A rectangular container has a length of 2 meters, a width of 1 meter, and a height of 3 meters. The container is filled with water up to a depth of 2 meters. Find the pressure at the bottom of the container. (Assume the density of water to be 1000 kg/m³ and acceleration due to gravity to be 9.81 m/s²)",
    "message_2": "To find the pressure at the bottom of the container, we can use the formula for hydrostatic pressure:\n\nP = ρgh\n\nwhere P is the pressure, ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid (water in this case), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height (depth) of the fluid.\n\nGiven:\nρ = 1000 kg/m³ (density of water)\ng = 9.81 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity)\nh = 2 m (depth of water in the container)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = (1000 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)(2 m)\n\nP = 19620 kg m/s² m²\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m/s² m², the pressure at the bottom of the container is:\n\nP = 19620 Pa"
