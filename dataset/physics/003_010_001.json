    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the cylindrical wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius 5 cm (0.05 m) centered at the wire as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, so the dot product B⋅dl reduces to B*dl.\n\nNow, we need to find the enclosed current within the loop. Since the wire has a radius of 3 cm (0.03 m), the entire current of 6 A is enclosed within the loop.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we can write:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWhere r is the radius of the Amperian loop (0.05 m), and μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nB * 2π(0.05) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 6\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 6) / (2π * 0.05)\n\nB ≈ 2.4 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the cylindrical wire is approximately 2.4 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the direction of the current in the wire."
