    "message_2": "The likelihood that black holes could account for all the observed dark matter in the Universe is considered to be low. While black holes are massive and do contribute to the overall mass of the Universe, they are not believed to be numerous enough or have the right distribution to account for all the dark matter.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up about 27% of the Universe's mass-energy content. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the bending of light from distant objects.\n\nSeveral observational evidence points against black holes being the sole constituents of dark matter:\n\n1. Gravitational microlensing: If black holes made up a significant portion of dark matter, they would cause observable gravitational microlensing events as they pass in front of background stars. However, the observed rate of microlensing events is lower than what would be expected if black holes were the primary component of dark matter.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides crucial information about the early Universe. The observed pattern of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with the presence of non-baryonic dark matter, which would not include black holes.\n\n3. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of dark matter in the Universe plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Simulations of structure formation that include non-baryonic dark matter, such as cold dark matter particles, match the observed large-scale structure much better than those that include only black holes.\n\n4. Primordial black holes: Some have suggested that primordial black holes, formed in the early Universe, could account for dark matter. However, various observational constraints, such as the lack of observed gamma-ray background radiation from black hole evaporation, make this scenario unlikely.\n\nIn conclusion, while black holes do contribute to the mass of the Universe, they are not considered a viable candidate for explaining all the observed dark matter. Instead, most physicists believe that dark matter is likely composed of yet-to-be-discovered subatomic particles that do not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation."
