    "message_2": "The likelihood of black holes being the source of primordial black holes (PBHs) is still a topic of debate and research among physicists. Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. There are several proposed mechanisms for the formation of PBHs, and the idea that they originate from black holes is just one of them.\n\nOne theory suggests that PBHs could have formed from the direct collapse of large density fluctuations in the early universe. In this scenario, regions with higher density than the surrounding areas would have collapsed under their own gravity, leading to the formation of PBHs. This process would have occurred during the radiation-dominated era of the universe, before the formation of stars and galaxies.\n\nAnother proposed mechanism for the formation of PBHs is through the collapse of cosmic strings or domain walls. Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that could have formed during phase transitions in the early universe. Domain walls are two-dimensional topological defects that could also have formed during phase transitions. The collapse of these structures could lead to the formation of PBHs.\n\nThe idea that black holes could be the source of PBHs is based on the assumption that black holes can form from the collapse of massive stars or other astrophysical processes. However, this theory is less likely than the other proposed mechanisms because it requires the existence of massive stars or other structures in the very early universe, which is not supported by current cosmological models.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is not impossible for black holes to be the source of primordial black holes, it is considered less likely than other proposed explanations. Further research and observational data are needed to determine the true origin of these elusive objects."
