    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of length 20 cm and width 10 cm carries a current of 2 A. Find the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 15 cm away from the center of the loop along its axis.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop is rectangular, we can simplify the calculation by finding the magnetic field due to each side of the rectangle and then summing them up.\n\nLet's consider the four sides of the rectangle:\n\n1. Side A: Length 20 cm, parallel to the axis, and at a distance of 5 cm from point P.\n2. Side B: Length 10 cm, perpendicular to the axis, and at a distance of 15 cm from point P.\n3. Side C: Length 20 cm, parallel to the axis, and at a distance of 25 cm from point P.\n4. Side D: Length 10 cm, perpendicular to the axis, and at a distance of 15 cm from point P.\n\nThe magnetic field due to sides A and C will cancel each other out since they are parallel to the axis and equidistant from point P. Therefore, we only need to calculate the magnetic field due to sides B and D.\n\nFor a straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance R from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the distance from the wire.\n\nFor side B, the magnetic field at point P is:\n\nB_B = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m) = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.3π m) = 2.67 × 10^(-6) T\n\nFor side D, the magnetic field at point P is the same as for side B, since the distance and current are the same:\n\nB_D = B_B = 2.67 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince sides B and D are perpendicular to the axis, their magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, we can find the total magnetic field at point P by adding the magnetic fields due to sides B and D using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nB_total = √(B_B^2 + B_D^2) = √((2.67 × 10^(-6) T)^2 + (2.67 × 10^(-6) T)^2) = 3.77 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 3.77 × 10^(-6) T."
