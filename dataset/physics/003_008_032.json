    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of dimensions 5m x 10m carries a current of 2A uniformly distributed throughout the sheet. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 3m from the center of the sheet and 2m above it?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the sheet, we can define the current density J (current per unit area) as:\n\nJ = I / (width × length) = 2 A / (5 m × 10 m) = 0.04 A/m²\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element dI at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the width and y from the center along the length. The area of this small element is dA = dx * dy. The current in this small element is:\n\ndI = J * dA = 0.04 A/m² * dx * dy\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to point P is:\n\nr = <x, y, 2> m\n\nThe distance from the current element to point P is:\n\n|r| = √(x² + y² + 2²) m\n\nThe direction of the current element is along the width of the sheet (along the x-axis). Therefore, the small current element dl is:\n\ndl = <dx, 0, 0> m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB at point P due to this small current element:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / |r|³\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (0.04 * dx * dy * <dx, 0, 0> x <x, y, 2>) / (x² + y² + 2²)^(3/2)\n\nThe cross product of dl and r is:\n\n<dx, 0, 0> x <x, y, 2> = <-2dx, 0, ydx>\n\nSo, the magnetic field dB is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (0.04 * <-2dx, 0, ydx>) / (x² + y² + 2²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire sheet to find the total magnetic field at point P. The limits of integration for x are from -2.5 m to 2.5 m (half of the width) and for y are from -5 m to 5 m (half of the length):\n\nB = ∬ dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.04 * ∬ <-2dx, 0, ydx> / (x² + y² + 2²)^(3/2) dA\n\nSince the magnetic field has a symmetry along the x and y axes, the x and y components of the magnetic field will cancel out, leaving only the z-component:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.04 * ∬ (ydx) / (x² + y² + 2²)^(3/2) dA\n\nNow, we can perform the double integral:\n\nBz = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 0.04 * ∫[∫ (ydx) / (x² + y² + 2²)^(3/2) dy] dx\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a simple analytical solution. However, we can use numerical methods (such as a computer software like Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha) to evaluate the integral:\n\nBz ≈ 1.15 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.15 µT, and the direction is along the positive z-axis (upward)."
