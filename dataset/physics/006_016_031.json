    "message_2": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency (ν) of a nucleus can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nν = γ * B\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (in MHz/T) and B is the magnetic field strength (in Tesla).\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of oxygen-17 nucleus as 5.77 MHz/T and the magnetic field strength (B) as 9.4 Tesla, we can calculate the NMR frequency (ν) as follows:\n\nν = (5.77 MHz/T) * (9.4 T)\n\nν = 54.238 MHz\n\nTherefore, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency of an oxygen-17 nucleus in a magnetic field of 9.4 Tesla is approximately 54.238 MHz."
