    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, for a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses:\n\nM = 3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 8.861 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,861 meters or 8.861 kilometers."
