    "message_1": "What is the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) when a specific protein denatures at a temperature of 50°C? The protein in question has a melting temperature (Tm) of 60°C, and the enthalpy of denaturation (∆H) is 200 kJ/mol. Assume that the entropy (∆S) of denaturation is -500 J/K.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) during the denaturation of a protein, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆H is the enthalpy of denaturation, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the entropy of denaturation.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G = 200 kJ/mol - (323.15 K * -500 J/K)\n\nSince the units for ∆H are in kJ/mol and the units for T∆S are in J/mol, we need to convert the entropy term to kJ/mol:\n\nT∆S = 323.15 K * -500 J/K * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -161.575 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate ∆G:\n\n∆G = 200 kJ/mol - (-161.575 kJ/mol) = 361.575 kJ/mol\n\nSo the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) when the protein denatures at a temperature of 50°C is 361.575 kJ/mol."
