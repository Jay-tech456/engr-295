    "message_2": "Renormalization is a powerful technique in quantum field theories (QFT) that helps to resolve the issue of infinite self-energy and other divergences that arise in perturbative calculations. The basic idea behind renormalization is to absorb the infinities into the redefinition of physical parameters, such as mass and charge, and to express the results in terms of measurable quantities.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how renormalization can be applied to resolve the issue of infinite self-energy in quantum field theories:\n\n1. Identify the divergences: In QFT, when we calculate the self-energy of particles or other quantities using perturbation theory, we often encounter divergent integrals. These divergences are typically ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which arise due to the integration over high-energy (short-distance) modes in the loop integrals.\n\n2. Regularize the divergences: To deal with these divergences, we first need to regularize them. Regularization is a process of introducing a regulator (such as a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) to make the integrals finite. This allows us to perform calculations without encountering infinities.\n\n3. Renormalize the parameters: After regularizing the divergences, we can rewrite the perturbative expansion in terms of \"bare\" parameters (mass, charge, etc.) and their counterterms. The counterterms are introduced to absorb the divergences and make the physical parameters finite. This process is called renormalization.\n\n4. Renormalization conditions: To determine the counterterms, we impose renormalization conditions. These conditions relate the bare parameters to the physical (renormalized) parameters, which are measurable quantities. The renormalization conditions are usually imposed at a specific energy scale called the renormalization scale.\n\n5. Calculate physical quantities: With the renormalized parameters and the counterterms determined, we can now calculate physical quantities, such as scattering amplitudes and decay rates, in terms of the renormalized parameters. These results will be finite and well-defined.\n\n6. Remove the regulator: Finally, we can remove the regulator and take the limit as the regulator goes to infinity (or the regularization parameter goes to zero). The physical quantities calculated in the previous step should remain finite and well-defined in this limit.\n\nIn summary, the technique of renormalization allows us to systematically deal with the infinities that arise in quantum field theories by absorbing them into the redefinition of physical parameters. This makes it possible to express the results in terms of measurable quantities and obtain finite, well-defined predictions for physical processes."
