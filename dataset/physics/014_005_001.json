    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe. It is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other observational tools that rely on detecting light. Despite this invisibility, dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (the stuff we can see) makes up only about 5%.\n\nThe influence of dark matter on the large-scale structure of the universe can be understood through its gravitational effects. Dark matter acts as a cosmic scaffolding, providing the necessary gravitational force to hold galaxies and galaxy clusters together, as well as influencing the overall distribution of matter in the universe.\n\nThere are several lines of observational evidence that support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of stars in spiral galaxies show that stars further from the galactic center are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a large amount of unseen mass, i.e., dark matter, that provides the additional gravitational force needed to keep the stars in their observed orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant galaxy passes through a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the gravitational field of the massive object bends the light, causing the distant galaxy to appear distorted. The degree of distortion can be used to estimate the mass of the intervening object. In many cases, the observed mass based on gravitational lensing is much greater than the mass of visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to infer the distribution of matter at that time. Observations of the CMB are consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Computer simulations of the evolution of the universe show that the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters can only be reproduced if a significant amount of dark matter is included in the simulations. The presence of dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to enable the formation of these large-scale structures.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter plays a vital role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, and its existence is supported by multiple lines of observational evidence, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure formation simulations."
