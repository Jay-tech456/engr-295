    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nIn this case, the reactants are 2 moles of hydrogen gas (H2) and 1 mole of oxygen gas (O2), and the product is 2 moles of water (H2O).\n\nΔH_f(H2) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(O2) = 0 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -286 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_reaction = [(2 moles × -286 kJ/mol) - (2 moles × 0 kJ/mol + 1 mole × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = [-572 kJ - (0 kJ + 0 kJ)]\n\nΔH_reaction = -572 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change at constant pressure for the reaction of 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water is -572 kJ."
