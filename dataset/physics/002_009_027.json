    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to melt the ice and convert it into water at the same temperature, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × latent heat of fusion (Lf)\n\nwhere\nmass (m) = 250 grams\nlatent heat of fusion (Lf) = 334 J/g\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nQ = 250 g × 334 J/g\n\nQ = 83,500 J\n\nSo, the amount of energy required to completely melt 250 grams of ice at 0°C and convert it into water at the same temperature is 83,500 Joules."
