    "message_2": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect can be described by the Larmor precession frequency, which is the frequency at which the nuclear magnetic moment precesses around the external magnetic field. The Larmor frequency (ν) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nν = (γ / 2π) * B\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which relates the magnetic moment (μ) to the nuclear spin (I) through the equation:\n\nμ = γ * ħ * I\n\nHere, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js). To find the gyromagnetic ratio, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nγ = μ / (ħ * I)\n\nGiven the values for the magnetic moment (μ = 3.2 μN) and the nuclear spin (I = 3/2), we can calculate the gyromagnetic ratio:\n\nγ = (3.2 * 10^(-8) Nm) / (1.054 * 10^(-34) Js * 3/2)\nγ ≈ 6.08 * 10^7 T^(-1) s^(-1)\n\nNow, we can use the gyromagnetic ratio and the external magnetic field strength (B = 2.5 T) to calculate the Larmor frequency:\n\nν = (6.08 * 10^7 T^(-1) s^(-1) / 2π) * 2.5 T\nν ≈ 24.3 MHz\n\nSo, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect for this atom with a nucleus of spin I=3/2 and a magnetic moment of μ=3.2μN when placed in an external magnetic field of strength B=2.5 T is a Larmor precession frequency of approximately 24.3 MHz."
