    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy (E) and momentum (p) of a high-energy nuclear particle can be described by the relativistic energy-momentum equation. This equation takes into account the effects of special relativity, which become significant at high energies. The equation is:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere:\n- E is the total energy of the particle,\n- p is the momentum of the particle,\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second), and\n- m is the mass of the particle.\n\nIn this equation, the first term (pc)² represents the kinetic energy of the particle, which is associated with its motion, while the second term (mc²)² represents the rest energy of the particle, which is associated with its mass. For high-energy nuclear particles, the kinetic energy is typically much larger than the rest energy, so the equation can be approximated as:\n\nE ≈ pc\n\nThis approximation shows that, for high-energy nuclear particles, the energy and momentum are directly proportional, with the proportionality constant being the speed of light."
