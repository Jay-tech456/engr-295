    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe spaceship is traveling at 90% of the speed of light, so its velocity (v) is:\n\nv = 0.9 * c\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9 * c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nK.E. = (2.294 - 1) * 100,000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 1.294 * 100,000 kg * 9 * 10^16 J/kg\nK.E. ≈ 1.1646 * 10^20 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.1646 x 10^20 Joules."
