    "message_2": "In ferromagnetic materials, the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility is described by the Curie-Weiss law. According to this law, the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a ferromagnetic material is inversely proportional to the difference between its temperature (T) and the Curie temperature (Tc), which is the temperature at which the material loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic.\n\nMathematically, the Curie-Weiss law is given by:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ is the magnetic susceptibility, C is the Curie constant, T is the temperature, and Tc is the Curie temperature.\n\nAs the temperature of a ferromagnetic material increases, its magnetic susceptibility decreases. When the temperature reaches the Curie temperature, the material loses its ferromagnetism, and its magnetic susceptibility drops sharply.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the Curie-Weiss law can be found in numerous studies conducted on various ferromagnetic materials. One such example is the study of the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of nickel by Weiss and Piccard in 1917. In their experiment, they measured the magnetic susceptibility of nickel as a function of temperature and found that it followed the Curie-Weiss law, with a Curie temperature of approximately 627 K.\n\nAnother example is the study of iron by Hopkinson in 1890, where he observed that the magnetic susceptibility of iron decreased with increasing temperature and approached zero at the Curie temperature of 1043 K.\n\nThese experimental results, along with many others, provide strong evidence for the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility in ferromagnetic materials as described by the Curie-Weiss law."
