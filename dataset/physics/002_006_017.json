Standard molar Gibbs free energy of combustion of methane is -890.4 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nSince we are given the standard molar Gibbs free energy of combustion of methane (-890.4 kJ/mol), we can use this value as ΔG°. However, we need to convert it to J/mol:\n\nΔG° = -890.4 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ = -890400 J/mol\n\nAssuming the reaction occurs at standard conditions (25°C or 298.15 K), we can use this temperature for T:\n\nT = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we need to determine the reaction quotient, Q. The reaction is:\n\nCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)\n\nThe reaction quotient, Q, is given by:\n\nQ = ([CO2]^2 * [H2O]^4) / ([CH4]^2 * [O2]^4)\n\nSince we are given the moles of each reactant and product, we can assume that the reaction occurs in a 1 L container to simplify the calculation. This means that the concentrations are equal to the moles:\n\n[CH4] = 2 mol/L\n[O2] = 4 mol/L\n[CO2] = 2 mol/L\n[H2O] = 4 mol/L\n\nPlugging these values into the equation for Q:\n\nQ = (2^2 * 4^4) / (2^2 * 4^4) = 1\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the equation for ΔG:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\nΔG = -890400 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(298.15 K) ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔG = -890400 J/mol\n\nThus, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas when 2 moles of methane react with 4 moles of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of carbon dioxide gas and 4 moles of water vapor is -890400 J/mol."
