    "message_2": "To determine the spherical aberration, we first need to find the image distance and magnification. We can use the lens equation to find the image distance:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\n1/10 = 1/5 + 1/di\n\nSolving for di, we get:\n\ndi = 10 cm\n\nNow we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -10/5 = -2\n\nThe magnification is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object. So, the image height is:\n\nhi = M * ho = -2 * 2 = -4 cm\n\nNow, let's find the spherical aberration. Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through different parts of the lens converge at different points along the optical axis. This is caused by the lens's spherical shape.\n\nTo find the spherical aberration, we need to consider the marginal and paraxial rays. Marginal rays pass through the edge of the lens aperture, while paraxial rays pass close to the optical axis. The difference in their focal lengths is the spherical aberration.\n\nFor a thin lens, the spherical aberration (SA) can be approximated using the formula:\n\nSA ≈ (D^2 * do * di) / (32 * f^3)\n\nwhere D is the diameter of the lens aperture.\n\nSA ≈ (4^2 * 5 * 10) / (32 * 10^3) = 0.025 cm\n\nThe spherical aberration for the image produced by the lens is approximately 0.025 cm."
