    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nA toroid has a mean radius of 10 cm and a cross-sectional area of 50 cm². The toroid is wound with 500 turns of wire carrying a current of 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field inside the toroid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it can be represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a toroid, the magnetic field is constant along the circular path around the toroid, so we can simplify the equation as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Mean radius of the toroid (r) = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n- Number of turns of wire (N) = 500 turns\n- Current in the wire (I) = 2 A\n\nSince there are 500 turns of wire, the total enclosed current (I_enclosed) is the product of the number of turns and the current in each turn:\n\nI_enclosed = N * I = 500 turns * 2 A = 1000 A\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B) using the simplified Ampere's Law equation:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1000 A) / (2π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-4) Tm) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 20π × 10^(-4) T\n\nB ≈ 0.0628 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the toroid is approximately 0.0628 Tesla."
