    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of a semiconductor material, we need to know its complex refractive index, which is given by:\n\nn_complex = n + iκ\n\nwhere n is the real part of the refractive index (which we want to find), κ is the extinction coefficient (imaginary part of the refractive index), and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe complex refractive index can be related to the optical constants of the material, such as the dielectric constant (permittivity) ε. The complex dielectric constant is given by:\n\nε_complex = ε_1 + iε_2\n\nwhere ε_1 is the real part of the dielectric constant and ε_2 is the imaginary part.\n\nThe relationship between the complex refractive index and the complex dielectric constant is:\n\nn_complex² = ε_complex\n\nTo find the real part of the refractive index (n), we can use the following relations:\n\nn = sqrt((sqrt(ε_1² + ε_2²) + ε_1) / 2)\nκ = sqrt((sqrt(ε_1² + ε_2²) - ε_1) / 2)\n\nGiven the optical constants (ε_1 and ε_2) and the wavelength of incident light, we can calculate the refractive index (n) using the above formula. Note that the wavelength of incident light is not directly used in the calculation of the refractive index, but it may be relevant if the optical constants are wavelength-dependent. In that case, you would need to know the values of ε_1 and ε_2 at the specific wavelength of interest."
