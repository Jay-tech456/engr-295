    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a velocity of 0.8c relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The spaceship measures 50 meters in length when at rest. What is the length of the spaceship as measured by the stationary observer on Earth when it is moving at this velocity?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length at rest), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, L0 = 50 meters, v = 0.8c, and c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of v^2 / c^2:\n\n(0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can find the value of 1 - v^2 / c^2:\n\n1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNext, we can find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, we can find the contracted length L:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2) = 50 meters * 0.6 = 30 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by the stationary observer on Earth when it is moving at this velocity is 30 meters."
