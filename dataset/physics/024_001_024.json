    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a classic example of a chaotic system, which means that its behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Changing the initial conditions, such as the angle and velocity of the pendulum, can lead to drastically different outcomes in the motion of the system.\n\n1. Angle: The initial angle of the pendulum arms determines the starting position of the system. Even a small change in the initial angle can lead to a completely different trajectory of the double pendulum. This is because the motion of the double pendulum is governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations, which makes the system highly sensitive to initial conditions.\n\n2. Velocity: The initial velocity of the pendulum arms also plays a crucial role in determining the chaotic behavior of the system. A small change in the initial velocity can cause the pendulum to swing in a completely different manner, leading to a different trajectory and final state.\n\nIn summary, changing the initial conditions of a double pendulum system, such as the angle and velocity, can have a significant impact on its chaotic behavior. Due to the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, it is challenging to predict the long-term behavior of the double pendulum accurately. This sensitivity to initial conditions is a hallmark of chaotic systems and is one of the reasons why the double pendulum is often used as an example to study chaos in physics."
