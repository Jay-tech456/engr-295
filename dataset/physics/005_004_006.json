    "message_2": "To find the kinetic energy of the proton, we first need to determine its relativistic mass and then use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. \n\nGiven that the relativistic mass (m_r) is 10 times the rest mass (m_0) of the proton, we have:\n\nm_r = 10 * m_0\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg. Therefore, the relativistic mass is:\n\nm_r = 10 * (1.67 × 10^(-27) kg) = 1.67 × 10^(-26) kg\n\nThe velocity of the proton is given as 0.6 times the speed of light (c), where c ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s. So, the velocity (v) is:\n\nv = 0.6 * c = 0.6 * (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 1.8 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK.E. = (m_r - m_0) * c^2\n\nK.E. = (1.67 × 10^(-26) kg - 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nK.E. = (1.503 × 10^(-26) kg) * (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nK.E. ≈ 1.3527 × 10^(-10) J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 1.3527 × 10^(-10) Joules."
