    "message_1": "What is the total energy that would be released by a supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves if the explosion releases 10% of the energy in the form of gravitational waves and the rest in the form of light and matter? Assume the total energy released by the supernova is 1.2 x 10^44 Joules.",
    "message_2": "To find the total energy released by the supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves, we can use the given information:\n\nTotal energy released by the supernova = 1.2 x 10^44 Joules\nPercentage of energy released as gravitational waves = 10%\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released as gravitational waves:\n\nEnergy released as gravitational waves = (Total energy released) x (Percentage of energy released as gravitational waves) / 100\n\nEnergy released as gravitational waves = (1.2 x 10^44 Joules) x (10 / 100)\n\nEnergy released as gravitational waves = 1.2 x 10^43 Joules\n\nSo, the total energy released by the supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves is 1.2 x 10^43 Joules."
