    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of diffraction for a beam of monochromatic light passing through a slit, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of diffraction, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 600 nm = 600 × 10^(-9) m and the slit width a = 0.2 mm = 0.2 × 10^(-3) m, we can find the minimum angle of diffraction for the first minimum (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.2 × 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 3 × 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(3 × 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 1.72 × 10^(-3) radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor (180°/π):\n\nθ ≈ 1.72 × 10^(-3) * (180/π) ≈ 0.0986°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of diffraction experienced by the beam of monochromatic light is approximately 0.0986°."
