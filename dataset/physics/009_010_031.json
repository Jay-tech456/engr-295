    "message_1": "A student wants to use a concave mirror with a focal length of 15 cm to create an image of an object that is 45 cm away. What is the magnification of the image produced?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image produced, we first need to determine the image distance using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 15 cm and the object distance (do) is 45 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/15 = 1/45 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator (45) and rewrite the equation:\n\n3/45 = 1/45 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/45 from both sides:\n\n2/45 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find di:\n\ndi = 45/2 = 22.5 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values for di and do:\n\nM = -22.5/45\n\nM = -0.5\n\nThe magnification of the image produced is -0.5, which means the image is inverted (due to the negative sign) and reduced in size by a factor of 0.5 (half the size of the object)."
