    "message_2": "To determine the relativistic mass of the particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 2 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity in terms of m/s:\n\nv = 0.8 * c = 0.8 * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 2.4 * 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nm = 2 kg / sqrt(1 - (2.4 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nm = 2 kg / sqrt(1 - (2.4 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2))\n\nm = 2 kg / sqrt(1 - (5.76 * 10^16 m^2/s^2) / (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2))\n\nm = 2 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm = 2 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm = 2 kg / 0.6\n\nm â‰ˆ 3.33 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the particle is approximately 3.33 kg."
