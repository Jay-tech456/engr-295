    "message_2": "To find the numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber, we first need to determine the refractive index of the cladding (n_cladding). We can use Snell's Law and the critical angle to find this value.\n\nSnell's Law states that:\n\nn_core * sin(critical_angle) = n_cladding * sin(90°)\n\nwhere n_core is the refractive index of the core (1.5), critical_angle is given as 42°, and n_cladding is the refractive index of the cladding. Since sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.5 * sin(42°) = n_cladding\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of n_cladding:\n\nn_cladding = 1.5 * sin(42°) ≈ 1.005\n\nNow that we have the refractive index of the cladding, we can find the numerical aperture (NA) using the following formula:\n\nNA = sqrt(n_core^2 - n_cladding^2)\n\nNA = sqrt(1.5^2 - 1.005^2) ≈ sqrt(2.25 - 1.010025) ≈ sqrt(1.239975)\n\nNA ≈ 1.1136\n\nSo, the numerical aperture of the fiber is approximately 1.1136."
