    "message_1": "What is the distance between the two slits required in a double-slit interference experiment, if the distance between the slits and the screen is 1.5 meters and the third-order maximum of the interference pattern is observed at an angle of 30 degrees from the central maximum? The wavelength of the light used is 550 nm.",
    "message_2": "In a double-slit interference experiment, the positions of the maxima (bright fringes) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere m is the order of the maximum (m = 0 for the central maximum, m = 1 for the first maximum, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the slits, and θ is the angle between the maximum and the central maximum.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following information:\n\n- m = 3 (third-order maximum)\n- λ = 550 nm = 550 * 10^(-9) m\n- θ = 30 degrees\n- The distance between the slits and the screen (L) = 1.5 m\n\nWe need to find the distance between the two slits (d). First, we need to convert the angle θ from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the distance between the slits:\n\n3 * (550 * 10^(-9) m) = d * sin(π / 6)\n\nd = (3 * (550 * 10^(-9) m)) / sin(π / 6)\n\nd ≈ (3 * (550 * 10^(-9) m)) / 0.5\n\nd ≈ 3.3 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits required in the double-slit interference experiment is approximately 3.3 μm."
