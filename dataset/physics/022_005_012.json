    "message_2": "There are several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of galaxies are surrounded by dark matter halos:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, including the central SMBH. The gravitational influence of the dark matter halo helps to maintain the observed rotation speeds.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter can bend light due to its gravitational influence, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Observations of strong gravitational lensing events around galaxies have provided evidence for the presence of dark matter halos. These halos are expected to encompass the entire galaxy, including the central SMBH.\n\n3. Galaxy cluster dynamics: The motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters can be used to infer the distribution of mass within the cluster. Observations have shown that the total mass of galaxy clusters is much greater than the mass of the visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter. This dark matter is expected to be distributed throughout the cluster, including around the central SMBHs of individual galaxies.\n\n4. Cosmological simulations: Computer simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters consistently predict the presence of dark matter halos surrounding galaxies, including their central SMBHs. These simulations are based on our current understanding of the laws of physics and the initial conditions of the universe and have been successful in reproducing many observed properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n5. SMBH growth and activity: The growth of SMBHs and their activity, such as the emission of powerful jets and the accretion of matter, can be influenced by the presence of dark matter. Some theoretical models suggest that dark matter halos can provide a source of fuel for SMBHs, helping to explain their rapid growth and the observed correlations between SMBH mass and galaxy properties.\n\nWhile these lines of evidence do not directly prove the presence of dark matter halos around SMBHs, they provide strong support for the hypothesis and are consistent with our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution."
