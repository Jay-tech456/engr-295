The sphere has a radius R and the current is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere. Assume that the point is outside the sphere, i.e., r > R.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r') / |r'|³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the small current element, r' is the vector from the current element to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere, we can find the current density J (current per unit volume) as:\n\nJ = I / (4/3 * π * R³)\n\nNow, let's consider a small volume element dV inside the sphere at a distance r' from the center of the sphere. The current through this volume element is:\n\ndI = J * dV\n\nThe magnetic field due to this small current element at point P located at a distance r from the center of the sphere can be written as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl × r') / |r'|³\n\nSince the sphere is symmetric, the magnetic field at point P will have only a radial component (i.e., along the line connecting the center of the sphere and point P). Therefore, we can write:\n\ndB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * sinθ) / |r'|³\n\nwhere θ is the angle between r' and the radial direction.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire volume of the sphere. The volume element dV can be expressed in spherical coordinates as:\n\ndV = r'^2 * sinθ * dr' * dθ * dφ\n\nSubstituting dI = J * dV and integrating over the entire volume of the sphere, we get:\n\nB_radial = ∫∫∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (J * r'^2 * sinθ * dr' * dθ * dφ * dl * sinθ) / |r'|³\n\nThe limits of integration are:\n- r' from 0 to R\n- θ from 0 to π\n- φ from 0 to 2π\n\nBefore integrating, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ * J * dl) / (4π) * ∫∫∫ (r'^2 * sin²θ * dr' * dθ * dφ) / |r'|³\n\nNow, let's perform the integration:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ * J * dl) / (4π) * [∫(r'² / r'³) dr' from 0 to R] * [∫sin²θ dθ from 0 to π] * [∫dφ from 0 to 2π]\n\nThe integrals can be solved as:\n\n∫(r'² / r'³) dr' = -1/r' | from 0 to R = -1/R\n∫sin²θ dθ = (π / 2) | from 0 to π = π/2\n∫dφ = φ | from 0 to 2π = 2π\n\nSubstituting the results of the integrals back into the expression for B_radial, we get:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ * J * dl) / (4π) * (-1/R) * (π/2) * (2π)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nB_radial = -(μ₀ * J * dl) / (8R)\n\nNow, substituting the expression for J:\n\nB_radial = -(μ₀ * I * dl) / (8R * (4/3 * π * R³))\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nB_radial = -(3 * μ₀ * I * dl) / (32 * π * R²)\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance r from the center of the sphere is:\n\n|B_radial| = (3 * μ₀ * I * dl) / (32 * π * R²)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is radial (along the line connecting the center of the sphere and point P).\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located at a distance r from the center of the sphere carrying a steady current I is:\n\nB_radial = (3 * μ₀ * I * dl) / (32 * π * R²) in the radial direction."
