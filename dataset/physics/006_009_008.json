    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula, which relates the change in wavelength of a scattered photon to the scattering angle and the initial wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle (45 degrees in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial wavelength from nm to meters:\n\n0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, let's convert the scattering angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45 degrees * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/4))\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m * (1 - 0.707)\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m * 0.293\nΔλ ≈ 7.11 x 10^-13 m\n\nThe change in wavelength is approximately 7.11 x 10^-13 m or 0.711 pm (picometers)."
