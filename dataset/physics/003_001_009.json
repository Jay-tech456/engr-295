    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from a long, straight wire carrying a current of 3 A, we can use Ampere's Law, specifically the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current (3 A), and\nr is the distance from the wire (0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T * 3) / (2 * 0.05)\n\nNow, calculating the magnetic field:\n\nB ≈ (1.2 × 10^(-6) T) / 0.1\nB ≈ 1.2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the wire is approximately 1.2 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be circulating around the wire in concentric circles."
