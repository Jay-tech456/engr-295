    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship, we need to use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the spaceship at rest, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.8c).\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / √(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc²\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1)(1000 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667 × 1000 kg × (9 × 10^16 m²/s²)\nK.E. ≈ 6 × 10^16 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 6 × 10^16 Joules."
