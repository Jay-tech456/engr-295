    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nGiven:\nResistivity (ρ) = 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m\nLength (L) = 2 meters\nCross-sectional Area (A) = 3 mm² = 3 × 10⁻⁶ m² (converting to square meters)\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m) × (2 m) / (3 × 10⁻⁶ m²)\nR = 3.36 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m / 3 × 10⁻⁶ m²\nR = 1.12 × 10⁻² Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nSince we know the resistivity of copper at 25 °C:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m)\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10⁷ S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire at 25 °C is approximately 5.95 × 10⁷ S/m."
