    "message_2": "Experimental evidence supporting the existence of dark matter comes from various observations in astrophysics and cosmology. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that the mass distribution in galaxies is not consistent with the visible matter alone. The outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects indicate that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter, again pointing to the existence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations provide information about the density and composition of the universe. These measurements indicate that about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content is in the form of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that match the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nDark matter is believed to interact with normal matter primarily through gravity. However, it is also hypothesized that dark matter may interact via other forces, such as the weak nuclear force. This has led to the proposal of various dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos.\n\nDetecting and measuring dark matter interactions with normal matter is challenging due to their weak nature. Several experimental approaches have been developed to search for these interactions:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei in highly sensitive detectors. Examples of direct detection experiments include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the XENON1T experiment, and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS).\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples of indirect detection experiments include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in collisions between normal matter particles. By studying the products of these collisions, physicists can search for signs of dark matter production.\n\n4. Astrophysical observations: Observations of astrophysical phenomena, such as galaxy collisions or the dynamics of galaxy clusters, can provide indirect evidence for dark matter interactions with normal matter. For example, the Bullet Cluster, a system of colliding galaxy clusters, provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter through its gravitational lensing effects and the separation of visible and dark matter components."
