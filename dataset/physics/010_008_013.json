    "message_2": "According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force (upward force) experienced by an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the object is completely submerged in water, so the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the object.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the water displaced. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nmass = density × volume\n\nSince the volume of the object is equal to the volume of the water displaced, we can denote the volume as V. The mass of the water displaced can be calculated as:\n\nmass_water = density_water × V\nmass_water = 1000 kg/m³ × V\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the water displaced, which is the buoyant force experienced by the object. Weight is the product of mass and gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s²):\n\nweight_water = mass_water × g\nweight_water = (1000 kg/m³ × V) × 9.81 m/s²\n\nThe buoyant force experienced by the object is equal to the weight of the water displaced:\n\nbuoyant_force = weight_water\nbuoyant_force = (1000 kg/m³ × V) × 9.81 m/s²\n\nSince the object is completely submerged in water, the buoyant force is the force experienced by the object. Therefore, the force experienced by the object is:\n\nforce = (1000 kg/m³ × V) × 9.81 m/s²"
