    "message_1": "A laser beam of wavelength 650 nm shines onto a single slit with a width of 0.10 mm. The diffraction pattern is projected onto a screen 1.5 meters away. What is the distance between the central maximum and the second minimum?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum, m = 2 for the second minimum, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\nSlit width (a) = 0.10 mm = 0.10 * 10^(-3) m\nDistance to screen (L) = 1.5 m\n\nNow, we will find the angular position of the second minimum (m = 2):\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\nθ = (2 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.10 * 10^(-3))\nθ = 1.3 * 10^(-5) rad\n\nNow, we will use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance (y) between the central maximum and the second minimum on the screen:\n\ny = L * θ\ny = 1.5 * 1.3 * 10^(-5)\ny ≈ 1.95 * 10^(-5) m\n\nConverting the result to millimeters:\n\ny ≈ 1.95 * 10^(-5) * 10^3\ny ≈ 0.0195 mm\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the second minimum is approximately 0.0195 mm."
