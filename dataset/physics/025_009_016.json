    "message_2": "The relationship between sound frequency and pitch perception in the human ear is directly proportional. Frequency refers to the number of cycles of a sound wave that occur in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Pitch, on the other hand, is the subjective perception of the frequency of a sound by the human ear.\n\nAs the frequency of a sound wave increases, the pitch of the sound is perceived as higher. Conversely, as the frequency decreases, the pitch is perceived as lower. The human ear can typically detect frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, with the most sensitive range being between 2,000 Hz and 4,000 Hz.\n\nIt is important to note that pitch perception can be influenced by several factors, including the individual's hearing ability, the presence of other sounds, and the loudness of the sound. However, in general, the relationship between sound frequency and pitch perception remains directly proportional."
