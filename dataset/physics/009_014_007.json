    "message_2": "Chromatic aberration occurs when a lens fails to focus all colors at the same point due to the variation in refractive index for different wavelengths of light. In this problem, we are given the refractive indices for red and violet light, and we need to calculate the chromatic aberration, which is the difference in focal lengths for these two colors.\n\nTo calculate the focal length for each color, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nHere, f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since we are not given the radii of curvature, we can rewrite the formula in terms of the focal length for one color and the ratio of the refractive indices for the two colors:\n\nf_violet / f_red = (n_red - 1) / (n_violet - 1)\n\nWe are given the focal length for the lens (f = 10 cm) and the refractive indices for red (n_red = 1.5) and violet (n_violet = 1.65) light. We can assume that the given focal length corresponds to the red light, so f_red = 10 cm. Now we can solve for the focal length of the violet light:\n\nf_violet / 10 cm = (1.5 - 1) / (1.65 - 1)\nf_violet / 10 cm = 0.5 / 0.65\nf_violet = 10 cm * (0.5 / 0.65)\nf_violet ≈ 7.69 cm\n\nNow that we have the focal lengths for both red and violet light, we can calculate the chromatic aberration, which is the difference in focal lengths:\n\nChromatic aberration = |f_red - f_violet|\nChromatic aberration = |10 cm - 7.69 cm|\nChromatic aberration ≈ 2.31 cm\n\nThe chromatic aberration for the lens is approximately 2.31 cm."
