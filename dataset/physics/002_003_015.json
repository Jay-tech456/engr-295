    "message_1": "A 0.50 kg block of copper has an initial temperature of 25°C. If 500 J of heat energy is added to it, what is the final temperature of the copper block? (Assume that the specific heat capacity of copper is 386 J/kg°C and neglect any other heat losses or gains to the surroundings.)",
    "message_2": "To find the final temperature of the copper block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy added (500 J), m is the mass of the copper block (0.50 kg), c is the specific heat capacity of copper (386 J/kg°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = Q / (mc)\n\nΔT = 500 J / (0.50 kg × 386 J/kg°C)\n\nΔT = 500 J / 193 J/°C\n\nΔT ≈ 2.59°C\n\nNow, we can find the final temperature by adding the initial temperature to the change in temperature:\n\nFinal temperature = Initial temperature + ΔT\n\nFinal temperature = 25°C + 2.59°C\n\nFinal temperature ≈ 27.59°C\n\nSo, the final temperature of the copper block is approximately 27.59°C."
