    "message_2": "According to the theory of General Relativity, a star will undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole if its mass is above a certain threshold called the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is the maximum mass that a stable neutron star can have before it collapses under its own gravity to form a black hole.\n\nThe exact value of the TOV limit is not precisely known, as it depends on the equation of state of neutron star matter, which is still an area of active research. However, current estimates place the TOV limit at around 2 to 3 solar masses. This means that a main-sequence star with an initial mass of at least 20-30 solar masses is likely to undergo a gravitational collapse and form a black hole after it exhausts its nuclear fuel and goes through a supernova explosion. The exact mass threshold for a star to form a black hole depends on various factors, including its composition and the details of its evolution."
