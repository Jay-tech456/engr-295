    "message_2": "To see the full reflection of their body in a plane mirror, the minimum height of the mirror should be half the height of the person. This is because the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the person's eyes are approximately at the halfway point of their height. So, if a person is H meters tall, the minimum height of the mirror should be H/2 meters."
