    "message_2": "The cosmic web structure is a large-scale organization of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and dark matter in the universe, forming a complex network of interconnected filaments and voids. The distribution of dark matter plays a crucial role in shaping this cosmic web.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, it is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. Its existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the bending of light from distant objects.\n\nThe relation between the cosmic web structure and the distribution of dark matter can be understood through the process of structure formation in the universe. After the Big Bang, the universe was filled with a nearly uniform distribution of matter, including both ordinary (baryonic) matter and dark matter. As the universe expanded and cooled, tiny fluctuations in the density of matter began to grow under the influence of gravity.\n\nDark matter, being more abundant and less affected by other forces (such as radiation pressure), began to clump together first, forming a gravitational scaffold for the cosmic web. The gravitational pull of these dark matter halos attracted baryonic matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters along the densest regions of the dark matter distribution.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the relation between the cosmic web structure and the distribution of dark matter:\n\n1. Observations of galaxy distributions: Large-scale surveys of galaxies, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have revealed a cosmic web-like structure in the distribution of galaxies, consistent with the predictions of dark matter-driven structure formation.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant objects by the gravitational influence of massive structures can be used to map the distribution of dark matter. Studies using gravitational lensing have found that the distribution of dark matter aligns with the observed cosmic web structure.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB temperature are consistent with the initial density fluctuations that led to the formation of the cosmic web and support the role of dark matter in this process.\n\n4. Computer simulations: Advanced computer simulations, such as the Millennium Simulation and the Illustris Project, have modeled the evolution of the universe, including the role of dark matter in the formation of the cosmic web. These simulations produce structures that closely resemble the observed cosmic web.\n\nIn conclusion, the cosmic web structure is intimately connected to the distribution of dark matter in the universe. Dark matter provides the gravitational backbone for the formation of the cosmic web, and observational evidence from galaxy surveys, gravitational lensing, CMB radiation, and computer simulations support this connection."
