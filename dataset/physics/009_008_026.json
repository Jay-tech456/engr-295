    "message_2": "As an AI, I am unable to draw diagrams. However, I can help you understand how to draw the ray diagram and determine the image location and its characteristics.\n\nTo draw a ray diagram for an object placed 10 cm in front of a concave mirror with a focal length of 15 cm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a concave mirror and mark its center (C) and the focal point (F) at 15 cm from the center.\n2. Place the object (O) at 10 cm from the mirror.\n3. Draw a horizontal line from the object (O) to the mirror. This represents the incident ray parallel to the principal axis.\n4. Reflect the ray from the mirror through the focal point (F). This is the reflected ray.\n5. Draw another ray from the object (O) through the focal point (F) to the mirror. This represents the incident ray passing through the focal point.\n6. Reflect the ray from the mirror parallel to the principal axis. This is the reflected ray.\n7. The point where the two reflected rays intersect is the location of the image (I).\n\nNow, to find the image location and its characteristics, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = -30 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it's a virtual image. The image distance is 30 cm from the mirror.\n\nTo find the magnification (m), use the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = -(-30)/(-10) = 3\n\nThe magnification is 3, which means the image is 3 times larger than the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is located 30 cm in front of the mirror, it's virtual, upright, and 3 times larger than the object."
