    "message_2": "To find the angular separation between the first and second order maxima, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the maxima, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines in the grating, and θ is the angle of the maxima.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines in the grating. Since there are 1000 lines per millimeter, the distance between the lines is:\n\nd = 1 / 1000 lines per millimeter = 0.001 mm = 1 x 10^-6 m\n\nNow, we can find the angles for the first and second order maxima using the diffraction grating equation. For the first order maxima (n = 1):\n\n1 * 650 x 10^-9 m = 1 x 10^-6 m * sin(θ1)\n\nSolving for θ1, we get:\n\nsin(θ1) = 650 x 10^-9 m / 1 x 10^-6 m = 0.65\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.65) ≈ 40.5°\n\nFor the second order maxima (n = 2):\n\n2 * 650 x 10^-9 m = 1 x 10^-6 m * sin(θ2)\n\nSolving for θ2, we get:\n\nsin(θ2) = 1300 x 10^-9 m / 1 x 10^-6 m = 1.3\n\nHowever, the sine function cannot have a value greater than 1, which means that there is no second order maxima for this diffraction grating and wavelength combination. Therefore, there is no angular separation between the first and second order maxima in this case."
