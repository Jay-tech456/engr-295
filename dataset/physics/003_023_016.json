    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven:\nI = 5 A (current)\nr = 15 cm = 0.15 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^-7 T) / (0.3 m)\n\nB = (20/0.3) × 10^-7 T\n\nB ≈ 6.67 × 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire is approximately 6.67 × 10^-6 Tesla."
