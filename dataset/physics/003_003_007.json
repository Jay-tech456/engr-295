    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a point located on the axis of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law. The magnetic field (B) inside a toroid is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the radius of the toroid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field strength inside the toroid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 200 turns * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m)\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 A) / (0.4π m)\nB_inside = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 A) / (0.4 m)\nB_inside ≈ 0.01 T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field strength at a point located on the axis of the toroid, at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the toroid. To do this, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength outside the toroid:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * N * I * a^2) / (2 * π * (a^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere a is the radius of the toroid, x is the distance from the center of the toroid, and the other variables are the same as before.\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 200 turns * 10 A * (0.2 m)^2) / (2 * π * ((0.2 m)^2 + (0.1 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 A * 0.04 m^2) / (2 * π * (0.05 m^2)^(3/2))\nB_outside = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 80 A) / (2 * π * (0.05 m^2)^(3/2))\nB_outside ≈ 0.002 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point located on the axis of the toroid, at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the toroid, is approximately 0.002 T."
