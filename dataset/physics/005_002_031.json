    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship according to the observer on Earth, we need to use the formula for length contraction in a moving frame of reference, which is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length at rest), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nL0 = 30 meters\nv = 0.5c\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = 30 * sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2)\nL = 30 * sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nL = 30 * sqrt(0.75)\n\nCalculating the contracted length:\n\nL ≈ 30 * 0.866\nL ≈ 25.98 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship according to the observer on Earth is approximately 25.98 meters."
