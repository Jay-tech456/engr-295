    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the distribution of matter in the universe and plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters and filaments. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter.\n\nDark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (baryonic matter) accounts for only about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nThe role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures can be explained through the following points:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter, due to its mass, exerts gravitational forces on surrounding matter. This gravitational attraction causes both dark matter and baryonic matter to clump together, forming the seeds of large-scale structures.\n\n2. Formation of cosmic web: As dark matter clumps together, it forms a cosmic web-like structure, with dense regions connected by filaments and surrounded by vast voids. Baryonic matter, attracted by the gravitational pull of dark matter, follows this web-like pattern, eventually forming galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters along the filaments.\n\n3. Stability of galaxies and galaxy clusters: The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies and galaxy clusters provides additional mass, which helps to stabilize these structures against gravitational collapse. Without dark matter, the observed rotation curves of galaxies and the velocities of galaxies within clusters could not be explained by the mass of visible matter alone.\n\n4. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations: The distribution of dark matter also affects the pattern of temperature fluctuations in the CMB, the relic radiation from the early universe. The observed patterns in the CMB are consistent with the predictions of a universe dominated by dark matter and dark energy, providing further evidence for the role of dark matter in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and filaments. Its gravitational influence helps to shape the cosmic web, stabilize galaxies and galaxy clusters, and is consistent with observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background."
