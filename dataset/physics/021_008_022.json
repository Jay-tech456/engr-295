    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and wavelength of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the orbital frequency of the black holes before the merger:\n\nThe orbital frequency (f) of two black holes in a circular orbit can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * (M1 + M2) / R^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes, and R is the distance between them before the merger.\n\n2. Calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves (fgw) is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nfgw = 2 * f\n\n3. Calculate the wavelength of the gravitational waves:\n\nThe speed of gravitational waves (c) is equal to the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s). The wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nλ = c / fgw\n\n4. Calculate the final mass of the merged black hole:\n\nThe final mass (Mf) of the merged black hole can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nMf = M1 + M2 - ΔE / c^2\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy radiated as gravitational waves during the merger. The energy radiated can be estimated using numerical simulations or approximated using the following formula:\n\nΔE ≈ 0.1 * (M1 * M2) / (M1 + M2)\n\n5. Calculate the final orbital frequency and wavelength:\n\nAfter the merger, the final orbital frequency (ff) and wavelength (λf) can be calculated using the same formulas as before, but with the final mass (Mf) and the final distance (Rf) between the black holes after the merger.\n\nff = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * Mf / Rf^3)\nλf = c / (2 * ff)\n\nThese calculations provide an estimate of the frequency and wavelength of the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes. Keep in mind that these are simplified formulas, and more accurate results can be obtained using numerical simulations and general relativity."
