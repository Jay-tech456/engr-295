    "message_1": "What is the critical Mach number for a plane flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters where the air temperature is -50° Celsius? If the plane is flying at a velocity of 350 meters per second, will it experience a shock wave at this altitude? (Assume the specific heat ratio of air to be 1.4)",
    "message_2": "To find the critical Mach number, we first need to determine the speed of sound at the given altitude and temperature. The speed of sound in air can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = sqrt(γ * R * T)\n\nwhere a is the speed of sound, γ is the specific heat ratio (1.4 for air), R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = -50°C + 273.15 = 223.15 K\n\nNow, calculate the speed of sound:\n\na = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 223.15) ≈ 295.07 m/s\n\nNext, we can find the Mach number (M) by dividing the velocity of the plane (V) by the speed of sound (a):\n\nM = V / a = 350 m/s / 295.07 m/s ≈ 1.186\n\nThe critical Mach number is 1.186. Since the Mach number is greater than 1, the plane is flying at a supersonic speed, and it will experience a shock wave at this altitude."
