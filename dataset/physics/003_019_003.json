    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor of radius 'a' and an outer conductor of radius 'b'. A current 'I' flows through the inner conductor in the positive z-direction. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance 'r' from the center of the coaxial cable, where 'a<r<b'.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance 'r' from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed).\n\n∮ B⋅dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nWe consider a circular loop of radius 'r' centered on the axis of the coaxial cable. Since the magnetic field is azimuthal (in the φ direction) and has the same magnitude at all points on the loop, we can write the line integral as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the loop of radius 'r'. Since the current is uniformly distributed over the inner conductor with radius 'a', the current density (J) can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / (πa²)\n\nThe enclosed current within the loop of radius 'r' can be found by multiplying the current density by the area enclosed by the loop:\n\nI_enclosed = J * πr² = (I / πa²) * πr²\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for I_enclosed back into Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * ((I / πa²) * πr²)\n\nWe can now solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πa²)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a distance 'r' from the center of the coaxial cable, where 'a<r<b'."
