    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given that the solenoid has 1000 turns and a length of 50 cm (0.5 m). Therefore, the number of turns per unit length is:\n\nn = total turns / length\nn = 1000 turns / 0.5 m\nn = 2000 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2000 turns/m) * (0.5 A)\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ Tm/A) * (2000 turns/m) * (0.5 A)\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 1.2566 × 10⁻³ T or 1.2566 mT."
