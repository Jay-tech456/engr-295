    "message_2": "To determine the change in energy level of a hydrogen atom when subjected to a static electric field, we need to consider the Stark effect. The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. For hydrogen, we will consider the linear Stark effect, which occurs when the electric field is much weaker than the internal electric field of the atom.\n\nThe change in energy level can be calculated using the first-order perturbation theory. The perturbation Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in an electric field E is given by:\n\nH' = -e * E * z\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), E is the electric field strength (10 kV/m = 10^4 V/m), and z is the position of the electron along the field direction.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, we can use the unperturbed wavefunctions of the form:\n\nψ_nlm = R_nl(r) * Y_lm(θ, φ)\n\nwhere n, l, and m are the principal, azimuthal, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively, R_nl(r) is the radial wavefunction, and Y_lm(θ, φ) is the spherical harmonic function.\n\nThe change in energy ΔE can be calculated using first-order perturbation theory:\n\nΔE = <ψ_nlm|H'|ψ_nlm>\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the Stark effect causes the energy levels to split, and the splitting depends on the quantum numbers n, l, and m. The selection rules for the Stark effect are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, which means that only transitions with a change in the azimuthal quantum number by ±1 and no change in the magnetic quantum number are allowed.\n\nTo calculate the change in energy, we need to evaluate the matrix elements of the perturbation Hamiltonian. This involves integrating the product of the unperturbed wavefunctions and the perturbation Hamiltonian over all space. The result will depend on the specific values of n, l, and m.\n\nThe change in energy levels corresponds to the spectral lines observed in the Stark effect. When the energy levels split, the spectral lines will also split into multiple components. The number of components and their spacing depend on the quantum numbers n, l, and m, as well as the strength of the electric field. In general, the Stark effect causes the spectral lines to broaden and shift, which can be observed experimentally.\n\nIn summary, to determine the change in energy level of a hydrogen atom subjected to a static electric field of 10 kV/m and the corresponding spectral lines, one needs to calculate the matrix elements of the perturbation Hamiltonian using first-order perturbation theory and consider the selection rules for the Stark effect. The resulting energy level splitting and shifts will be reflected in the observed spectral lines."
