    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of flow of the liquid through the tube, we can use Poiseuille's law for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube. Poiseuille's law is given by:\n\nQ = (π * r^4 * ΔP) / (8 * η * L)\n\nwhere:\nQ is the flow rate (m³/s)\nr is the radius of the tube (m)\nΔP is the pressure difference between the ends of the tube (Pa)\nη is the viscosity of the liquid (Pa.s)\nL is the length of the tube (m)\n\nWe are given the inner diameter of the tube (0.1 cm), so we can calculate the radius:\n\nr = diameter / 2 = 0.1 cm / 2 = 0.05 cm = 0.0005 m\n\nWe are also given the viscosity of the liquid (1.5 Pa.s) and the pressure difference between the ends of the tube (4 Pa). However, we are not given the length of the tube (L). Since we cannot solve for the flow rate without knowing the length of the tube, let's assume the length is L meters.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into Poiseuille's law:\n\nQ = (π * (0.0005 m)^4 * 4 Pa) / (8 * 1.5 Pa.s * L)\n\nQ = (π * 6.25 * 10^(-16) m^4 * 4 Pa) / (12 Pa.s * L)\n\nQ = (π * 2.5 * 10^(-15) m^4 * Pa) / (Pa.s * L)\n\nSince we don't have the value of L, we can express the flow rate Q as a function of L:\n\nQ(L) = (π * 2.5 * 10^(-15) m^4 * Pa) / (Pa.s * L)\n\nThis equation gives us the flow rate of the liquid through the tube as a function of the tube's length. To find the actual flow rate, we would need to know the length of the tube."
