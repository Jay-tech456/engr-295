    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a B meson decaying into a specific final state X, we need to know the branching ratio of this decay. The branching ratio is the fraction of B meson decays that result in the specific final state X.\n\nFirst, we need to collect data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the number of B meson decays and the number of decays into the specific final state X. Let's assume we have the following data:\n\n- Total number of B meson decays observed (N_total): 1,000,000\n- Number of B meson decays into the specific final state X (N_X): 100\n\nNow, we can calculate the branching ratio (BR) of the decay into final state X:\n\nBR = N_X / N_total\nBR = 100 / 1,000,000\nBR = 0.0001\n\nSo, the branching ratio of this rare decay is 0.0001 or 0.01%.\n\nNext, we need to compare this experimental result with the theoretical prediction. Let's assume the theoretical prediction for the branching ratio of this decay is 0.00012 or 0.012%.\n\nTo compare the experimental result with the theoretical prediction, we can calculate the relative difference:\n\nRelative difference = (Experimental BR - Theoretical BR) / Theoretical BR\nRelative difference = (0.0001 - 0.00012) / 0.00012\nRelative difference = -0.00002 / 0.00012\nRelative difference = -0.1667\n\nThe relative difference between the experimental result and the theoretical prediction is -16.67%. This means that the experimental result is 16.67% lower than the theoretical prediction. Further analysis and more data may be needed to determine if this discrepancy is due to experimental uncertainties, statistical fluctuations, or an indication of new physics beyond the current theoretical framework."
