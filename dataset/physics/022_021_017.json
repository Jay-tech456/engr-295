    "message_2": "The predicted mass range of extra-dimensional particles that could comprise dark matter varies depending on the specific theoretical model being considered. One popular class of extra-dimensional particles is known as Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles, which arise in theories with extra spatial dimensions beyond the familiar three dimensions of space. In these models, the lightest KK particle (LKP) is often considered a dark matter candidate.\n\nThe mass range for the LKP depends on the size and geometry of the extra dimensions, as well as the details of the underlying theory. Generally, the mass of the LKP is expected to be in the range of a few hundred GeV (gigaelectronvolts) to a few TeV (teraelectronvolts). This is comparable to the mass range of other popular dark matter candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).\n\nThe evidence for extra-dimensional particles as dark matter candidates is indirect and comes from several sources:\n\n1. Theoretical motivation: Extra-dimensional theories, such as string theory and certain extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, provide a natural framework for the existence of dark matter particles. These theories can address some of the outstanding problems in particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem, and can potentially unify the fundamental forces of nature.\n\n2. Cosmological observations: The observed abundance of dark matter in the universe, as inferred from the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, can be consistent with the predicted relic abundance of extra-dimensional particles, such as the LKP.\n\n3. Collider experiments: While no direct evidence for extra-dimensional particles has been found so far, experiments at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are actively searching for signatures of these particles. The discovery of extra-dimensional particles at the LHC would provide strong support for the idea that they could be dark matter candidates.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range of extra-dimensional particles that could comprise dark matter is typically in the range of a few hundred GeV to a few TeV, depending on the specific model. While there is no direct evidence for these particles yet, their existence is motivated by theoretical considerations and is consistent with cosmological observations. Ongoing experiments at particle colliders are searching for direct evidence of extra-dimensional particles, which would strengthen the case for them as dark matter candidates."
