    "message_2": "The lifetime of a star is primarily determined by its mass and the rate at which it consumes its nuclear fuel. The more massive a star is, the shorter its lifetime. The lifetime of a star can be estimated using the following relation:\n\nLifetime ≈ (Solar Mass / Star Mass)^2.5 * Solar Lifetime\n\nFor a star with a mass of 10 solar masses, we can calculate its lifetime as follows:\n\nLifetime ≈ (1 / 10)^2.5 * 10 billion years\nLifetime ≈ 0.0316 * 10 billion years\nLifetime ≈ 316 million years\n\nSo, the lifetime of a star with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 316 million years.\n\nNow, let's discuss the nucleosynthesis pathway of a 10 solar mass star compared to a lower mass star like the Sun.\n\n1. Hydrogen burning: Both the Sun and a 10 solar mass star start their lives by burning hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain (in the case of the Sun) or the CNO cycle (in the case of the more massive star). The CNO cycle is more temperature-sensitive, so it dominates in more massive stars.\n\n2. Helium burning: Once the hydrogen in the core is depleted, both types of stars start burning helium into carbon and oxygen through the triple-alpha process. However, in the more massive star, this process occurs more rapidly due to higher core temperatures and pressures.\n\n3. Advanced nuclear burning stages: After helium burning, the nucleosynthesis pathways diverge significantly. In a star like the Sun, the core contracts, and the outer layers expand, turning the star into a red giant. The Sun will eventually shed its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula, and leave behind a white dwarf composed mostly of carbon and oxygen.\n\nIn a 10 solar mass star, the core continues to contract and heat up, igniting further nuclear reactions. Carbon burning occurs, producing neon, magnesium, and heavier elements. This is followed by neon burning, which produces oxygen and heavier elements, and then oxygen burning, which produces silicon, sulfur, and other elements. Finally, silicon burning occurs, producing iron and other heavy elements.\n\n4. Supernova and remnant: Unlike the Sun, a 10 solar mass star will end its life in a core-collapse supernova. The iron core collapses under gravity, and the outer layers of the star are ejected in a massive explosion. The supernova produces and disperses many heavy elements into the surrounding interstellar medium. Depending on the mass of the core, the remnant left behind can be either a neutron star or a black hole.\n\nIn summary, a 10 solar mass star has a shorter lifetime than a lower mass star like the Sun, and its nucleosynthesis pathway involves more advanced nuclear burning stages, ultimately leading to a core-collapse supernova and the formation of a neutron star or black hole."
