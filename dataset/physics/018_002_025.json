    "message_2": "The primary process of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) through which quarks and gluons interact to form composite hadrons is called confinement. Confinement is the phenomenon where quarks and gluons are permanently bound together within hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, and cannot be isolated as free particles.\n\nThe theoretical framework that describes this process mathematically is called non-abelian gauge theory, specifically, the SU(3) gauge theory. In this framework, quarks and gluons carry a \"color charge\" (analogous to electric charge in electromagnetism) that comes in three varieties: red, green, and blue. The strong force between quarks and gluons is mediated by the exchange of gluons, which themselves carry color charge.\n\nThe key feature of QCD that leads to confinement is asymptotic freedom, which means that the strong force becomes weaker at short distances (or high energies) and stronger at long distances (or low energies). This behavior prevents quarks and gluons from being separated from each other, as the energy required to do so would create new quark-antiquark pairs, resulting in the formation of new hadrons.\n\nThe mathematical description of QCD is based on the Lagrangian formalism, which encodes the dynamics of quarks and gluons in terms of their fields and interactions. The QCD Lagrangian includes terms for the kinetic energy of quarks and gluons, as well as their interactions through the strong force. The equations of motion derived from this Lagrangian are highly non-linear and difficult to solve, so various approximation techniques, such as lattice QCD and perturbation theory, are employed to study the properties of hadrons and their interactions."
