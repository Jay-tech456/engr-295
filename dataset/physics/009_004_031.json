    "message_1": "A light ray travels from air (n=1.00) into a material with an index of refraction of 1.30. What is the critical angle for this situation?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law, which states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the index of refraction of air (1.00), and n2 is the index of refraction of the material (1.30). The critical angle (θc) occurs when the light ray is refracted at a 90-degree angle (θ2 = 90°) along the boundary of the two materials. At this point, sin(θ2) = sin(90°) = 1.\n\nSo, we can rewrite Snell's Law for the critical angle as:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for n1 and n2:\n\n1.00 * sin(θc) = 1.30\n\nTo solve for the critical angle (θc), we can divide both sides by n1:\n\nsin(θc) = 1.30 / 1.00\nsin(θc) = 1.30\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine (arcsin) of 1.30:\n\nθc = arcsin(1.30)\n\nHowever, the sine function cannot have a value greater than 1, so there is no real critical angle in this situation. This means that the light ray will always be refracted when entering the material, and there will be no total internal reflection."
