    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Dark matter influences the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, which in turn affects the CMB temperature fluctuations.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is the relic radiation from the Big Bang, and it provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only about 380,000 years old. The temperature fluctuations in the CMB are related to the density fluctuations in the early universe, which eventually led to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nDark matter, which is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, interacts only through gravity and does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. It plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures by providing additional gravitational force to pull matter together.\n\nThe evidence for the impact of dark matter on the CMB temperature fluctuations comes from the analysis of the CMB power spectrum. The power spectrum shows the distribution of temperature fluctuations at different angular scales on the sky. The presence of dark matter affects the shape of the power spectrum, particularly the relative heights and positions of the peaks.\n\nThe first peak in the power spectrum corresponds to the largest scale of fluctuations, which are related to the overall geometry and content of the universe. The subsequent peaks are related to the oscillations of the photon-baryon fluid in the early universe, which are influenced by the presence of dark matter.\n\nObservations of the CMB power spectrum by satellites such as COBE, WMAP, and Planck have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The data from these missions show a good agreement between the observed power spectrum and the theoretical predictions that include dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter affects the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation by influencing the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. The evidence for this impact comes from the analysis of the CMB power spectrum, which shows a good agreement between the observed data and the theoretical predictions that include dark matter."
