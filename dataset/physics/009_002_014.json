    "message_1": "A ray of light travels from a medium with an index of refraction of 1.5 to another medium with an unknown index of refraction. If the angle of incidence is 30 degrees and the angle of refraction is 20 degrees, what is the index of refraction of the second medium according to Snell's Law?",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nGiven that n1 = 1.5, θ1 = 30 degrees, and θ2 = 20 degrees, we can solve for n2:\n\n1.5 * sin(30) = n2 * sin(20)\n\n1.5 * 0.5 = n2 * 0.342\n\n0.75 = n2 * 0.342\n\nn2 = 0.75 / 0.342\n\nn2 ≈ 2.19\n\nSo, the index of refraction of the second medium is approximately 2.19."
