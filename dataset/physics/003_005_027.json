    "message_1": "A straight wire carrying a current of 5 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.6 T. Calculate the magnetic force per unit length on the wire if the wire is placed at an angle of 45 degrees to the direction of the magnetic field.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic force per unit length on the wire, we can use the formula:\n\nF/L = I * B * sin(θ)\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, L is the length of the wire, I is the current, B is the magnetic field, and θ is the angle between the wire and the magnetic field.\n\nGiven:\nI = 5 A\nB = 0.6 T\nθ = 45 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (radians) = θ (degrees) * (π/180)\nθ (radians) = 45 * (π/180) = π/4\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nF/L = (5 A) * (0.6 T) * sin(π/4)\nF/L = 3 * (1/√2)  (since sin(π/4) = 1/√2)\nF/L ≈ 3 * 0.7071\nF/L ≈ 2.1213 N/m\n\nSo, the magnetic force per unit length on the wire is approximately 2.1213 N/m."
