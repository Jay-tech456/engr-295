    "message_2": "When two waves with equal amplitude, frequency, and wavelength intersect at a 90-degree angle, the resulting interference pattern can be described using the principle of superposition. In a non-relativistic scenario, the amplitude of the resulting wave would be the vector sum of the amplitudes of the two waves, and the phase shift would depend on the relative phase of the two waves.\n\nHowever, in a relativistic scenario where the observer's velocity is close to the speed of light, the Doppler effect comes into play. The Doppler effect causes the observed frequency and wavelength of the waves to change due to the relative motion between the observer and the source of the waves.\n\nTo analyze this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler formula:\n\nf_obs = f_src * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f_obs is the observed frequency, f_src is the source frequency, and β = v/c, with v being the observer's velocity and c being the speed of light.\n\nAs the observer's velocity approaches the speed of light (v -> c), β approaches 1, and the observed frequency becomes very large. This means that the interference pattern will be significantly different from the non-relativistic case.\n\nThe amplitude of the resulting wave will still be the vector sum of the amplitudes of the two waves, but the phase shift will be affected by the Doppler effect. The phase shift will depend on the relative phase of the two waves as well as the observer's velocity. As the observer's velocity approaches the speed of light, the phase shift will become more significant, leading to a more complex interference pattern.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of the resulting interference pattern will still be the vector sum of the amplitudes of the two waves, but the phase shift will be affected by the Doppler effect and will depend on the observer's velocity. As the observer's velocity approaches the speed of light, the phase shift will become more significant, leading to a more complex interference pattern."
