    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop of wire with radius R carrying a current I, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the wire, r is the vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a circular loop, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law over the entire loop. At the center of the loop, the magnetic field due to each current element is in the same direction (perpendicular to the plane of the loop). Therefore, we can simplify the integration as follows:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dl / R^2)\n\nThe integral of dl over the entire loop is equal to the circumference of the loop, which is 2πR. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * (2πR / R^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we find the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop of wire with radius R carrying a current I, expressed in terms of I, R, and the fundamental constant μ₀ (the permeability of free space)."
