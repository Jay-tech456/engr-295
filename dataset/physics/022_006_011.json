    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and the overall structure and evolution of galaxies. Although dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible to telescopes, it interacts gravitationally with normal matter (also known as baryonic matter), which includes stars, gas, and dust.\n\nThe impact of dark matter on galaxy formation can be summarized in the following points:\n\n1. Gravitational pull: Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational pull to initiate the process of galaxy formation. It forms a massive, invisible halo around the visible part of the galaxy, which helps to hold the galaxy together and prevent it from dispersing.\n\n2. Cosmic web: Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, a large-scale structure of the universe consisting of interconnected filaments of dark matter and gas. This cosmic web serves as the scaffolding for the formation of galaxies, as baryonic matter is attracted to the dense regions of dark matter.\n\n3. Galaxy clusters: Dark matter is responsible for the formation of galaxy clusters, which are large groups of galaxies bound together by gravity. The presence of dark matter in these clusters is inferred from the gravitational lensing effect it has on the light from distant galaxies.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter and normal matter affects the overall structure and evolution of galaxies in several ways:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: The presence of dark matter in galaxies explains the observed galaxy rotation curves, which show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move at similar speeds as those in the inner regions. This is contrary to what would be expected if only the visible matter contributed to the gravitational pull. The additional mass provided by dark matter helps to explain this phenomenon.\n\n2. Galaxy mergers: Dark matter plays a role in galaxy mergers, which are important events in the evolution of galaxies. During a merger, the dark matter halos of the colliding galaxies interact with each other, affecting the distribution of stars and gas in the resulting galaxy.\n\n3. Star formation: The interaction between dark matter and normal matter can influence the rate of star formation in galaxies. The gravitational pull of dark matter can compress gas clouds, leading to the formation of new stars. However, the presence of dark matter can also heat up the gas, making it less likely to collapse and form stars.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter has a significant impact on galaxy formation and the overall structure and evolution of galaxies. Its gravitational influence helps to initiate galaxy formation, maintain the stability of galaxies, and shape the large-scale structure of the universe. The interaction between dark matter and normal matter also plays a role in various processes, such as galaxy rotation curves, galaxy mergers, and star formation."
