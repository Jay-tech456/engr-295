    "message_2": "The manipulation of external magnetic fields can significantly impact the motion and behavior of magnetic domain walls and skyrmions in thin-film ferromagnetic materials. Both domain walls and skyrmions are topological defects in the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials, and their dynamics are crucial for the development of novel magnetic storage and spintronic devices.\n\n1. Magnetic domain walls: Magnetic domain walls are boundaries separating regions with different magnetization directions in a ferromagnetic material. The application of an external magnetic field can cause the domain walls to move, which is known as domain wall motion. This motion can be described by the following factors:\n\n   a. Zeeman energy: The external magnetic field interacts with the magnetic moments in the domain wall, causing a change in the Zeeman energy. This energy change drives the domain wall to move in the direction of the applied field.\n\n   b. Spin-transfer torque: When a spin-polarized current is applied to the ferromagnetic material, the transfer of angular momentum from the conduction electrons to the local magnetic moments can exert a torque on the domain wall, causing it to move.\n\n   c. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI): In materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, the DMI can stabilize chiral domain walls and influence their motion under an external magnetic field. The DMI can cause the domain wall to move in a direction perpendicular to the applied field.\n\n2. Skyrmions: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale vortex-like spin textures that can be stabilized in thin-film ferromagnetic materials due to the interplay between exchange, DMI, and dipolar interactions. The manipulation of external magnetic fields can affect skyrmions in the following ways:\n\n   a. Creation and annihilation: An external magnetic field can create or annihilate skyrmions by changing the balance between the competing magnetic interactions. A critical magnetic field is required to nucleate or destroy skyrmions.\n\n   b. Skyrmion motion: The application of an external magnetic field or a spin-polarized current can drive skyrmions to move. The motion of skyrmions is influenced by the Magnus force, which causes them to move perpendicularly to the applied force. This unique motion, known as the skyrmion Hall effect, can be tuned by manipulating the external magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, the manipulation of external magnetic fields plays a crucial role in controlling the motion and behavior of magnetic domain walls and skyrmions in thin-film ferromagnetic materials. Understanding these effects is essential for the development of advanced magnetic storage and spintronic devices."
