    "message_2": "The Hagen-Poiseuille equation describes the relationship between blood viscosity (η), vessel radius (r), and blood flow rate (Q) in the cardiovascular system. The equation is as follows:\n\nQ = (π * ΔP * r^4) / (8 * η * L)\n\nWhere:\nQ = blood flow rate (volume per unit time, e.g., mL/s)\nΔP = pressure difference between the two ends of the vessel (Pa)\nr = vessel radius (m)\nη = blood viscosity (Pa·s)\nL = length of the vessel (m)\nπ = pi (approximately 3.14159)\n\nAccording to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, the blood flow rate (Q) is directly proportional to the pressure difference (ΔP) and the fourth power of the vessel radius (r^4), and inversely proportional to the blood viscosity (η) and the length of the vessel (L). This means that if the vessel radius increases, the blood flow rate will increase significantly, and if the blood viscosity increases, the blood flow rate will decrease."
