    "message_2": "To calculate the cross section for the nuclear reaction between nitrogen-14 and alpha particles at an incident energy of 2.5 MeV, we need to know the specific reaction taking place and have access to experimental data or a theoretical model that describes the cross section as a function of energy.\n\nOne possible reaction between nitrogen-14 and alpha particles is the formation of oxygen-17 and a proton, represented as:\n\nN-14(α,p)O-17\n\nThe cross section for this reaction, σ(E), depends on the incident energy E and can be determined from experimental data or theoretical models. Unfortunately, without access to specific experimental data or a model for this reaction, we cannot provide an exact value for the cross section at 2.5 MeV.\n\nHowever, you can refer to published research articles, databases, or nuclear reaction models to find the cross section for this specific reaction at the given energy. Some resources to consider include the EXFOR database (https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/exfor.htm) and the TALYS code (http://www.talys.eu/)."
