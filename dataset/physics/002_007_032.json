    "message_1": "What is the heat capacity of a silver metal sample with a mass of 25 g if 100 J of heat energy is required to raise its temperature from 20°C to 40°C? (Assuming no phase change occurs during heating and the specific heat capacity of silver is 0.24 J/g°C.)",
    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the silver metal sample, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy (in joules), m is the mass of the sample (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of the material (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\nq = 100 J\nm = 25 g\nc = 0.24 J/g°C\nΔT = 40°C - 20°C = 20°C\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n100 J = (25 g)(0.24 J/g°C)(20°C)\n\nTo find the heat capacity, we can divide both sides of the equation by the mass (25 g) and the change in temperature (20°C):\n\nHeat capacity = 100 J / (25 g × 20°C) = 100 J / 500 g°C = 0.20 J/°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the silver metal sample is 0.20 J/°C."
