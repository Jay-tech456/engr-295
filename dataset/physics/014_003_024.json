    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K). The CMB is the residual thermal radiation from the early universe, which has cooled and expanded over time. It provides evidence for the Big Bang theory because its existence and properties are consistent with the predictions of the theory.\n\nThe Big Bang theory posits that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. As the universe expanded, the radiation within it also cooled and stretched, eventually forming the CMB we observe today. The CMB's nearly uniform temperature and its blackbody radiation spectrum are strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.\n\nTo calculate the wavelength corresponding to the peak intensity of the CMB radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere λ_max is the wavelength of peak intensity, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature of the CMB (2.725 K).\n\nλ_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / (2.725 K) ≈ 1.063 x 10^-3 m\n\nThe wavelength corresponding to the peak intensity of the CMB radiation is approximately 1.063 x 10^-3 meters, or 1.063 millimeters.\n\nThis wavelength is significant in the context of the early universe because it provides information about the conditions at the time when the CMB was formed. The CMB's peak wavelength corresponds to the time when the universe had cooled enough for atoms to form, allowing photons to travel freely without being scattered by charged particles. This process, known as recombination, occurred roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The CMB's peak wavelength and temperature give us insight into the state of the universe at that time and help us understand its evolution from the initial hot, dense state to the current cooler, expanding state."
