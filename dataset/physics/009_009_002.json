    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image from the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = +10 cm and u = -20 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention). Now, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying all terms by 20v to eliminate the fractions:\n\n2v = -v + 20v\n\nNow, solving for v:\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSo, the image will be formed at a distance of 20 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (m) of the image, we can use the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nm = -20/(-20)\n\nm = 1\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object."
