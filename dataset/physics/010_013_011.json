    "message_1": "A student is asked to design an airfoil for a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The airfoil needs to generate enough lift to keep the UAV aloft but must also resist flow separation and stall at the desired operating conditions. Determine the ideal camber and thickness distributions of the airfoil to achieve these desired results.",
    "message_2": "To design an airfoil that generates enough lift and resists flow separation and stall, we need to consider the camber and thickness distributions. The camber line is the curve that is equidistant between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil, and it affects the lift and pitching moment characteristics. The thickness distribution affects the drag and structural properties of the airfoil.\n\n1. Camber distribution:\nFor a small UAV, a moderate camber is desirable to generate sufficient lift at low speeds. A camber of around 2-4% of the chord length is a good starting point. The maximum camber should be located around 30-40% of the chord length from the leading edge. This will provide a good lift-to-drag ratio and help delay flow separation.\n\n2. Thickness distribution:\nA thickness-to-chord ratio (t/c) of around 12-15% is suitable for small UAVs. This provides a balance between structural strength and aerodynamic efficiency. The maximum thickness should be located around 30-40% of the chord length from the leading edge, similar to the camber location.\n\nTo design the airfoil, you can use existing airfoil families as a starting point and modify them to meet the desired camber and thickness distributions. Some popular airfoil families for small UAVs are the NACA 4-digit series, Clark-Y, and Eppler airfoils. You can use airfoil design software like XFOIL or JavaFoil to analyze and optimize the airfoil performance.\n\nOnce you have designed the airfoil, it is essential to validate its performance through wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This will help you ensure that the airfoil meets the desired lift, drag, and stall characteristics for the UAV's operating conditions."
