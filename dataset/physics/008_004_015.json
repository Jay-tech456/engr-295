    "message_2": "As of September 2021, the current most precise experimental measurement of the mass of the top quark in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is 172.22 ± 0.07 (stat) ± 0.65 (syst) GeV/c². This result was obtained by the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) collaboration in 2019. The uncertainty associated with this measurement is 0.07 GeV/c² from statistical uncertainty and 0.65 GeV/c² from systematic uncertainty. Please note that these values may be updated as new experimental results become available."
