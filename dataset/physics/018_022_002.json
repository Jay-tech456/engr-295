    "message_2": "The weak interaction in the beta decay of a free neutron is characterized by the Fermi coupling constant (G_F), which is a measure of the strength of the weak force. The precision measurement of the weak interaction in beta decay is determined through various experimental methods, such as studying the neutron lifetime and decay correlations.\n\nThe current precision value of the Fermi coupling constant (G_F) is approximately 1.1663787 x 10^(-5) GeV^(-2) with an uncertainty of ±0.0000006 x 10^(-5) GeV^(-2). This value is obtained from the muon decay experiment, which is related to the beta decay of a free neutron through the conserved vector current hypothesis.\n\nIn the beta decay of a free neutron, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an electron antineutrino. The decay rate (Γ) of this process can be expressed in terms of the Fermi coupling constant (G_F), the neutron lifetime (τ_n), and other factors such as phase space and radiative corrections. The neutron lifetime is currently measured to be approximately 880.2 ± 1.0 seconds.\n\nBy combining the experimental data from neutron lifetime measurements and decay correlations, the precision measurement of the weak interaction in the beta decay of a free neutron can be determined. However, it is essential to note that ongoing research and improvements in experimental techniques may lead to even more precise measurements in the future."
