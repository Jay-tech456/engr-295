    "message_2": "The nature of the interaction between dark matter and normal matter is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be primarily gravitational. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light, radio waves, or X-rays). However, dark matter is thought to make up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe, and its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on the motion of visible matter, such as stars and galaxies.\n\nThere are several lines of evidence that suggest the existence of dark matter. One of the most compelling is the observation of galaxy rotation curves, which show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than can be accounted for by the visible mass of stars and gas. This suggests that there is additional, unseen mass in the form of dark matter that is influencing the motion of these galaxies.\n\nAnother piece of evidence comes from the observation of gravitational lensing, where the path of light from distant galaxies is bent by the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters. The amount of lensing observed is greater than can be accounted for by the visible mass of these objects, again suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\nThere are several experimental approaches to detect dark matter directly or indirectly. These include:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to observe the interaction of dark matter particles with normal matter in highly sensitive detectors. Examples of such experiments include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS). These experiments typically look for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are one of the leading dark matter candidates.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay. For example, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observes high-energy gamma rays that could be produced by dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way and other galaxies.\n\n3. Collider experiments: Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in high-energy collisions. By studying the products of these collisions, physicists can search for signs of dark matter production.\n\n4. Cosmological observations: Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure of the universe, and the distribution of galaxy clusters can provide constraints on the properties of dark matter and help to refine theoretical models.\n\nDespite these experimental efforts, dark matter has not yet been directly detected, and its true nature remains a mystery. Further research and advancements in experimental techniques are needed to shed light on the interaction between dark matter and normal matter and to ultimately unravel the nature of this elusive substance."
