    "message_1": "A circular loop of radius 10 cm carries a steady current of 2 A. Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m (converting 10 cm to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 4π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.26 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since the current is flowing in a circular loop, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop. If the current is flowing clockwise, the magnetic field will be pointing downwards, and if the current is flowing counterclockwise, the magnetic field will be pointing upwards."
