    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis. In this case, we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, so x = 0.\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R²)^(3/2))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converting to meters)\nI = 2 A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.05 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * 0.0025 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.0025 m²) / (0.0025 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.0025 m²) / (0.0025 m²)\n\nB = 8π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 2.51 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 2.51 × 10^(-6) T."
