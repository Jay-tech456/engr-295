    "message_2": "The band structure of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) can be determined by its chirality, which is defined by a pair of integers (n, m). For a zigzag carbon nanotube, the chiral vector is given by (n, 0), where n is an integer. However, the question mentions an armchair edge, which is a bit contradictory since armchair and zigzag are two different types of nanotubes. Assuming you meant a zigzag carbon nanotube, I will proceed with that.\n\nThe diameter (d) of a zigzag SWCNT can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nd = (n * a_cc) / π\n\nwhere a_cc is the carbon-carbon bond length, approximately 1.42 Å.\n\nThe band structure of a zigzag SWCNT can be determined using the tight-binding approximation. The energy dispersion relation for the π and σ bands near the Fermi energy can be described by:\n\nE(k) = ±γ0 * |cos(ka_cc/2)|\n\nwhere E(k) is the energy as a function of the wave vector k, γ0 is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy (approximately 2.7 eV), and a_cc is the carbon-carbon bond length.\n\nFor a zigzag SWCNT, the energy dispersion relation shows that the π bands cross at the Fermi energy, resulting in a metallic behavior. The σ bands, on the other hand, are far from the Fermi energy and do not contribute significantly to the electronic properties.\n\nSymmetry-related features in the band structure arise from the hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms in the nanotube. The π bands exhibit a linear dispersion near the Fermi energy, which is a consequence of the honeycomb lattice symmetry. The σ bands, being related to the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms, are less affected by the lattice symmetry and have a parabolic dispersion.\n\nIn summary, the band structure of a zigzag SWCNT is determined by its chirality and diameter. The energy dispersion of the π and σ bands near the Fermi energy exhibits linear and parabolic behavior, respectively, with the π bands crossing at the Fermi energy, leading to metallic behavior. The symmetry-related features in the band structure arise from the hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms in the nanotube."
