    "message_1": "What is the efficiency of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) used for nuclear energy production, considering that its thermal power output is 3,000 MW and its electrical power output is 1,000 MW? Use the formula for thermal efficiency: efficiency = electrical power output / thermal power output.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the pressurized water reactor (PWR), we can use the given formula:\n\nEfficiency = Electrical Power Output / Thermal Power Output\n\nGiven the electrical power output is 1,000 MW and the thermal power output is 3,000 MW, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1,000 MW / 3,000 MW\n\nEfficiency = 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nTo express the efficiency as a percentage, we can multiply the result by 100:\n\nEfficiency = 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) is approximately 33.33%."
