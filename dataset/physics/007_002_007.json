    "message_2": "To calculate the activity of the sample after 12 days, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the half-life of radium-226 from years to seconds and the time elapsed from days to seconds.\n\n1 year = 365.25 days (accounting for leap years)\n1 day = 24 hours\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\nHalf-life in seconds:\n1602 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute ≈ 5.058e+10 seconds\n\nTime elapsed in seconds:\n12 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 1,036,800 seconds\n\nNow we can plug these values into the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = 10,000 disintegrations/second * (1/2)^(1,036,800 seconds / 5.058e+10 seconds)\n\nActivity_final ≈ 10,000 disintegrations/second * (1/2)^0.0205\nActivity_final ≈ 10,000 disintegrations/second * 0.9803\nActivity_final ≈ 9,803 disintegrations/second\n\nThe activity of the radium-226 sample after 12 days is approximately 9,803 disintegrations per second."
