When a current of 5 A flows through the coil, the coil experiences a torque of 0.025 Nm. Calculate the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the plane of the coil.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the plane of the coil, we can use the formula for torque experienced by a current-carrying loop in a magnetic field:\n\nTorque (τ) = n * I * A * B * sin(θ)\n\nwhere:\nn = number of turns in the coil (assuming 1 turn for this problem)\nI = current in the coil (5 A)\nA = area of the coil (length * width = 0.2 m * 0.1 m = 0.02 m²)\nB = magnetic field strength perpendicular to the plane of the coil\nθ = angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plane of the coil\n\nSince the torque experienced by the coil is 0.025 Nm, we can rearrange the formula to solve for B:\n\nB = τ / (n * I * A * sin(θ))\n\nWe know that the total magnetic field strength is 1 T, but we need to find the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. To do this, we can use the sine of the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plane of the coil:\n\nsin(θ) = B_perpendicular / B_total\n\nRearranging this formula, we get:\n\nB_perpendicular = B_total * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for B_perpendicular into the torque formula:\n\nτ = n * I * A * (B_total * sin(θ)) * sin(θ)\n\n0.025 Nm = 1 * 5 A * 0.02 m² * (1 T * sin(θ)) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for sin(θ):\n\n0.025 Nm = 0.1 A*m² * sin(θ)^2\n\nsin(θ)^2 = 0.025 / 0.1\nsin(θ)^2 = 0.25\nsin(θ) = ±0.5\n\nSince sin(θ) can only be between -1 and 1, the only possible value for sin(θ) is 0.5. Now we can find the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the plane of the coil:\n\nB_perpendicular = B_total * sin(θ)\nB_perpendicular = 1 T * 0.5\nB_perpendicular = 0.5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the plane of the coil is 0.5 T."
