    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop is rectangular, we can simplify the problem by finding the magnetic field due to each side of the rectangle and then summing up the contributions.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as follows:\n- Side A: 0.5 meters (horizontal)\n- Side B: 0.3 meters (vertical)\n\nThe magnetic field at the center due to each side can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire to the center of the loop.\n\nFor the horizontal sides (A), the distance r is half of the vertical side length (0.15 meters). For the vertical sides (B), the distance r is half of the horizontal side length (0.25 meters).\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field due to each side:\n\n1. Horizontal sides (A):\nB_A = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.15 m) = (5 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.15 = 3.33 × 10^(-6) T\n\n2. Vertical sides (B):\nB_B = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.25 m) = (5 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.25 = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nNow, we need to find the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each side. Since the magnetic field due to the horizontal sides is perpendicular to the magnetic field due to the vertical sides, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the total magnetic field:\n\nB_total = √(B_A^2 + B_B^2) = √((3.33 × 10^(-6) T)^2 + (2 × 10^(-6) T)^2) ≈ 3.94 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be found using the tangent of the angle between the horizontal and vertical components:\n\ntan(θ) = B_B / B_A = (2 × 10^(-6) T) / (3.33 × 10^(-6) T) ≈ 0.6\n\nθ = arctan(0.6) ≈ 30.96°\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is approximately 30.96° counterclockwise from the horizontal component.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is approximately 3.94 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is approximately 30.96° counterclockwise from the horizontal component."
