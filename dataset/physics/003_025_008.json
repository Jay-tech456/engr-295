    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field generated at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the resistor, we need to use the Biot-Savart law. However, the Biot-Savart law is applicable for a current-carrying wire, not a resistor. So, we will assume that the resistor is a straight wire for the sake of this problem.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field (dB) generated by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying current (I) at a point located at a distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nFor a straight wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance (d) from the center of the wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2.5 A and the distance (d) is 10 cm (0.1 m), we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.1\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field generated at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the resistor is 2.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
