    "message_2": "To find the ground state energy of an electron confined in a spherical quantum dot, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a particle in a 3D spherical box (also known as a spherical quantum dot):\n\nE_n = (h^2 * n^2) / (8 * m * R^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, h is the reduced Planck's constant (h = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js), n is the principal quantum number, m is the mass of the electron (m = 9.10938356 × 10^(-31) kg), and R is the radius of the spherical quantum dot.\n\nGiven the diameter of the quantum dot is 20 nm, the radius (R) is 10 nm, or 10 × 10^(-9) m.\n\nFor the ground state energy, we consider the lowest energy level, which corresponds to n = 1.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nE_1 = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 * (1^2) / (8 * 9.10938356 × 10^(-31) kg * (10 × 10^(-9) m)^2)\n\nE_1 = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34))^2 / (8 * 9.10938356 × 10^(-31) * 10^(-18))\n\nE_1 ≈ 1.6102 × 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, the ground state energy of an electron confined in a spherical quantum dot of diameter 20 nm with an infinite confinement potential is approximately 1.6102 × 10^(-19) Joules."
