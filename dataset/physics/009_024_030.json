    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the transmitted light, we can use Malus's Law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is equal to the intensity of the incident light (I_i) multiplied by the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer (θ).\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(θ)\n\nIn this case, the intensity of the incident light (I_i) is 50.0 W/m^2, and the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer (θ) is 45 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_t = 50.0 W/m^2 * cos^2(π/4)\nI_t = 50.0 W/m^2 * (1/√2)^2\nI_t = 50.0 W/m^2 * 1/2\n\nI_t = 25.0 W/m^2\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted light is 25.0 W/m^2."
