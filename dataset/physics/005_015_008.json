    "message_2": "To calculate the proton's relativistic energy, we first need to find its relativistic mass. The relativistic mass (m) is given by the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass of the proton, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light. The rest mass of a proton is approximately m0 = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and its velocity is given as 0.9c.\n\nFirst, let's find the factor in the denominator:\n\n1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.19) ≈ 3.83 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic energy (E) using the equation:\n\nE = m * c^2\n\nE ≈ (3.83 x 10^-27 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 3.44 x 10^-10 J\n\nNow, let's find the rest energy (E0) of the proton:\n\nE0 = m0 * c^2\n\nE0 = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 1.50 x 10^-10 J\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the proton's relativistic energy to its rest energy:\n\nRatio = E / E0\n\nRatio ≈ (3.44 x 10^-10 J) / (1.50 x 10^-10 J) ≈ 2.29\n\nSo, the ratio of the proton's relativistic energy to its rest energy is approximately 2.29."
