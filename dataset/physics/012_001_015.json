    "message_1": "Calculate the confinement time of a plasma in a tokamak fusion reactor having a magnetic field strength of 5 tesla and a plasma density of 10^20 particles/m^3. The temperature of the plasma is 100 million degrees Celsius and its energy confinement time is 5 seconds.",
    "message_2": "The confinement time of a plasma in a tokamak fusion reactor is given by the energy confinement time, which is a measure of how long it takes for the plasma to lose its energy. In this problem, the energy confinement time is given as 5 seconds. Therefore, the confinement time of the plasma in this tokamak fusion reactor is 5 seconds."
