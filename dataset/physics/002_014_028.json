    "message_1": "A refrigerator operates with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0. If the refrigerator requires 3 kW of work to remove 12 kJ of heat energy from its contents, what is the amount of heat removed from the contents and the amount of heat rejected to the environment?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) is given by the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nwhere Q_c is the amount of heat removed from the contents, and W is the work input. We are given the COP as 4.0 and the work input as 3 kW.\n\nFirst, let's convert the work input to kJ:\n\n3 kW * 1 hour/3600 seconds = 3 kJ/s\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_c:\n\n4.0 = Q_c / (3 kJ/s)\nQ_c = 4.0 * (3 kJ/s)\nQ_c = 12 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of heat removed from the contents is 12 kJ.\n\nNext, we need to find the amount of heat rejected to the environment, Q_h. We can use the energy conservation equation:\n\nQ_h = Q_c + W\n\nWe already know Q_c (12 kJ) and W (3 kJ/s):\n\nQ_h = 12 kJ + (3 kJ/s * 1 s)\nQ_h = 12 kJ + 3 kJ\nQ_h = 15 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of heat rejected to the environment is 15 kJ."
