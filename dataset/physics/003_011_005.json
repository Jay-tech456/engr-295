    "message_1": "A disc of radius 0.05 meters carries a current of 3 amperes uniformly distributed across its surface. Calculate the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.15 meters from the center of the disc along its axis, assuming the disc is infinitely thin.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located at a distance z from the center of the disc along its axis, we can use the formula derived from Biot-Savart Law for a current-carrying disc:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (z² + R²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and z is the distance from the center of the disc along its axis.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 3 A\nR = 0.05 m\nz = 0.15 m\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.15 m² + 0.05 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (6π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0225 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (15π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.025 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (15π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * 0.003125 m³)\nB ≈ 1.51 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.15 meters from the center of the disc along its axis is approximately 1.51 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
