    "message_2": "To find the observed angle of the star due to relativistic aberration of light, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nθ' = arctan[(sin(θ) / (γ(1 + βcos(θ))]\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the observed angle,\nθ is the angle of the star relative to the spaceship's direction (60 degrees),\nβ is the ratio of the spaceship's speed to the speed of light (0.8),\nγ is the Lorentz factor, which is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.8^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nθ' = arctan[(sin(60°) / (1.667(1 + 0.8cos(60°)))]\n\nθ' = arctan[(sin(60°) / (1.667(1 + 0.8(0.5)))]\n\nθ' = arctan[(0.866 / (1.667(1.4))]\n\nθ' = arctan[(0.866 / 2.3338)]\n\nθ' = arctan[0.371]\n\nθ' ≈ 20.5°\n\nSo, the observed angle of the star due to relativistic aberration of light is approximately 20.5 degrees."
