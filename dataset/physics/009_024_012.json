    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem:\n\nA beam of unpolarized light with an intensity of 10 W/m² is incident on a polarizer at an angle of 45°. What is the intensity of the transmitted light?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the transmitted light, we can use Malus's Law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is equal to the initial intensity (I_i) multiplied by the square of the cosine of the angle between the plane of polarization and the plane of transmission (θ).\n\nI_t = I_i * cos²(θ)\n\nIn this case, the initial intensity (I_i) is 10 W/m², and the angle (θ) is 45°. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 45° * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Malus's Law:\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * cos²(π/4)\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * (1/√2)²\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * 1/2\n\nI_t = 5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted light is 5 W/m²."
