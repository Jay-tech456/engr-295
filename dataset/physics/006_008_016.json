    "message_1": "A physics student wants to calculate the photoelectric effect in a rubidium atom. The atom has an ionization energy of 4.18 eV and the incoming photon has an energy of 5.25 eV. Determine the kinetic energy of the emitted electron and the wavelength of the absorbed photon.",
    "message_2": "To determine the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, we can use the following equation for the photoelectric effect:\n\nKE = E_photon - E_ionization\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, E_photon is the energy of the incoming photon, and E_ionization is the ionization energy of the rubidium atom.\n\nGiven:\nE_ionization = 4.18 eV\nE_photon = 5.25 eV\n\nCalculating the kinetic energy:\nKE = 5.25 eV - 4.18 eV\nKE = 1.07 eV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the emitted electron is 1.07 eV.\n\nNow, let's determine the wavelength of the absorbed photon. We can use the following equation to relate the energy of the photon to its wavelength:\n\nE_photon = (h * c) / λ\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = (h * c) / E_photon\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy of the photon from eV to Joules. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.\n\nE_photon = 5.25 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nE_photon = 8.4105 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / 8.4105 x 10^-19 J\nλ = 2.362 x 10^-7 m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers (nm), we can convert meters to nanometers by multiplying by 10^9:\n\nλ = 2.362 x 10^-7 m * 10^9 nm/m\nλ = 236.2 nm\n\nThe wavelength of the absorbed photon is 236.2 nm."
