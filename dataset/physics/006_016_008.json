    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nMagnetic moment (μ) = Gyromagnetic ratio (γ) * Angular momentum (L) * Magnetic field (B)\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the angular momentum (L) is given by the formula:\n\nL = ħ * (l + 1/2)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) and l is the orbital quantum number. For the ground state of hydrogen, l = 0.\n\nL = ħ * (0 + 1/2) = ħ * 1/2\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = γ * L * B\n\nμ = (2.675 × 10^8 rad/T.s) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js * 1/2) * (2.0 T)\n\nμ = (2.675 × 10^8) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 * 0.5) * 2.0\n\nμ = 2.822 × 10^-26 J/T\n\nThe magnetic moment of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 2.0 Tesla is approximately 2.822 × 10^-26 Joules per Tesla."
