    "message_2": "Brewster's law states that the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection, is given by the following equation:\n\ntan(θ_B) = n₂ / n₁\n\nwhere θ_B is the Brewster's angle, n₁ is the index of refraction of the first medium (air, in this case, with n₁ ≈ 1), and n₂ is the index of refraction of the second medium (glass, in this case, with n₂ = 1.5).\n\nTo find the Brewster's angle, we can use the inverse tangent function:\n\nθ_B = arctan(n₂ / n₁) = arctan(1.5 / 1) = arctan(1.5)\n\nθ_B ≈ 56.31°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence of a light beam that is polarized by reflection from a glass surface with an index of refraction of 1.5 according to Brewster's law is approximately 56.31°."
