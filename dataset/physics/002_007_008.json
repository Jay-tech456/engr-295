    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of aluminum, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius).\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nQ = 50 J\nm = 500 g\nΔT = 10°C\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 50 J / (500 g × 10°C)\n\nc = 50 J / 5000 g°C\n\nc = 0.01 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of aluminum is 0.01 J/g°C."
