    "message_1": "A cylinder of radius 5 cm carries a current of 2 A, and has a length of 30 cm. What is the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the axis of the cylinder? Assume the permeability of free space to be 4π × 10^-7 T m/A.",
    "message_2": "We can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the axis of the cylinder. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, we need to find the current enclosed by a loop of radius 10 cm. Since the cylinder has a radius of 5 cm, the loop of radius 10 cm will enclose the entire current of the cylinder.\n\nI_enclosed = 2 A\n\nNow, let's consider a circular loop of radius 10 cm centered on the axis of the cylinder. The magnetic field at every point on this loop will have the same magnitude (B) and will be tangent to the loop. Therefore, the dot product B⋅dl will simply be B*dl at every point on the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = B∮dl = B * (circumference of the loop)\n\nThe circumference of the loop is given by:\n\nC = 2πr = 2π(0.1 m) = 0.2π m\n\nSo, ∮B⋅dl = B * 0.2π m\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field:\n\nB * 0.2π m = μ₀ * 2 A\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2 A) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T m/A * 2 A) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^-7 T m) / (0.2π m)\n\nB ≈ 4 × 10^-6 T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the axis of the cylinder is approximately 4 × 10^-6 T."
