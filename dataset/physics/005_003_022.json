    "message_2": "To determine the velocity of the second spaceship relative to planet Earth, we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.9c (in the x-direction) and v2 = 0.8c (in the y-direction). We need to find the magnitudes and directions of the velocities in the x and y components.\n\nFor the x-component, we have:\n\nvx = (0.9c + 0) / (1 + (0.9c * 0) / c^2) = 0.9c\n\nFor the y-component, we have:\n\nvy = (0 + 0.8c) / (1 + (0 * 0.8c) / c^2) = 0.8c\n\nNow we have the x and y components of the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth. To find the magnitude of the total velocity, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nv = sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2) = sqrt((0.9c)^2 + (0.8c)^2) = sqrt(0.81c^2 + 0.64c^2) = sqrt(1.45c^2) = c * sqrt(1.45)\n\nv ≈ 1.204c\n\nHowever, this result is not physically possible, as nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This discrepancy arises because we did not take into account the relativistic effects when adding the velocities. We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nFor the x-component, we have:\n\nvx = 0.9c (since there is no x-component in the second spaceship's velocity)\n\nFor the y-component, we have:\n\nvy = (0.8c) / (1 + (0.9c * 0.8c) / c^2) ≈ 0.695c\n\nNow we have the x and y components of the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth. To find the magnitude of the total velocity, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nv = sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2) = sqrt((0.9c)^2 + (0.695c)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.81c^2 + 0.483c^2) ≈ sqrt(1.293c^2) = c * sqrt(1.293)\n\nv ≈ 1.137c\n\nAgain, this result is not physically possible. The discrepancy arises because we have not correctly applied the relativistic velocity addition formula to both the x and y components simultaneously. The correct approach is to use the Lorentz transformation to combine the velocities.\n\nLet's denote the first spaceship's velocity as (0.9c, 0) and the second spaceship's velocity as (0, 0.8c). We can use the Lorentz transformation to find the second spaceship's velocity relative to Earth:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2) ≈ 2.294\n\nThe transformed velocity components are:\n\nvx' = (vx + 0) / (1 + (0.9c * 0) / c^2) = 0.9c\n\nvy' = (0 + γ * 0.8c) / (1 + (0.9c * 0.8c) / c^2) ≈ 1.835c / 2.52 ≈ 0.728c\n\nNow we have the x and y components of the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth. To find the magnitude of the total velocity, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nv = sqrt(vx'^2 + vy'^2) = sqrt((0.9c)^2 + (0.728c)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.81c^2 + 0.53c^2) ≈ sqrt(1.34c^2) = c * sqrt(1.34)\n\nv ≈ 1.157c\n\nThis result is still not physically possible. The correct approach is to use the Lorentz transformation to combine the velocities in a four-vector form, which takes into account both the spatial and temporal components of the velocities.\n\nLet's denote the first spaceship's four-velocity as (γ1, γ1 * 0.9c, 0, 0) and the second spaceship's four-velocity as (γ2, 0, γ2 * 0.8c, 0), where γ1 and γ2 are the Lorentz factors for the first and second spaceships, respectively:\n\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2) ≈ 2.294\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2) ≈ 1.667\n\nNow we can use the Lorentz transformation to find the second spaceship's four-velocity relative to Earth:\n\nU = (γ1 * γ2, γ1 * γ2 * 0.9c, γ1 * γ2 * 0.8c, 0) ≈ (3.823, 3.441, 3.068, 0)\n\nThe magnitude of the total velocity is given by the ratio of the spatial components to the temporal component:\n\nv = sqrt((3.441c)^2 + (3.068c)^2) / 3.823 ≈ 1.157c / 3.823 ≈ 0.303c\n\nSo the velocity of the second spaceship relative to planet Earth is approximately 0.303c."
