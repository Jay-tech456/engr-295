    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture using the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the critical properties and acentric factor of ethanol.\n2. Calculate the PR EOS parameters: a, b, alpha, A, and B.\n3. Solve the PR EOS cubic equation for the compressibility factor (Z).\n4. Calculate the fugacity coefficient (phi) for ethanol.\n5. Calculate the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture.\n\nStep 1: Critical properties and acentric factor of ethanol\nEthanol (C2H5OH) has the following critical properties and acentric factor:\nTc = 513.9 K (critical temperature)\nPc = 61.37 bar (critical pressure)\nω = 0.643 (acentric factor)\n\nStep 2: PR EOS parameters\nFirst, we need to convert the given temperature and pressure to Kelvin and bar:\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nP = 1 bar\n\nNow, we can calculate the PR EOS parameters:\na = 0.45724 * (R^2 * Tc^2) / Pc\nb = 0.07780 * R * Tc / Pc\nalpha = (1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 * ω - 0.26992 * ω^2) * (1 - sqrt(T / Tc)))^2\nA = alpha * a * P / (R * T)^2\nB = b * P / (R * T)\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant, R = 0.08314 L*bar/(mol*K).\n\nStep 3: Solve the PR EOS cubic equation for Z\nThe PR EOS cubic equation is given by:\nZ^3 - (1 - B) * Z^2 + (A - 3 * B^2 - 2 * B) * Z - (AB - B^2 - B^3) = 0\n\nWe need to solve this equation for Z. There can be up to three real roots, but we are interested in the root that represents the liquid phase. The liquid phase root is the smallest real root.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the fugacity coefficient (phi) for ethanol\nOnce we have the compressibility factor (Z), we can calculate the fugacity coefficient (phi) for ethanol using the following equation:\n\nphi_ethanol = exp[(b / (R * T)) * (Z - 1) - log(Z - B) - (A / (2 * sqrt(2) * B)) * log((Z + (1 + sqrt(2)) * B) / (Z + (1 - sqrt(2)) * B))]\n\nStep 5: Calculate the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture using the mole fraction (x) and the fugacity coefficient (phi):\n\nfugacity_ethanol = x_ethanol * phi_ethanol * P\n\nwhere x_ethanol = 0.4 (mole fraction of ethanol in the mixture).\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we will obtain the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture using the Peng-Robinson equation of state."
