    "message_2": "To determine the minimum mass of Uranium-235 required to sustain a chain reaction, we need to find the critical mass. The critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. For Uranium-235, the critical mass depends on the shape, density, and purity of the material, as well as the presence of a neutron reflector.\n\nIn a typical nuclear reactor, the critical mass of Uranium-235 is around 15 kg (33 lbs) for a sphere with a diameter of about 17 cm (6.7 inches) under normal conditions. However, this value can vary depending on the specific design and configuration of the reactor.\n\nIt is important to note that the 200 MeV of energy released per fission event does not directly affect the critical mass. The critical mass is determined by the ability of the fissile material to sustain a chain reaction, which depends on the probability of neutron capture and the number of neutrons produced per fission event. The energy released per fission event is a separate consideration when designing a reactor to produce a specific amount of power."
