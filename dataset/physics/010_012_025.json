Determine the boundary layer thickness at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge. Additionally, calculate the average shear stress developed in the fluid at that point. Assume the fluid viscosity to be 0.01 Pa.s and the density to be 1000 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To determine the boundary layer thickness at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers, which is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^(1/2)\n\nwhere δ is the boundary layer thickness, x is the distance from the leading edge (0.5 m in this case), ν is the kinematic viscosity, and U is the free-stream velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν). We can do this by dividing the dynamic viscosity (μ) by the fluid density (ρ):\n\nν = μ / ρ\nν = 0.01 Pa.s / 1000 kg/m³\nν = 1 x 10^(-5) m²/s\n\nNow we can calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.5 * (1 x 10^(-5) / 2))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ 0.005 m\n\nThe boundary layer thickness at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge is approximately 0.005 meters or 5 mm.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the average shear stress developed in the fluid at that point. We can use the following formula for shear stress (τ) in a laminar boundary layer:\n\nτ = μ * (dU / dy)\n\nwhere dU/dy is the velocity gradient at the edge of the boundary layer. Since we know the boundary layer thickness (δ) and the free-stream velocity (U), we can approximate the velocity gradient as:\n\ndU / dy ≈ U / δ\n\nNow we can calculate the shear stress:\n\nτ = 0.01 Pa.s * (2 m/s / 0.005 m)\nτ ≈ 4 Pa\n\nThe average shear stress developed in the fluid at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge is approximately 4 Pa."
