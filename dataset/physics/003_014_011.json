    "message_1": "A rectangular loop with width 0.2 cm and length 0.5 cm is carrying a current of 2 A. What is the magnetic field at the center of the loop? Consider the loop to be lying in the y-z plane with the bottom edge at y = -0.1 cm and the top edge at y = 0.1 cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and then multiply it by 2 to account for the other side. Let's consider the top edge of the loop (y = 0.1 cm) and find the magnetic field at the center due to this edge.\n\nThe position vector r from the top edge to the center of the loop is:\n\nr = -0.1 cm in the y-direction\n\nThe differential length vector dl for the top edge is:\n\ndl = 0.5 cm in the z-direction\n\nThe cross product dl x r is:\n\ndl x r = (0.5 cm) x (-0.1 cm) in the x-direction = -0.05 cm² in the x-direction\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\ndB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * -0.05 cm²) / (0.1 cm)³\ndB = (10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (-0.1 A cm²) / 0.001 cm³\ndB = -0.1 × 10⁻⁴ T in the x-direction\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, the magnetic field due to the bottom edge will also be in the x-direction and have the same magnitude. Therefore, the total magnetic field at the center of the loop is:\n\nB = 2 * dB = 2 * (-0.1 × 10⁻⁴ T) = -0.2 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is -0.2 × 10⁻⁴ T in the x-direction."
