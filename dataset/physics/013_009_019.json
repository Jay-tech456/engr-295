    "message_2": "Magnetic fields play a crucial role in the process of star formation in the interstellar medium. They influence various stages of star formation and affect the properties of newly formed stars in several ways:\n\n1. Support against gravitational collapse: Magnetic fields provide support to the interstellar medium against gravitational collapse. They help in maintaining the balance between the gravitational forces that pull the gas and dust together and the magnetic pressure that pushes them apart. This balance is essential for the initial stages of star formation.\n\n2. Regulation of angular momentum: As the interstellar medium collapses under gravity, it begins to rotate, and the conservation of angular momentum causes it to spin faster. Magnetic fields help in transferring angular momentum from the inner regions of the collapsing cloud to the outer regions, allowing the central region to collapse further and form a protostar.\n\n3. Formation of accretion disks: Magnetic fields play a vital role in the formation of accretion disks around protostars. The interaction between the magnetic field and the rotating gas and dust causes the material to flatten into a disk-like structure. This accretion disk is where most of the mass of the forming star is accumulated and where planets may eventually form.\n\n4. Driving outflows and jets: Magnetic fields are responsible for driving powerful outflows and jets from the protostar. These outflows help in removing excess angular momentum and mass from the system, allowing the protostar to continue collapsing and eventually form a stable star.\n\n5. Influence on stellar properties: The strength and orientation of the magnetic field can influence the properties of newly formed stars, such as their mass, rotation rate, and magnetic activity. For example, stars with stronger magnetic fields may have slower rotation rates and higher levels of magnetic activity, which can affect their long-term evolution and the properties of their planetary systems.\n\nIn summary, magnetic fields play a critical role in the process of star formation in the interstellar medium. They provide support against gravitational collapse, regulate angular momentum, contribute to the formation of accretion disks, drive outflows and jets, and influence the properties of newly formed stars. Understanding the role of magnetic fields in star formation is essential for gaining insights into the formation and evolution of stars and their planetary systems."
