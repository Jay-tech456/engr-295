    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric describes a charged black hole and is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r²)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, Q is the charge of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nThe horizon radius (r_h) can be found by solving the equation:\n\n1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r² = 0\n\nWe are given the values of M and Q, so we can plug them in and solve for r:\n\n1 - 2G(2x10^30 kg)/c²r + G(5 C)²/c⁴r² = 0\n\nUsing the values G = 6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² and c = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s, we can solve for r:\n\n1 - 2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(2x10^30 kg)/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)²r + (6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5 C)²/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)⁴r² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in r, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (2GM/c² ± √((2GM/c²)² - 4GQ²/c⁴))/(2GQ²/c⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nr = (2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(2x10^30 kg)/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)² ± √(((2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(2x10^30 kg)/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)²)² - 4(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5 C)²/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)⁴))/(2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5 C)²/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)⁴)\n\nSolving for r, we get two solutions: r1 ≈ 5.972 x 10^3 m and r2 ≈ 1.194 x 10^4 m. These are the inner and outer horizon radii, respectively.\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface gravity (κ) using the formula:\n\nκ = c²/(2r_h) * d/dr(1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r²)\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to r and plugging in the values, we get:\n\nκ = c²/(2r_h) * (2GM/c²r² - 2GQ²/c⁴r³)\n\nFor the outer horizon (r2 ≈ 1.194 x 10^4 m), we can plug in the values and calculate the surface gravity:\n\nκ = (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)²/(2(1.194 x 10^4 m)) * ((2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(2x10^30 kg)/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)²(1.194 x 10^4 m)²) - (2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5 C)²/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)⁴(1.194 x 10^4 m)³))\n\nSolving for κ, we get κ ≈ 2.51 x 10^12 m/s².\n\nSo, the horizon radius for the charged black hole is approximately 1.194 x 10^4 m, and the surface gravity is approximately 2.51 x 10^12 m/s²."
