    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves that a spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter can withstand before being pulled out of its orbit, we need to consider the balance between the gravitational force exerted by Jupiter and the perturbation caused by the gravitational waves.\n\nLet's denote the mass of Jupiter as M_J, the mass of the spacecraft as m, the distance between the spacecraft and the center of Jupiter as r, and the amplitude of the gravitational wave as h. The gravitational force between Jupiter and the spacecraft is given by:\n\nF_gravity = G * M_J * m / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe perturbation caused by the gravitational wave can be estimated by considering the tidal force exerted on the spacecraft. The tidal force is given by:\n\nF_tidal = m * r * h * f^2\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational wave.\n\nFor the spacecraft to remain in orbit, the gravitational force must be greater than or equal to the tidal force:\n\nF_gravity >= F_tidal\n\nSubstituting the expressions for F_gravity and F_tidal, we get:\n\nG * M_J * m / r^2 >= m * r * h * f^2\n\nWe can rearrange this inequality to solve for the maximum amplitude h:\n\nh <= (G * M_J) / (r^3 * f^2)\n\nTo calculate the maximum amplitude, we need to know the specific values for the distance r and the frequency f of the gravitational wave. The distance r depends on the altitude of the spacecraft's orbit, and the frequency f depends on the source of the gravitational wave. Without these values, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the maximum amplitude.\n\nHowever, the formula above provides a general expression for the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves that a spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter can withstand before being pulled out of its orbit."
