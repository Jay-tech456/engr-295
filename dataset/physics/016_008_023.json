    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of superconducting thin films made of Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) is typically around 90 Kelvin (-183 degrees Celsius). YBCO is a high-temperature superconductor, which means it has a higher Tc compared to other superconducting materials.\n\nThe critical temperature of YBCO thin films can be affected by the thickness of the film. Generally, as the thickness of the film decreases, the critical temperature can also decrease. This is due to factors such as defects, strain, and interface effects that can influence the superconducting properties of the material. However, the relationship between the film thickness and critical temperature is not always straightforward and can depend on the specific fabrication process and conditions.\n\nIn some cases, researchers have observed an increase in Tc with decreasing film thickness, while in other cases, Tc remains relatively constant or decreases. The variation in Tc with film thickness is an area of ongoing research, and the exact relationship can depend on factors such as the quality of the film, the substrate used, and the deposition method."
