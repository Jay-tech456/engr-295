    "message_2": "The rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy is a plot that shows the orbital velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of their distance from the galactic center. In a simple model, based on Newtonian gravity and the visible mass distribution, we would expect the velocities to increase with distance from the center up to a certain point and then decrease as we move further out, following a Keplerian decline.\n\nHowever, observations of the Milky Way and other galaxies show that the rotation curves remain relatively flat or even slightly increase at large distances from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected ones based on visible mass led to the hypothesis of dark matter, an unseen form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible to telescopes.\n\nDark matter is believed to be distributed in a roughly spherical halo surrounding the galaxy, extending far beyond the visible stars and gas. Its presence and distribution can be inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of stars and gas in the galaxy. The flat rotation curves observed in the Milky Way and other galaxies suggest that dark matter constitutes a significant fraction of the total mass in the universe, with current estimates indicating that it makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy is an important piece of evidence for the existence and distribution of dark matter. The observed flat rotation curve indicates that there is a significant amount of unseen mass, likely in the form of dark matter, distributed in a halo around the galaxy, which affects the motion of stars and gas within the galaxy."
