    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of a monolayer graphene sheet, we can use the formula for conductivity (σ) in terms of carrier concentration (n), charge of an electron (e), and electron mobility (μ):\n\nσ = n * e * μ\n\nFirst, we need to find the electron mobility (μ) for graphene. The electron mobility in graphene is typically in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 cm^2/Vs at room temperature. For this problem, let's assume an average value of 50,000 cm^2/Vs.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nn = 10^12 cm^-2 (given)\ne = 1.6 × 10^-19 C (charge of an electron)\nμ = 50,000 cm^2/Vs (assumed for graphene at room temperature)\n\nσ = (10^12 cm^-2) * (1.6 × 10^-19 C) * (50,000 cm^2/Vs)\n\nσ ≈ 8 × 10^4 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of a monolayer graphene sheet with a carrier concentration of 10^12 cm^-2 at room temperature assuming diffusive transport is approximately 8 × 10^4 S/m."
