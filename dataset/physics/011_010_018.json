    "message_2": "The dielectric constant (also known as relative permittivity) of a sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal at room temperature is approximately 5.9. This value is relatively constant at low frequencies. However, as the frequency increases, the dielectric constant may change due to various factors such as polarization and lattice vibrations.\n\nIn the case of NaCl, the dielectric constant remains relatively constant up to frequencies in the range of 10^12 Hz (terahertz). Beyond this frequency range, the dielectric constant starts to decrease due to the inability of the ions in the crystal lattice to respond to the rapidly changing electric field. This decrease continues until the dielectric constant approaches the value of 1 at very high frequencies (in the range of ultraviolet or higher).\n\nIn summary, the dielectric constant of a sodium chloride crystal at room temperature is approximately 5.9 and remains relatively constant at low frequencies. As the frequency increases, the dielectric constant decreases, approaching a value of 1 at very high frequencies."
