    "message_2": "The maximum frequency of gravitational waves that can be detected by ground-based observatories like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is around 10 kHz (10,000 Hz). This upper limit is determined by the noise levels in the detectors and the design of the interferometer arms.\n\nAstrophysical sources that could potentially produce gravitational waves at or near this frequency include:\n\n1. Compact binary systems: These are systems where two compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, orbit each other closely. As they spiral inwards, they emit gravitational waves. The frequency of these waves increases as the objects get closer, reaching the maximum detectable frequency just before they merge.\n\n2. Supernovae: The core-collapse of massive stars can lead to the formation of neutron stars or black holes. The asymmetric collapse and subsequent explosion can produce gravitational waves with frequencies in the detectable range for ground-based observatories.\n\n3. Rotating neutron stars: Neutron stars with irregular shapes or \"mountains\" on their surfaces can emit continuous gravitational waves as they rotate. The frequency of these waves depends on the rotation rate of the neutron star, which can be in the range of ground-based observatories.\n\n4. Cosmic string cusps: Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional defects in spacetime that could have formed during the early universe. The cusps, or sharp kinks, on these strings can emit gravitational waves with frequencies in the detectable range for ground-based observatories.\n\nIt is important to note that the sensitivity of ground-based observatories like LIGO and Virgo is not uniform across the entire frequency range. They are most sensitive to frequencies between 100 Hz and 1 kHz, which is where most of the detected gravitational wave events have occurred so far."
