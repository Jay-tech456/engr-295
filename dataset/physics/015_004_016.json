    "message_1": "What is the approximate total energy emitted in gravitational waves from a supernova explosion, assuming a distance of 10 kpc from Earth? (use the equation E = (G/5c⁴) * (Mv)², where G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, M is the mass of the star, and v is the speed of the ejected matter).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the approximate total energy emitted in gravitational waves from a supernova explosion, we need to know the mass of the star (M) and the speed of the ejected matter (v). However, these values are not provided in the problem statement. \n\nAssuming typical values for a supernova explosion, we can use M = 1.4 solar masses (which is approximately 2.8 x 10^30 kg) and v = 10^4 km/s (which is approximately 10^7 m/s). \n\nNow, we can use the given equation E = (G/5c⁴) * (Mv)²:\n\nG (gravitational constant) = 6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\nc (speed of light) = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 / (5 * (3 x 10^8)⁴)) * ((2.8 x 10^30) * (10^7))²\n\nE ≈ 2.6 x 10^46 J (joules)\n\nSo, the approximate total energy emitted in gravitational waves from a supernova explosion at a distance of 10 kpc from Earth is 2.6 x 10^46 joules. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, as the actual values for mass and speed of ejected matter can vary significantly depending on the specific supernova."
