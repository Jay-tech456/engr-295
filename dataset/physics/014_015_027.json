    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy of cosmic rays and their penetration depth in the Earth's atmosphere can be described by the following factors:\n\n1. Energy of cosmic rays: Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. Their energies can range from millions to trillions of electron volts (eV). The higher the energy of a cosmic ray, the deeper it can penetrate into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2. Penetration depth: The penetration depth of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere depends on their energy and the density of the atmosphere. As cosmic rays travel through the atmosphere, they interact with atmospheric molecules, losing energy and producing secondary particles. The higher the energy of a cosmic ray, the more likely it is to penetrate deeper into the atmosphere before losing all its energy.\n\n3. Ionization of atmospheric gases: As cosmic rays interact with atmospheric molecules, they can ionize the molecules, creating charged particles (ions and electrons). The ionization rate depends on the energy of the cosmic rays and the density of the atmosphere. Higher-energy cosmic rays can ionize more molecules, leading to a higher ionization rate.\n\n4. Formation of secondary particles: The interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric molecules can also produce secondary particles, such as muons, neutrons, and pions. These secondary particles can further interact with other atmospheric molecules, creating even more secondary particles and ionization. The production of secondary particles depends on the energy of the primary cosmic rays, with higher-energy cosmic rays producing more secondary particles.\n\nIn summary, the energy of cosmic rays is directly related to their penetration depth in the Earth's atmosphere. Higher-energy cosmic rays can penetrate deeper into the atmosphere, leading to increased ionization of atmospheric gases and the formation of secondary particles. These processes can have various effects on the Earth's atmosphere, including the production of clouds, the generation of atmospheric electric fields, and the influence on the Earth's climate."
