    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time measured by the observer on Earth (also known as the dilated time), Δt is the time measured by the spaceship (the proper time), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n\nΔt = 50 days (we'll convert this to seconds later)\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can find the value of the denominator in the time dilation equation:\n\n√(1 - v^2/c^2) = √(1 - 0.64) = √(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNext, we need to convert 50 days to seconds:\n\n50 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 4,320,000 seconds\n\nNow we can find the dilated time Δt':\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2) = 4,320,000 seconds / 0.6 ≈ 7,200,000 seconds\n\nFinally, let's convert the dilated time back to days:\n\n7,200,000 seconds * (1 minute / 60 seconds) * (1 hour / 60 minutes) * (1 day / 24 hours) ≈ 83.33 days\n\nSo, the observer on Earth will measure the elapsed time to be approximately 83.33 days."
