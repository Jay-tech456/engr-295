    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a disc with a given radius and current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and x is the distance from the center of the disc to the point where we want to find the magnetic field. In this case, we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the disc, so x = 0.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.2 m)²) / (2 * (0.2 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.04 m²) / (2 * 0.04 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.04 m²) / (2 * 0.04 m²)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A)\n\nB ≈ 1.25663706 × 10^(-6) T * 5\n\nB ≈ 6.2831853 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the disc is approximately 6.28 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
