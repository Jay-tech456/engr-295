    "message_1": "What would be the distance between the central maximum and the first-order maximum in the interference pattern produced by a double-slit when the distance between them is 0.1mm and the wavelength of the light is 500nm?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central maximum and the first-order maximum in the interference pattern produced by a double-slit, we can use the formula for the angular position of the maxima in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the maximum, m is the order of the maximum (1 for the first-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nIn this case, λ = 500 nm (5 x 10^-7 m) and d = 0.1 mm (1 x 10^-4 m). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nθ = (1 * 5 x 10^-7 m) / (1 x 10^-4 m) = 5 x 10^-3 radians\n\nNow, we need to find the actual distance between the central maximum and the first-order maximum on the screen. To do this, we can use the small-angle approximation formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the first-order maximum, L is the distance between the double-slit and the screen, and θ is the angular position of the maximum.\n\nHowever, the distance L between the double-slit and the screen is not provided in the problem. To find the distance y, we need to know the value of L. If you provide the value of L, I can calculate the distance y for you."
