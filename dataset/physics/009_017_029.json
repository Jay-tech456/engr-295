    "message_1": "A physics student aims to measure the width of a single slit using the single slit diffraction pattern produced by a laser of wavelength 700 nm. The student observes that the first minimum of the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of 30 degrees. What is the width of the single slit?",
    "message_2": "To find the width of the single slit, we can use the formula for the angular position of the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nWe are given the angle θ = 30 degrees, the wavelength λ = 700 nm, and we want to find the width a. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula and solve for a:\n\nsin(π / 6) = (1 * 700 nm) / a\n\na = (1 * 700 nm) / sin(π / 6)\n\na ≈ 700 nm / 0.5\n\na ≈ 1400 nm\n\nSo, the width of the single slit is approximately 1400 nm."
