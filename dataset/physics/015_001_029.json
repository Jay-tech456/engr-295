    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * f^2) / (c^4 * r * d)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM1 = mass of the first black hole (10 solar masses)\nM2 = mass of the second black hole (15 solar masses)\nf = frequency of the orbit (50 Hz)\nc = speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\nr = distance between the black holes\nd = distance from the observer to the system (1 megaparsec)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes and the distance to the observer into SI units (kilograms and meters, respectively).\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n1 parsec = 3.086 x 10^16 m\n1 megaparsec = 10^6 parsecs\n\nM1 = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 15 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.984 x 10^31 kg\nd = 1 * 10^6 * 3.086 x 10^16 m = 3.086 x 10^22 m\n\nTo find the distance between the black holes (r), we can use the formula for the orbital period of a binary system:\n\nT = 2 * pi * sqrt(r^3 / (G * (M1 + M2)))\n\nSince we know the frequency (f), we can find the orbital period (T) as:\n\nT = 1 / f = 1 / 50 Hz = 0.02 s\n\nNow we can solve for r:\n\nr^3 = (G * (M1 + M2) * T^2) / (4 * pi^2)\nr = ((G * (M1 + M2) * T^2) / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3)\n\nr = ((6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 2.984 x 10^31 kg) * (0.02 s)^2) / (4 * (3.14159)^2))^(1/3)\nr ≈ 1.191 x 10^7 m\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves (h):\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * f^2) / (c^4 * r * d)\nh = (4 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) * (2.984 x 10^31 kg) * (50 Hz)^2) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^4 * (1.191 x 10^7 m) * (3.086 x 10^22 m))\nh ≈ 1.33 x 10^-22\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system is approximately 1.33 x 10^-22."
