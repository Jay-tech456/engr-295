Calculate the new internal energy of the block when its temperature reaches 100°C, assuming no change in volume or pressure. The specific heat capacity of iron is 0.45 J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the iron block from 20°C to 100°C. We can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat added, m is the mass of the iron block, c is the specific heat capacity of iron, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 1 kg = 1000 g (since 1 kg = 1000 g)\nc = 0.45 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 20°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 100°C\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 100°C - 20°C = 80°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat added:\n\nQ = (1000 g)(0.45 J/g°C)(80°C) = 36000 J\n\nThe initial internal energy of the block increased by 500 J, so the new internal energy will be:\n\nNew internal energy = Initial internal energy + Heat added\nNew internal energy = 500 J + 36000 J = 36500 J\n\nSo, the new internal energy of the block when its temperature reaches 100°C is 36,500 J."
