    "message_2": "To calculate the isothermal work done during the expansion of an ideal gas, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 1.5 moles\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (ideal gas constant)\nT = 273 K\nVi = 2 L\nVf = 5 L\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volumes from liters to cubic meters:\n\n1 L = 0.001 m³\n\nVi = 2 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.002 m³\nVf = 5 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.005 m³\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nW = -1.5 * 8.314 * 273 * ln(0.005 / 0.002)\nW = -1.5 * 8.314 * 273 * ln(2.5)\nW ≈ -5474.91 J\n\nThe isothermal work done during the expansion of the ideal gas is approximately -5474.91 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas on its surroundings (expansion)."
