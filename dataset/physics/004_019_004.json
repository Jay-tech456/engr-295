    "message_1": "A spaceship that travels at a speed of 0.6c experiences time dilation due to its velocity. If the spaceship travels for 10 years according to its own clock, how much time would have passed on Earth according to the time dilation effect of General Relativity?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect, we can use the time dilation formula from Special Relativity:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time interval observed on Earth (the time we want to find),\nΔt0 is the time interval observed on the spaceship (10 years),\nv is the velocity of the spaceship (0.6c),\nc is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔt = 10 years / √(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt = 10 years / √(1 - 0.36)\n\nΔt = 10 years / √(0.64)\n\nΔt = 10 years / 0.8\n\nΔt ≈ 12.5 years\n\nSo, approximately 12.5 years would have passed on Earth while the spaceship experienced 10 years of travel time."
