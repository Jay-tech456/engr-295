    "message_2": "The average dose of cosmic ray background radiation that an astronaut would be exposed to during a round-trip journey to Mars depends on several factors, such as the duration of the mission, the shielding of the spacecraft, and the solar activity. However, a rough estimate can be made based on previous studies and measurements.\n\nA round-trip journey to Mars, including the time spent on the Martian surface, would take approximately 2-3 years. During this time, an astronaut would be exposed to cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originating from outside the solar system. The primary source of cosmic rays is galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), which consist mostly of protons, helium nuclei, and high-energy electrons.\n\nAccording to a study by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), the average dose rate of GCRs in deep space is about 0.5 millisieverts (mSv) per day. Over the course of a 2-3 year mission, this would result in a total dose of approximately 365-547.5 mSv.\n\nIn addition to GCRs, astronauts would also be exposed to solar particle events (SPEs), which are sporadic bursts of high-energy particles emitted by the Sun. The dose from SPEs is highly variable and depends on the solar activity and the shielding of the spacecraft. However, it is estimated that the dose from SPEs could add up to 100 mSv or more during a Mars mission.\n\nConsidering both GCRs and SPEs, the total dose of cosmic ray background radiation for an astronaut during a round-trip journey to Mars could be in the range of 465-647.5 mSv or more.\n\nThe dose limit for radiation exposure set by regulatory agencies varies depending on the organization and the type of mission. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has set a career dose limit for astronauts of 1000 mSv for low-Earth orbit missions. The European Space Agency (ESA) has set a dose limit of 500 mSv per year for its astronauts. The dose received during a Mars mission would be a significant fraction of these limits and could potentially exceed the annual limit set by the ESA.\n\nIn conclusion, the average dose of cosmic ray background radiation during a round-trip journey to Mars is substantial and poses a significant health risk to astronauts. This risk needs to be carefully considered and mitigated through shielding and other protective measures in the design of future Mars missions."
