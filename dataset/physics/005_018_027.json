    "message_2": "To determine the relativistic wave equation for a particle of rest mass m moving with velocity v in one dimension, we start with the Klein-Gordon equation, which is a relativistic wave equation that describes particles with non-zero mass:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (mc/ħ)²)ψ = 0\n\nSince we are considering a one-dimensional case, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∂²/∂x² + (mc/ħ)²)ψ = 0\n\nThis is the relativistic wave equation for a particle of rest mass m moving with velocity v in one dimension.\n\nNow, let's calculate the wavelength of the de Broglie wave associated with the particle if its kinetic energy is given by K. The de Broglie wavelength (λ) is related to the momentum (p) of the particle by the equation:\n\nλ = h/p\n\nFor a relativistic particle, we need to use the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = mv/√(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe kinetic energy (K) of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWe can solve for v²/c² from the kinetic energy equation:\n\nv²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² = (γ² - 1)/γ²\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression into the momentum formula:\n\np = mvc/√((γ² - 1)/γ²) = mvc/√(1 - 1/γ²) = γmv\n\nNow, we can substitute the momentum expression into the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h/(γmv)\n\nThis is the wavelength of the de Broglie wave associated with the particle if its kinetic energy is given by K."
