    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconducting wire made of YBa2Cu3O7, also known as Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), is approximately 92 Kelvin (-181°C or -294°F). This material is a high-temperature superconductor, meaning it has a relatively high critical temperature compared to other superconducting materials.\n\nThe critical temperature can be affected by external factors such as magnetic field and electric current flowing through the wire. Here's how they influence the critical temperature:\n\n1. Magnetic field: As the external magnetic field increases, the critical temperature of the superconductor decreases. This is because the magnetic field can penetrate the superconducting material and disrupt the Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconducting state. This effect is described by the upper critical field (Hc2), which is the maximum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand while maintaining its superconducting state. For YBCO, the upper critical field is quite high, making it suitable for applications involving strong magnetic fields.\n\n2. Electric current: The critical current (Ic) is the maximum current that can flow through a superconductor without causing any resistive losses. When the current flowing through the wire exceeds the critical current, the superconducting state is destroyed, and the material becomes resistive. This effect is due to the motion of vortices within the superconductor, which can cause energy dissipation and resistive losses. In general, the critical current decreases as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, and it also decreases with increasing magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature of a YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting wire is approximately 92 K, and it can be affected by changes in magnetic field and electric current. Higher magnetic fields and currents can decrease the critical temperature, leading to the loss of superconductivity."
