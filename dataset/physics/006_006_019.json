    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine splitting energy levels in the atomic spectra of hydrogen and deuterium, we need to consider the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the magnetic field produced by the electron. This interaction is described by the hyperfine Hamiltonian, which is given by:\n\nH_hf = A S ⋅ I\n\nwhere A is the hyperfine coupling constant, S is the electron spin operator, and I is the nuclear spin operator. The hyperfine coupling constant A depends on the wavefunction of the electron and the nuclear magnetic moment.\n\nFor hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D), the nuclear spin quantum numbers are different. Hydrogen has a proton with a nuclear spin quantum number I_H = 1/2, while deuterium has a neutron and a proton with a nuclear spin quantum number I_D = 1. The electron spin quantum number is S = 1/2 for both.\n\nThe energy levels for the hyperfine splitting can be calculated using the quantum numbers F, which is the total angular momentum quantum number, given by F = I + S. For hydrogen, F can take values of F_H = 0 or 1, while for deuterium, F can take values of F_D = 1/2, 3/2.\n\nThe hyperfine splitting energy levels can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_hf = A/2 * [F(F+1) - I(I+1) - S(S+1)]\n\nFor hydrogen, we can calculate the energy levels for F_H = 0 and F_H = 1. For deuterium, we can calculate the energy levels for F_D = 1/2 and F_D = 3/2.\n\nTo compare the hyperfine splitting energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium, we can calculate the energy differences between the levels for each isotope:\n\nΔE_H = E_hf(F_H = 1) - E_hf(F_H = 0)\nΔE_D = E_hf(F_D = 3/2) - E_hf(F_D = 1/2)\n\nBy comparing these energy differences, we can analyze the differences in the hyperfine splitting energy levels between hydrogen and deuterium. Note that the hyperfine coupling constant A will be different for hydrogen and deuterium due to the differences in their nuclear magnetic moments and wavefunctions."
