    "message_1": "An electron of rest mass $m_0$ and kinetic energy $K$ travels with a speed of 0.8c, where c is the speed of light. Another electron of the same mass is at rest relative to the first electron. Find the de Broglie wavelength of each electron and determine whether they interfere. If they interfere, calculate the phase difference between the waves at the point where they first interfere.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the relativistic mass of the moving electron. The relativistic mass $m$ is given by the formula:\n\n$m = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass, $v$ is the velocity of the electron, and $c$ is the speed of light. In this case, $v = 0.8c$, so:\n\n$m = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.64}} = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{0.36}} = \\frac{m_0}{0.6}$\n\nNow, let's find the de Broglie wavelength of the moving electron. The de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$\n\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the electron. The momentum of the electron is given by:\n\n$p = mv$\n\nSo, for the moving electron:\n\n$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{h}{\\frac{m_0}{0.6} \\cdot 0.8c} = \\frac{h}{0.8c \\cdot \\frac{m_0}{0.6}} = \\frac{0.6h}{0.8c \\cdot m_0}$\n\nFor the electron at rest, its momentum is zero, and its de Broglie wavelength is infinite. Therefore, the de Broglie wavelengths of the two electrons are:\n\n$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{0.6h}{0.8c \\cdot m_0}$\n\n$\\lambda_2 = \\infty$\n\nSince the de Broglie wavelength of the second electron is infinite, the two electrons will not interfere. The concept of interference is not applicable in this case, as the second electron's wavefunction is essentially constant in space."
