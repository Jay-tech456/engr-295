    "message_2": "The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. Its mass is an important parameter that helps us understand the properties of the Higgs boson and the stability of the electroweak vacuum. There are several experimental techniques used to measure the mass of the top quark, and they account for uncertainties in different ways. Some of the most common techniques include:\n\n1. Template Method: In this method, the mass of the top quark is determined by comparing the distributions of kinematic observables in the data to simulated templates for different top quark masses. The templates are generated using Monte Carlo simulations, which take into account various sources of uncertainties, such as detector resolution, parton distribution functions, and background contributions. The uncertainties are propagated through the analysis and are included in the final measurement.\n\n2. Matrix Element Method: This method uses the full event information and calculates the probability of an event being a top quark-antiquark pair production based on the matrix elements of the underlying scattering process. The mass of the top quark is determined by maximizing the likelihood function, which is built from these probabilities. Uncertainties are accounted for by varying the input parameters, such as the renormalization and factorization scales, and by considering different parton distribution functions.\n\n3. Ideogram Method: This method is similar to the matrix element method but uses a different approach to build the likelihood function. It combines the probabilities of individual events to form an ideogram, which is then used to extract the top quark mass. The uncertainties are accounted for in a similar way as in the matrix element method.\n\n4. Jet Energy Scale (JES) Method: In this method, the mass of the top quark is determined by calibrating the energy scale of the jets produced in the event. The calibration is performed using well-known processes, such as the production of Z bosons or photon+jets events. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale are propagated through the analysis and are included in the final measurement.\n\nThese experimental techniques are applied to data collected by particle detectors, such as the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The combination of these methods allows for a more precise determination of the top quark mass and helps to reduce the overall uncertainties. The current world-average value of the top quark mass, which includes results from the LHC and the Tevatron experiments, is around 173.1 Â± 0.9 GeV/c^2."
