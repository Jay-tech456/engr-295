    "message_2": "Gravitinos are hypothetical particles predicted by supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. They are the supersymmetric partners of gravitons, the particles that mediate the gravitational force. If gravitinos exist and make up the dark matter in the universe, their mass range can be estimated based on current theoretical models and experimental constraints.\n\nThe mass of gravitinos depends on the scale of supersymmetry breaking, which is not well-constrained by current experiments. However, various theoretical models and experimental constraints can provide some guidance on the possible mass range of gravitinos.\n\nIn the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models, gravitino masses can be as light as a few eV (electron volts) up to several keV (kilo-electron volts). In these models, gravitinos are often considered as warm dark matter candidates.\n\nIn gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking (mSUGRA) models, the gravitino mass can range from a few GeV (giga-electron volts) to several TeV (tera-electron volts). In these scenarios, gravitinos are typically considered as cold dark matter candidates.\n\nIt is important to note that these mass ranges are subject to change as new experimental data and theoretical developments become available. Direct detection of gravitinos or evidence for supersymmetry in collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), could help refine these mass ranges and provide further insight into the nature of dark matter."
