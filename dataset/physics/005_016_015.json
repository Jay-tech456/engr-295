    "message_1": "A particle of mass 5 kg moves towards a stationary target particle of mass 2 kg with a speed of 0.8c. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, what is the speed and direction of each particle after the collision, and what is the angle between their final directions of motion?",
    "message_2": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's denote the initial mass of the moving particle as m1 (5 kg) and its initial velocity as v1 (0.8c), and the mass of the stationary particle as m2 (2 kg) and its initial velocity as v2 (0). After the collision, the particles will have velocities v1' and v2', respectively.\n\nFirst, let's conserve momentum:\nm1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = m1 * v1' + m2 * v2'\n5 * 0.8c = 5 * v1' + 2 * v2'\n\nNext, let's conserve kinetic energy:\n(1/2) * m1 * v1^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2^2 = (1/2) * m1 * v1'^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2'^2\n(1/2) * 5 * (0.8c)^2 = (1/2) * 5 * v1'^2 + (1/2) * 2 * v2'^2\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns (v1' and v2'). We can solve these equations to find the velocities of the particles after the collision.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the momentum equation:\n4c = 5 * v1' + 2 * v2'\n\nNow, let's simplify the kinetic energy equation:\n(1/2) * 5 * (0.64c^2) = (1/2) * 5 * v1'^2 + (1/2) * 2 * v2'^2\n1.6c^2 = 5 * v1'^2 + 2 * v2'^2\n\nNow, we can solve these equations using substitution or any other method. The solutions are:\nv1' ≈ 0.2667c\nv2' ≈ 1.8667c\n\nThe moving particle (5 kg) will have a final velocity of approximately 0.2667c, and the stationary particle (2 kg) will have a final velocity of approximately 1.8667c.\n\nTo find the angle between their final directions of motion, we can use the formula for the angle between two vectors:\ncos(theta) = (v1' * v2') / (|v1'| * |v2'|)\n\nSince both particles are moving in the same direction after the collision, the angle between their final directions of motion is 0 degrees."
