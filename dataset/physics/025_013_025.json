    "message_2": "The wavelength of light plays a crucial role in the perception of color in the human eye. The human eye contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain to create visual images. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and visual acuity in bright light conditions.\n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the human eye, each sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths of light. These cones are classified as short-wavelength (S-cones), medium-wavelength (M-cones), and long-wavelength (L-cones) cones. S-cones are most sensitive to blue light (around 420-440 nm), M-cones are most sensitive to green light (around 530-540 nm), and L-cones are most sensitive to red light (around 560-580 nm).\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the lens, and the vitreous humor before reaching the retina, where the photoreceptors are located. The cones absorb the light and convert it into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals and interprets them as colors based on the specific combination of cone cells that are activated.\n\nThe perception of color in the human eye is determined by the wavelength of light that is absorbed by the cone cells. Shorter wavelengths correspond to blue colors, while longer wavelengths correspond to red colors. The range of visible light for humans is approximately 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Colors in between, such as green, yellow, and orange, are perceived when a combination of cone cells are activated by different wavelengths of light.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light affects the perception of color in the human eye by activating specific cone cells that are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths. The brain then interprets the combination of activated cone cells as a specific color."
