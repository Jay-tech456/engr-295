    "message_2": "To determine the expected frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the merging of two primordial black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2), and M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes in solar masses.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, M1 = 10 solar masses = 1.989 x 10^31 kg and M2 = 20 solar masses = 3.978 x 10^31 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 3.978 x 10^31 kg))\nf ≈ 1.18 x 10^-2 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the merging of these two black holes is approximately 0.0118 Hz. However, this is the frequency at the source. Due to the expansion of the universe, the frequency observed on Earth will be redshifted. To account for this, we need to find the redshift (z) for a distance of 1 billion light years.\n\nUsing the Hubble constant (H0) of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc and the distance of 1 billion light years (approximately 306.4 Mpc), we can estimate the redshift using the formula:\n\nz = (H0 * d) / c\n\nwhere d is the distance in Mpc.\n\nz ≈ (70 km/s/Mpc * 306.4 Mpc) / (3 x 10^5 km/s)\nz ≈ 0.72\n\nNow, we can find the observed frequency on Earth using the formula:\n\nf_observed = f / (1 + z)\n\nf_observed ≈ 0.0118 Hz / (1 + 0.72)\nf_observed ≈ 0.00686 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the merging of two primordial black holes with masses of 10 and 20 solar masses, at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth, is approximately 0.00686 Hz."
