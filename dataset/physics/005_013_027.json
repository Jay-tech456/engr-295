    "message_2": "Let's denote the moving particle as particle A and the particle at rest as particle B. The rest mass of each particle is 1.5 GeV/c². We are given that the total energy of the system after the collision is 5 GeV. We need to find the speed of particle A before the collision.\n\nFirst, let's recall the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nFor particle A, let's denote its energy before the collision as E_A, its momentum as p_A, and its speed as v_A. For particle B, since it's at rest, its energy before the collision is equal to its rest mass energy, E_B = 1.5 GeV, and its momentum is zero.\n\nThe total energy of the system before the collision is E_A + E_B. After the collision, the total energy is 5 GeV. Therefore, we have:\n\nE_A + 1.5 GeV = 5 GeV\nE_A = 3.5 GeV\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum equation for particle A:\n\n(3.5 GeV)² = (1.5 GeV/c² * c²)² + (p_A * c)²\n\nWe can also express the momentum p_A in terms of the mass and speed of particle A using the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np_A = m * v_A / sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)²)\n\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum equation, we get:\n\n(3.5 GeV)² = (1.5 GeV/c² * c²)² + (1.5 GeV/c² * v_A * c / sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)²))^2\n\nSimplifying and solving for v_A/c, we get:\n\n(3.5/1.5)^2 = 1 + (v_A/c)^2 / (1 - (v_A/c)^2)\n\nLet x = v_A/c, then:\n\n(3.5/1.5)^2 = 1 + x^2 / (1 - x^2)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^2 = (1 - x^2) * (3.5/1.5)^2 - 1\nx^2 = (1 - x^2) * (49/9)\n\nRearranging and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 * (1 + 49/9) = 49/9\nx^2 = (49/9) / (58/9)\nx^2 = 49/58\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nx = v_A/c = sqrt(49/58) ≈ 0.912\n\nThus, the speed of particle A before the collision is approximately 0.912c. Since particle B is at rest, its speed before the collision is 0."
