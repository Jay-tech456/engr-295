    "message_1": "Sure, here is a problem for you to solve: \n\nA microscope produces a magnified image of an object that is 10 mm in height. When viewed through the eyepiece, the image appears to be 4.8 mm in height. What is the magnification of the microscope?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the microscope, we can use the formula:\n\nMagnification = (Height of the magnified image) / (Height of the original object)\n\nIn this case, the height of the magnified image is 4.8 mm, and the height of the original object is 10 mm.\n\nMagnification = (4.8 mm) / (10 mm) = 0.48\n\nThe magnification of the microscope is 0.48."
