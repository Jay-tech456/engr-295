    "message_2": "Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force acting on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force can be calculated as the difference between the weight of the iron in air and the weight of the iron when submerged in water.\n\nBuoyant force = Weight in air - Weight in water\nBuoyant force = 4.5 N - 3.6 N\nBuoyant force = 0.9 N\n\nNow, we know that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the iron. The weight of the water displaced can be calculated using the formula:\n\nWeight of water displaced = Volume of water displaced × Density of water × Acceleration due to gravity\n\nSince the iron is completely submerged in water, the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the iron, which is 500 cm³. We need to convert this volume to m³:\n\nVolume of water displaced = 500 cm³ × (1 m³ / 1,000,000 cm³) = 0.0005 m³\n\nThe density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³, and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². Now, we can calculate the weight of the water displaced:\n\nWeight of water displaced = 0.0005 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² = 4.905 N\n\nHowever, we calculated the buoyant force to be 0.9 N, so there must be a slight discrepancy in the given values. We will use the calculated buoyant force of 0.9 N to find the density of the iron.\n\nUsing Archimedes' principle, we can write the equation:\n\nBuoyant force = Volume of iron × Density of water × Acceleration due to gravity\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the density of iron:\n\nDensity of iron = (Buoyant force) / (Volume of iron × Acceleration due to gravity)\n\nDensity of iron = (0.9 N) / (0.0005 m³ × 9.81 m/s²)\nDensity of iron = 0.9 N / 0.004905 m³/s²\nDensity of iron ≈ 183.49 kg/m³\n\nSo, the density of the iron is approximately 183.49 kg/m³."
