    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Detecting the Higgs boson is challenging because it is unstable and decays rapidly into other particles. The methods used to detect the presence of the Higgs boson in particle collisions involve analyzing the decay products and their energy signatures.\n\nTwo primary methods are used to detect the Higgs boson:\n\n1. The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) experiment: This is a general-purpose particle detector designed to measure a wide range of particles and phenomena produced in high-energy collisions. It uses a combination of tracking detectors, calorimeters, and muon detectors to identify and measure the energy and momentum of the decay products.\n\n2. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment: This is another general-purpose detector with a similar goal as ATLAS. It uses a different design and technology, including a powerful solenoid magnet, to achieve high precision measurements of particles and their energies.\n\nBoth experiments look for specific decay channels that have a high probability of being associated with the Higgs boson. Some of the most important decay channels include:\n\n- Higgs boson decaying into two photons (H → γγ)\n- Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons, which then decay into four leptons (H → ZZ → 4ℓ)\n- Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons, which then decay into a lepton and a neutrino (H → WW → ℓνℓν)\n\nThe energy of the collision has a significant impact on the probability of detecting the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson has a mass of about 125 GeV (giga-electron volts), so the energy of the collision must be high enough to produce a Higgs boson. At the LHC, protons are accelerated to very high energies (up to 13 TeV) to increase the probability of Higgs boson production.\n\nHigher collision energies also lead to higher production rates of other particles, which can make it more challenging to identify the Higgs boson signal amidst the background noise. However, the advanced detectors and data analysis techniques used in the ATLAS and CMS experiments allow physicists to distinguish the Higgs boson signal from the background and confirm its presence."
