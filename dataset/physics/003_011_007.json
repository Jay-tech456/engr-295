    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance z on the axis of a uniformly charged disc of radius R carrying a current I along its circumference, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince we are dealing with a uniformly charged disc, we can consider a small ring of radius x and thickness dx on the disc. The circumference of this ring is 2πx, and the current on this ring is given by:\n\ndI = I * (2πx dx) / (2πR)\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field dB due to this small ring at a distance z on the axis. The position vector r is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + z²)\n\nThe angle between the current element (dI) and the position vector (r) is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r) / r³\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetrical along the axis, we only need to consider the vertical component of the magnetic field, dBz:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * z) / r³\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for dI:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (2πx dx) / (2πR) * dl * z) / r³\n\nThe infinitesimal length dl can be expressed in terms of dx as:\n\ndl = 2πx dx\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for dBz:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (2πx dx) / (2πR) * 2πx dx * z) / r³\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ * I * x dx * z) / (2 * R * r³)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire disc (from x = 0 to x = R):\n\nBz = ∫(μ₀ * I * x dx * z) / (2 * R * r³) from 0 to R\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I * z) / (2 * R) * ∫(x dx) / (x² + z²)^(3/2) from 0 to R\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet y = x / z, then x = yz and dx = z dy\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I * z) / (2 * R) * ∫(y z² dy) / (y²z² + z²)^(3/2) from 0 to R/z\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R) * ∫(y dy) / (y² + 1)^(3/2) from 0 to R/z\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R) * [ -sqrt(y² + 1) + C ] from 0 to R/z\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R) * [ -sqrt((R/z)² + 1) + sqrt(1) ]\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the positive z-axis (outward from the disc) since the current is flowing clockwise along the circumference of the disc.\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance z on the axis of a uniformly charged disc of radius R carrying a current I along its circumference are given by:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R) * [ 1 - sqrt((R/z)² + 1)^(-1) ] (in the positive z-direction)"
