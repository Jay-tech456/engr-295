    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (GM/c²) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the planet, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), R1 is the distance from the center of the planet to the surface, and R2 is the distance from the center of the planet to the observer.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given distances to meters:\nR1 = 6,371 km * 1,000 m/km = 6,371,000 m\nR2 = 10,000 km * 1,000 m/km = 10,000,000 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 5.97 x 10^24 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)² * (1/6,371,000 m - 1/10,000,000 m)\n\nΔλ/λ = (3.986 x 10^14 kg m³/s²) / (8.988 x 10^16 m²/s²) * (3.629 x 10^-7 m⁻¹)\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 0.000022\n\nThe gravitational redshift experienced by the photon is approximately 0.0022% or 2.2 x 10^-5."
