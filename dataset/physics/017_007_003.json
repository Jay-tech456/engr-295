    "message_2": "The topological nature of a material refers to the global properties of its electronic wavefunctions that are invariant under continuous deformations. In topological insulators and semimetals, these properties lead to unique electronic behaviors that are distinct from those of conventional materials.\n\nIn topological insulators, the bulk of the material is insulating, but the surface or edge states are conducting. These conducting states are protected by the material's topological properties, which make them robust against impurities and defects. This results in low-energy dissipation and high electron mobility, making topological insulators promising candidates for applications in electronics and spintronics.\n\nTopological semimetals, on the other hand, have their conduction and valence bands touching at discrete points or along lines in the Brillouin zone. These points or lines are protected by topological properties, leading to unique electronic behaviors such as extremely high electron mobility and unconventional quantum phenomena.\n\nTo experimentally verify the existence of topological states in these materials, several techniques can be employed:\n\n1. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES): This technique measures the energy and momentum of electrons ejected from a material when it is exposed to ultraviolet or X-ray photons. By analyzing the resulting data, researchers can map the electronic band structure of the material and identify the presence of topological surface states.\n\n2. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM): STM allows for the visualization of the electronic density of states at the atomic scale. By scanning the surface of a topological insulator or semimetal, researchers can directly observe the topological surface states and their spatial distribution.\n\n3. Transport measurements: By measuring the electrical conductivity of a material as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and other parameters, researchers can infer the presence of topological states. For example, the observation of the quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional topological insulator or the presence of a large, linear magnetoresistance in a topological semimetal can be indicative of their topological nature.\n\n4. Quantum oscillation measurements: By studying the oscillatory behavior of a material's magnetization or resistivity under a strong magnetic field, researchers can gain information about its Fermi surface and electronic properties. The observation of specific quantum oscillation patterns can be a signature of topological states.\n\nIn summary, the topological nature of a material affects its electronic properties by giving rise to protected surface or edge states in topological insulators and unique band-touching points or lines in topological semimetals. These properties can be experimentally verified using techniques such as ARPES, STM, transport measurements, and quantum oscillation measurements."
