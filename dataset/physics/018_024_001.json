    "message_2": "The fine-structure constant (α) is a dimensionless fundamental constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles. Its value is approximately 1/137, but more precisely, it is defined as:\n\nα = e² / (2 * ε₀ * h * c)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe current most precise measurement of the fine-structure constant is α ≈ 1/137.03599920611(51), with an uncertainty of 3.7 parts per billion. This value is obtained from a combination of experimental results, including measurements of the electron's magnetic moment and the quantum Hall effect.\n\nThe theoretically predicted value of α in the Standard Model of particle physics is not a fixed number but rather depends on the energy scale at which the electromagnetic interaction is probed. This is due to the phenomenon of renormalization, which causes the effective strength of the electromagnetic interaction to vary with energy. At low energies, the theoretical value of α is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. However, at higher energies, the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of α becomes more significant.\n\nThis discrepancy is one of the reasons why physicists believe that the Standard Model is not a complete description of the fundamental forces and particles in the universe. The search for a more comprehensive theory, such as a Grand Unified Theory or a Theory of Everything, aims to provide a more accurate prediction of the fine-structure constant and other fundamental constants at all energy scales."
