How precise would an experimental measurement need to be to significantly constrain models of new physics?",
    "message_2": "The rare decay of a B meson into a K meson and a pair of muons (B → Kμ⁺μ⁻) is a flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process that occurs at the loop level in the Standard Model (SM). The expected branching fraction for this decay within the SM is approximately (4.0 - 5.0) × 10⁻⁷, depending on the specific B meson and K meson involved (e.g., B⁺ → K⁺μ⁺μ⁻ or B⁰ → K*⁰μ⁺μ⁻).\n\nNew physics contributions could potentially modify this branching fraction. To significantly constrain models of new physics, experimental measurements of the branching fraction would need to be precise enough to detect deviations from the SM prediction. Typically, an experimental precision of around 10% or better would be required to provide meaningful constraints on new physics models.\n\nCurrent experimental measurements of the branching fraction for B → Kμ⁺μ⁻ decays are already at a level of precision that allows for testing the SM and probing for new physics. For example, the LHCb experiment at CERN has measured the branching fraction for B⁰ → K*⁰μ⁺μ⁻ to be (4.36 ± 0.15) × 10⁻⁷, which is consistent with the SM prediction. Further improvements in experimental precision, as well as measurements of related observables, will continue to provide valuable information on the possible presence of new physics in these rare decays."
