    "message_2": "Plasma-based cosmology, also known as plasma cosmology or electric universe theory, is an alternative approach to understanding the large-scale structure of the universe. It emphasizes the role of plasma and electromagnetic forces, rather than gravity, as the primary drivers of cosmic evolution. While this approach has not gained mainstream acceptance, it offers some interesting ideas for explaining the observed large-scale structure of the universe and the distribution of dark matter.\n\n1. Filamentary structure: Plasma-based cosmology suggests that the large-scale structure of the universe is shaped by vast networks of filamentary currents, known as Birkeland currents. These currents are formed by the movement of charged particles within plasma, and they can generate strong magnetic fields. According to this theory, the observed filamentary structure of galaxy clusters and superclusters can be explained by the interaction of these Birkeland currents, which attract and align galaxies along their paths.\n\n2. Dark matter: In plasma cosmology, dark matter is not considered as an exotic, unknown form of matter, but rather as a manifestation of the electromagnetic forces at play in the universe. The observed gravitational effects attributed to dark matter, such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing, can be explained by the presence of large-scale electric and magnetic fields generated by cosmic plasma. This approach eliminates the need for an undetected form of matter and instead focuses on the role of plasma and electromagnetic forces in shaping the universe.\n\n3. Galaxy formation: Plasma-based cosmology proposes that galaxies are formed by the interaction of Birkeland currents, which can create regions of high density and initiate the process of star formation. This process is driven by electromagnetic forces, rather than gravity, and can lead to the formation of spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and other observed structures.\n\n4. Cosmic microwave background (CMB): In plasma cosmology, the CMB is not considered as the relic radiation from the Big Bang, but rather as the result of synchrotron radiation emitted by cosmic plasma. This alternative explanation for the CMB challenges the standard cosmological model and offers a different perspective on the early universe.\n\nWhile plasma-based cosmology offers some intriguing ideas for explaining the large-scale structure of the universe and the distribution of dark matter, it is important to note that this approach has not been widely accepted by the scientific community. The standard model of cosmology, based on general relativity and the Big Bang theory, has been remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of observations, and any alternative theory would need to provide compelling evidence to challenge this established framework."
