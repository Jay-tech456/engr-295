    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens at different distances from the optical axis are focused at different points along the axis. This results in a blurred image. To determine the amount of spherical aberration, we need to find the difference in the focal lengths for the light rays passing through the edge of the lens and those passing through the center.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle of incidence for the light rays passing through the edge of the lens. We are given that the largest possible angle of incidence is 10 degrees. \n\nNow, we will use the lensmaker's equation to find the focal lengths for the light rays passing through the edge and the center of the lens. The lensmaker's equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since we are dealing with a parallel beam of light, we can assume that R1 and R2 are very large, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are approximately zero. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(0) = 0.\n\nThis means that the focal length is constant for all light rays passing through the lens, and there is no spherical aberration. However, this is an idealized situation, and in reality, there will be some spherical aberration due to the finite size of the lens.\n\nTo estimate the amount of spherical aberration, we can use the formula for the longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA):\n\nLSA = (d^3 * sin^3θ) / (64 * f^2 * n),\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the lens, θ is the angle of incidence, f is the focal length, and n is the refractive index of the lens material. \n\nAssuming the refractive index of the lens material is 1.5 (typical for glass), we can plug in the values:\n\nLSA = (8 * 10^-2 m^3 * sin^3(10°)) / (64 * (0.2 m)^2 * 1.5) = (8 * 10^-2 * 0.00463) / (0.0128) ≈ 0.0029 m.\n\nSo, the amount of spherical aberration in the image is approximately 2.9 mm."
