    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the size of an object placed at a distance of 20 cm from a converging lens with a focal length of 10 cm. If the image distance is 30 cm, what is the magnification of the image produced by the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image produced by the lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm\nu = -20 cm (object distance is taken as negative in the lens formula)\nv = 30 cm (image distance is positive since it's a real image)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/30\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60 (the least common multiple of 10, 20, and 30) to get rid of the fractions:\n6 = -3 + 2\n\nSolving for v:\nv = 30 cm (which we already knew)\n\nNow, we can use the magnification formula:\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\nm = -30 / (-20)\n\nm = 1.5\n\nSo, the magnification of the image produced by the lens is 1.5."
