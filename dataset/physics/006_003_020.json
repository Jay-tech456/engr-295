    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the Zeeman effect, which describes the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. In the case of a hydrogen atom, the energy level splitting is given by:\n\nΔE = m_j * e * B * h_bar / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere m_j is the magnetic quantum number (-1, 0, or 1 for hydrogen), e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), B is the magnetic field strength (0.5 T), h_bar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 J s), and m_e is the electron mass (9.11 x 10^-31 kg).\n\nFor the first line of the Balmer series, the transition occurs between the n = 2 and n = 3 energy levels. The magnetic quantum numbers for these levels are m_j = -1, 0, and 1. The energy level splitting for each m_j value is:\n\nΔE(-1) = -1 * e * B * h_bar / (2 * m_e)\nΔE(0) = 0\nΔE(1) = 1 * e * B * h_bar / (2 * m_e)\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in energy levels for each m_j value:\n\nΔE(-1) = -1 * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (0.5 T) * (1.054 x 10^-34 J s) / (2 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg) ≈ -1.44 x 10^-24 J\nΔE(0) = 0 J\nΔE(1) = 1 * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (0.5 T) * (1.054 x 10^-34 J s) / (2 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg) ≈ 1.44 x 10^-24 J\n\nThe difference in energy between the split lines is:\n\nΔE = ΔE(1) - ΔE(-1) = 1.44 x 10^-24 J - (-1.44 x 10^-24 J) = 2.88 x 10^-24 J\n\nNow, we can use the energy-wavelength relationship to find the difference in wavelength between the split lines:\n\nΔE = h * c * (1/λ_1 - 1/λ_2)\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ_1 and λ_2 are the wavelengths of the split lines. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n1/λ_1 - 1/λ_2 = ΔE / (h * c)\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n1/λ_1 - 1/λ_2 = (2.88 x 10^-24 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 J s * 3 x 10^8 m/s) ≈ 1.45 x 10^6 m^-1\n\nLet Δλ = λ_2 - λ_1. Then, we can use the approximation:\n\nΔλ / λ_1^2 ≈ 1/λ_1 - 1/λ_2\n\nSolving for Δλ, we get:\n\nΔλ ≈ λ_1^2 * (1/λ_1 - 1/λ_2)\n\nThe first line of the Balmer series corresponds to the Hα line, which has a wavelength of λ_1 ≈ 656.3 nm. Plugging this value into the equation, we find:\n\nΔλ ≈ (656.3 x 10^-9 m)^2 * (1.45 x 10^6 m^-1) ≈ 6.21 x 10^-13 m\n\nSo, the difference in wavelength between the split lines of the first line of the Balmer series is approximately 6.21 x 10^-13 m or 621 fm (femtometers)."
