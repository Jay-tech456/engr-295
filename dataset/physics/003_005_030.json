    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced at a distance of 10 cm from a straight current-carrying wire, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field strength,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A),\nI is the current in the wire (5 A),\nr is the distance from the wire (10 cm = 0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (20 × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.2\nB = 100 × 10⁻⁷ T\nB = 10 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced at a distance of 10 cm from the straight current-carrying wire is 10 μT (microteslas)."
