    "message_2": "In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the strong force is described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The running coupling constant for the strong force, denoted as αs, depends on the energy scale at which it is probed. The dependence of αs on the energy scale is given by the renormalization group equation, which is a consequence of the renormalization procedure in QFT.\n\nThe running coupling constant αs can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nαs(μ) = αs(μ0) / (1 + (αs(μ0) * β0 * ln(μ/μ0) / (2π)))\n\nHere, μ is the energy scale at which we want to calculate the coupling constant, μ0 is the reference energy scale, αs(μ0) is the coupling constant at the reference energy scale, and β0 is the first coefficient of the QCD beta function.\n\nThe QCD beta function is given by:\n\nβ(αs) = -β0 * (αs^2) / (2π) - β1 * (αs^3) / (4π^2) - ...\n\nFor simplicity, we will only consider the leading order term, which is the first term in the series. The coefficient β0 is given by:\n\nβ0 = (11 * Nc - 2 * Nf) / 3\n\nHere, Nc is the number of colors (in QCD, Nc = 3), and Nf is the number of active quark flavors at the energy scale μ. The number of active quark flavors depends on the energy scale, as different quarks have different masses and are only produced above their respective mass thresholds.\n\nTo calculate the running coupling constant αs at a given energy scale μ, we need to know the value of αs at a reference energy scale μ0. A common choice for the reference energy scale is the Z boson mass, μ0 = Mz ≈ 91.2 GeV. The value of αs(Mz) is determined experimentally, and the current world average is:\n\nαs(Mz) ≈ 0.118\n\nNow, we can use the equation for the running coupling constant to calculate αs(μ) for a given energy scale μ:\n\n1. Determine the number of active quark flavors Nf at the energy scale μ.\n2. Calculate the coefficient β0 using the formula β0 = (11 * Nc - 2 * Nf) / 3.\n3. Calculate the running coupling constant αs(μ) using the equation:\n\nαs(μ) = αs(Mz) / (1 + (αs(Mz) * β0 * ln(μ/Mz) / (2π)))\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation is only valid at leading order in perturbation theory. Higher-order corrections can be included for a more accurate result, but the calculation becomes more involved. Additionally, the running coupling constant αs is only well-defined in the perturbative regime, where αs << 1. At low energy scales, the strong coupling constant becomes large, and non-perturbative methods, such as lattice QCD, are required to study the strong force."
