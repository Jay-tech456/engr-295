    "message_1": "What is the length of a spaceship that travels at 0.8c (80% of the speed of light) in the frame of reference of a stationary observer if the length of the spaceship is 100 meters in its own rest frame? How much does the spaceship appear to be contracted to the stationary observer due to length contraction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as observed by the stationary observer, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length in the rest frame), v is the relative velocity between the observer and the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, L0 = 100 meters, v = 0.8c, and c = the speed of light.\n\nL = 100 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nL = 100 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL = 100 * sqrt(0.36)\nL = 100 * 0.6\nL = 60 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as observed by the stationary observer is 60 meters. The spaceship appears to be contracted by 40 meters (100 meters - 60 meters) due to length contraction."
