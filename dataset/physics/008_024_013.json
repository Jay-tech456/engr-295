    "message_2": "Distinguishing between the decay signatures of a W' boson and a Z' boson in collider experiments can be challenging, but there are some key differences in their decay modes that can be used to identify the particle being produced. Here are some of the observable differences between the two decay modes:\n\n1. Charge: W' bosons are charged particles (either positively or negatively charged), while Z' bosons are neutral. This means that the decay products of W' bosons will have a net charge, whereas those of Z' bosons will not. This can be observed in the detector by tracking the ionization of particles in the magnetic field.\n\n2. Decay channels: W' and Z' bosons have different preferred decay channels. W' bosons typically decay into a quark and an antiquark of different flavors or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. Z' bosons, on the other hand, decay into a quark-antiquark pair of the same flavor or into a lepton-antilepton pair. By analyzing the decay products and their properties, one can determine the likelihood of the parent particle being a W' or Z' boson.\n\n3. Mass: The masses of W' and Z' bosons are expected to be different, although their exact values are not yet known. By reconstructing the invariant mass of the decay products, one can estimate the mass of the parent particle and compare it to the expected mass range for W' and Z' bosons.\n\n4. Angular distributions: The angular distributions of the decay products can provide information about the spin and parity of the parent particle. W' and Z' bosons have different spin and parity properties, which can lead to different angular distributions in their decay products.\n\n5. Production cross-section: The production cross-sections for W' and Z' bosons are expected to be different, depending on the specific model and the energy of the collider. By measuring the production rate of the particles and comparing it to theoretical predictions, one can gain insight into the identity of the particle being produced.\n\nTo conclusively identify the particle being produced in a collider experiment, physicists typically combine information from multiple observables, such as those listed above. By performing a comprehensive analysis of the decay products and their properties, one can increase the confidence in the identification of the parent particle as either a W' or Z' boson."
