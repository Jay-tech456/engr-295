    "message_2": "The rotational velocity curve of a galaxy is a plot that shows the relationship between the distance from the galactic center and the orbital speed of objects (like stars and gas clouds) at that distance. In the case of the Milky Way galaxy, the rotational velocity curve can provide insights into the mass distribution and the presence of dark matter within the galaxy.\n\nFor a galaxy with a mass distribution similar to the Milky Way, we would expect the rotational velocity curve to follow the following pattern:\n\n1. At small distances from the galactic center, the rotational velocity should increase linearly with distance. This is because the mass enclosed within a given radius increases linearly with the radius, and the gravitational force acting on the objects in orbit is proportional to the enclosed mass.\n\n2. At larger distances, the rotational velocity should reach a peak and then start to decrease as the distance from the center increases. This is because the mass enclosed within a given radius increases more slowly at larger radii, and the gravitational force acting on the objects in orbit decreases as a result.\n\nHowever, observations of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies have shown that the rotational velocity curve does not follow this expected pattern. Instead, the curve remains relatively flat or even slightly increases at large distances from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the observed and expected rotational velocity curves is known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation for the galaxy rotation problem is the presence of dark matter, an invisible and non-luminous form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is thought to be distributed in a roughly spherical halo around the galaxy, extending far beyond the visible disk of stars and gas. The gravitational influence of this dark matter halo can explain the observed flat or slightly increasing rotational velocity curve at large distances from the galactic center.\n\nBy studying the rotational velocity curve of the Milky Way, astronomers can estimate the total mass of the galaxy, including both the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) and the dark matter. Current estimates suggest that the Milky Way has a total mass of about 1-2 trillion solar masses, with dark matter accounting for approximately 80-90% of this mass.\n\nIn summary, the rotational velocity curve of the Milky Way galaxy provides crucial information about the mass distribution within the galaxy and the presence of dark matter. The observed flat or slightly increasing curve at large distances from the galactic center supports the existence of dark matter, which is thought to make up a significant portion of the total mass of the galaxy."
