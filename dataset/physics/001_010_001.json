    "message_2": "The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect predicts a phase shift in the wave function of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field in the presence of a topologically nontrivial solenoid. This effect occurs even when the charged particle does not enter the region where the magnetic field is non-zero.\n\nThe phase shift (Δφ) due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔφ = (q/ħ) ∮ A·dl\n\nwhere q is the charge of the particle, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, A is the magnetic vector potential, and the integral is taken over the closed path around the solenoid.\n\nFor a solenoid with a magnetic field B inside and zero magnetic field outside, the magnetic flux (Φ) through the solenoid is given by:\n\nΦ = B·A\n\nwhere A is the area enclosed by the solenoid.\n\nUsing Stokes' theorem, we can rewrite the line integral of the magnetic vector potential as the surface integral of the magnetic field:\n\n∮ A·dl = ∬ B·dA\n\nSince the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid, the surface integral is equal to the magnetic flux through the solenoid:\n\n∮ A·dl = Φ\n\nNow, we can express the phase shift as:\n\nΔφ = (q/ħ) Φ\n\nThis equation shows that the phase shift of the wave function for a charged particle moving through a magnetic field in the presence of a topologically nontrivial solenoid is proportional to the magnetic flux through the solenoid and the charge of the particle."
