    "message_1": "A concave lens with a focal length of 10 cm is used to view an object placed 20 cm away from the lens. If the image is formed at a distance of 5 cm from the lens, what is the magnification of the object?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the object, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = -10 cm, since it's a concave lens), the object distance (u = -20 cm, negative because the object is on the same side as the image), and the image distance (v = 5 cm, positive because the image is on the opposite side of the lens).\n\nPlugging these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/5 - 1/(-20)\n\nMultiplying both sides by -20:\n\n2 = -4 + 1\n\n2 = -3\n\nThis result is not possible, as it contradicts the given information. It seems there is an error in the problem statement. Please check the given information and try again."
