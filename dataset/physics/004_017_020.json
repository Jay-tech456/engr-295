    "message_2": "The deflection of light around a massive object, such as a galaxy or a black hole, is a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This occurs because the massive object's gravity warps the spacetime around it, causing the path of light to bend as it passes near the object. The amount of deflection depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the light source, as well as the distance between the object and the observer.\n\nThe deflection angle (α) of light can be calculated using the following formula derived from the general theory of relativity:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- α is the deflection angle\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the massive object (in kilograms)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the impact parameter, which is the distance of closest approach between the light ray and the massive object (in meters)\n\nThe deflection angle is directly proportional to the mass of the object (M) and inversely proportional to the impact parameter (b). This means that the deflection of light increases with the mass of the object and decreases with the distance between the light ray and the object.\n\nThe relationship between the deflection angle, the mass of the object, and the distance from the observer can be quite complex, as it depends on the specific geometry of the situation. However, in general, the greater the distance between the observer and the massive object, the smaller the observed deflection angle will be."
