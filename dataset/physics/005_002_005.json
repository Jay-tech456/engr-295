    "message_1": "A spaceship moving at 0.8c relative to Earth measures its length to be 40 meters. What is the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth? (Assuming the spaceship is moving parallel to Earth.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the length measured by the observer on Earth (the contracted length), L0 is the proper length (the length measured by the spaceship itself, which is 40 meters in this case), v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the Earth (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nL = 40 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL = 40 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 40 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 40 * 0.6\n\nL = 24 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth is 24 meters."
