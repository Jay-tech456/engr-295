    "message_2": "To determine the location, size, and orientation of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance (distance of the candle from the mirror), and di is the image distance (distance of the image from the mirror).\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half of the radius of curvature (R):\nf = R/2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n1/5 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator (30) and rearrange the equation:\n6 - 1 = (30/di)\n5 = 30/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\ndi = 30/5 = 6 cm\n\nThe image is formed 6 cm in front of the mirror.\n\nNext, we can determine the size and orientation of the image using the magnification formula:\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nM = -6/30 = -1/5\n\nSince the magnification is negative, the image is inverted (upside-down). The absolute value of the magnification gives the size ratio between the image and the object. In this case, the image is 1/5 the size of the object (candle).\n\nIn summary, the image is formed 6 cm in front of the mirror, it is inverted, and its size is 1/5 of the size of the candle."
