    "message_2": "To calculate the time difference between the two clocks due to gravitational redshift, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔt/t = (ΔU/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time difference, t is the proper time, ΔU is the difference in gravitational potential energy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in gravitational potential energy between the top and bottom of the skyscraper. The formula for gravitational potential energy is:\n\nU = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height. Since we are only interested in the difference in potential energy, we can ignore the mass term, as it will cancel out:\n\nΔU = g * Δh\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for g and Δh:\n\nΔU = 9.81 m/s^2 * 50 m = 490.5 J/kg\n\nNext, we can plug this value into the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔt/t = (ΔU/c^2)\n\nΔt/t = (490.5 J/kg) / (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔt/t ≈ 1.83 x 10^-16\n\nNow, let's say we want to find the time difference after one day. The proper time (t) would be 24 hours, or 86400 seconds:\n\nΔt = (1.83 x 10^-16) * 86400 s\n\nΔt ≈ 1.58 x 10^-11 s\n\nSo, the time difference between the two clocks due to gravitational redshift after one day would be approximately 1.58 x 10^-11 seconds. This is a very small difference and would not be noticeable in everyday life."
