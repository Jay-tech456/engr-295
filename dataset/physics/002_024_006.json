Determine the heat required to convert 1 kg of water into steam at this temperature and pressure using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.",
    "message_2": "To determine the heat required to convert 1 kg of water into steam at 120°C and 1.5 atm, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, respectively\nT1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively (in Kelvin)\nΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization (in J/mol)\nR is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) at the given temperature and pressure. To do this, we will use the normal boiling point of water (100°C, 1 atm) as our reference state (P1, T1) and the given conditions (120°C, 1.5 atm) as our final state (P2, T2).\n\n1. Convert temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\nT2 = 120°C + 273.15 = 393.15 K\n\n2. Convert pressures to atm:\nP1 = 1 atm\nP2 = 1.5 atm\n\n3. Use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find ΔHvap:\nln(1.5/1) = -ΔHvap/8.314 * (1/393.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for ΔHvap, we get:\nΔHvap ≈ 40,660 J/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the heat required to convert 1 kg of water into steam at this temperature and pressure. \n\n4. Convert 1 kg of water to moles:\n1 kg of water = 1000 g\nMolar mass of water (H2O) = 18.015 g/mol\nNumber of moles (n) = 1000 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 55.56 mol\n\n5. Calculate the heat required (q) using the enthalpy of vaporization:\nq = n * ΔHvap\nq = 55.56 mol * 40,660 J/mol ≈ 2,259,000 J\n\nTherefore, the heat required to convert 1 kg of water into steam at 120°C and 1.5 atm is approximately 2,259,000 J."
