    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles, and ΔHf is the molar enthalpy of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar enthalpy of formation for the products is:\n\n2 moles of H₂O(g) × (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe molar enthalpy of formation for the reactants is:\n\n2 moles of H₂(g) × 0 kJ/mol + 1 mole of O₂(g) × 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change:\n\nΔH = (-571.6 kJ) - (0 kJ) = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ."
