    "message_1": "A charged pion (π+) with a rest mass of 139.6 MeV/c² decays into a muon (μ+) with a mass of 105.7 MeV/c² and a neutrino (νμ) with negligible mass. If the π+ is initially at rest, what is the minimum kinetic energy that the resulting muon must have in order for the decay to occur?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum kinetic energy of the muon, we can use the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, its energy is equal to its rest mass energy, which is given by E = mc², where m is the mass of the pion and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe total energy of the pion is:\n\nE_pion = 139.6 MeV\n\nAfter the decay, the total energy of the muon and neutrino must be equal to the initial energy of the pion. Since the mass of the neutrino is negligible, we can assume that its kinetic energy is also negligible. Therefore, the energy of the muon is:\n\nE_muon = E_pion = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe energy of the muon can be divided into its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy:\n\nE_muon = mc² + KE_muon\n\nwhere m is the mass of the muon, c is the speed of light, and KE_muon is the kinetic energy of the muon. We can rearrange this equation to find the kinetic energy of the muon:\n\nKE_muon = E_muon - mc²\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nKE_muon = 139.6 MeV - (105.7 MeV)\n\nKE_muon = 33.9 MeV\n\nSo, the minimum kinetic energy of the resulting muon for the decay to occur is 33.9 MeV."
