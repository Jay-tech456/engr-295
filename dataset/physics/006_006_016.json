    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine splitting energy in the ground state of the hydrogen atom, we need to consider the interaction between the proton's spin and the electron's spin. This interaction is given by the following formula:\n\nΔE = (μ_B * μ_N * g_e * g_p * hbar^2 * I * J) / (4 * π * ε_0 * h * r^3)\n\nwhere μ_B is the Bohr magneton, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, g_e and g_p are the electron and proton g-factors, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, I and J are the nuclear and electron spins, ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity, h is the Planck constant, and r is the distance between the proton and electron.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, we have the following values:\n\nμ_B = 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\nμ_N = 5.051 x 10^-27 J/T\ng_e = 2.0023 (for an electron)\ng_p = 5.585 (for a proton)\nhbar = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js\nI = 1/2 (for a proton)\nJ = 1/2 (for an electron in the ground state)\nε_0 = 8.854 x 10^-12 C^2/Nm^2\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js\nr = 5.29 x 10^-11 m (Bohr radius for the ground state of hydrogen)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 * 5.051 x 10^-27 * 2.0023 * 5.585 * (1.054 x 10^-34)^2 * 1/2 * 1/2) / (4 * π * 8.854 x 10^-12 * 6.626 x 10^-34 * (5.29 x 10^-11)^3)\n\nΔE ≈ 5.87 x 10^-6 eV\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed or emitted when an electron in the ground state of hydrogen undergoes a transition from state F=0 to F=1. We can use the following formula:\n\nν = ΔE / h\n\nwhere ν is the frequency and h is the Planck constant.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nν = (5.87 x 10^-6 eV) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, ΔE = 5.87 x 10^-6 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 9.41 x 10^-25 J\n\nNow, we can find the frequency:\n\nν = (9.41 x 10^-25 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) ≈ 1.42 x 10^9 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed or emitted when an electron in the ground state of hydrogen undergoes a transition from state F=0 to F=1 is approximately 1.42 x 10^9 Hz."
