    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum in the collision. Since the collision is elastic, both energy and momentum are conserved. Let's denote the initial and final velocities of the electron as v1 and v2, respectively, and the final velocity of the proton as vp.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial relativistic kinetic energy (KE) of the electron:\n\nKE1 = (γ1 - 1) * me * c^2\n\nwhere γ1 is the Lorentz factor for the initial velocity of the electron (v1 = 0.99c), me is the mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99^2) ≈ 7.0888\n\nNow, we can find the initial kinetic energy of the electron:\n\nKE1 = (7.0888 - 1) * me * c^2 ≈ 6.0888 * me * c^2\n\nNext, let's consider the conservation of momentum:\n\nInitial momentum = Final momentum\nme * v1 = me * v2 + mp * vp\n\nwhere mp is the mass of the proton.\n\nSince we are interested in the final kinetic energy of the electron, we need to find v2. We can rewrite the momentum conservation equation as:\n\nv2 = (me * v1 - mp * vp) / me\n\nNow, let's consider the conservation of energy:\n\nInitial KE = Final KE\nKE1 = KE2 + KEp\n\nwhere KE2 is the final kinetic energy of the electron and KEp is the final kinetic energy of the proton.\n\nKE2 = KE1 - KEp = 6.0888 * me * c^2 - KEp\n\nTo find KE2, we need to find KEp. We can express KEp in terms of the proton's mass and velocity:\n\nKEp = (γp - 1) * mp * c^2\n\nwhere γp is the Lorentz factor for the proton's final velocity (vp).\n\nNow, we have two unknowns (v2 and vp) and two equations (momentum conservation and energy conservation). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find v2 and then calculate the final kinetic energy of the electron (KE2).\n\nHowever, solving these equations analytically is quite complex. Instead, we can use numerical methods (e.g., iterative methods or computational software) to find the solution.\n\nOnce we have the value of v2, we can calculate the final kinetic energy of the electron (KE2) using the Lorentz factor for v2:\n\nγ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c)^2)\n\nKE2 = (γ2 - 1) * me * c^2\n\nThis will give us the relativistic kinetic energy of the electron after the collision."
