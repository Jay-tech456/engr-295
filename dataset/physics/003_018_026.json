    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a helical coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). To do this, we can use the pitch (p) and the length of one turn (l) of the helix:\n\nn = 1 / p\n\nThe length of one turn (l) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the circular cross-section of radius (r) and the pitch (p):\n\nl = √(p^2 + (2πr)^2)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nr = 4 cm = 0.04 m\np = 8 cm = 0.08 m\n\nl = √(0.08^2 + (2π × 0.04)^2) = √(0.0064 + 0.0314) = √0.0378 ≈ 0.194 m\n\nNow, we can find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = 1 / p = 1 / 0.08 = 12.5 turns/m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B) using the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (12.5 turns/m) * (1.5 A)\n\nB ≈ 2.36 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the helical coil is approximately 2.36 × 10^(-5) T."
