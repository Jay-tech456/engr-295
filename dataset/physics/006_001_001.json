    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state, we can use the ionization energy formula for hydrogen:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the ionization energy, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE = -13.6 eV\n\nThe energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 13.6 eV. Note that the negative sign indicates that the energy is required to remove the electron from the atom (ionization), so we report the value as positive 13.6 eV."
