    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a material, we can use the Curie-Weiss law, which is given by:\n\nχ = C / (T - θ)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. For paramagnetic materials, θ is typically close to 0, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nχ = C / T\n\nThe Curie constant (C) is given by:\n\nC = Nμ² / 3k\n\nwhere N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, μ is the magnetic moment per atom, and k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (N). We can do this by using the density (ρ) and the molar mass (M) of the material:\n\nN = ρNA / M\n\nwhere NA is Avogadro's number (NA ≈ 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) and ρ is the density of the material. Since we don't have the molar mass of the material, we can't calculate the exact value of N. However, we can express N in terms of the molar mass:\n\nN = (7 g/cm³ × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) / M\n\nNow, let's calculate the Curie constant (C):\n\nC = Nμ² / 3k\n\nWe are given the magnetic moment per atom (μ) as 2.5 Bohr magnetons. The value of one Bohr magneton (μB) is approximately 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T. Therefore, μ = 2.5 × 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T.\n\nC = ((7 g/cm³ × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) / M) × (2.5 × 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T)² / (3 × 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) at 300 K:\n\nχ = C / T\n\nχ = (((7 g/cm³ × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) / M) × (2.5 × 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T)² / (3 × 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)) / 300 K\n\nSince we don't have the molar mass (M) of the material, we can't provide an exact numerical value for the magnetic susceptibility (χ). However, we have expressed χ in terms of the molar mass, which can be used to calculate the magnetic susceptibility once the molar mass is known."
