    "message_2": "The gravitational force exerted by a black hole on an object depends on several factors, such as the mass of the black hole, the mass of the object, and the distance between them. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is given by:\n\nF = G * (M1 * M2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers of mass.\n\nFor a black hole, the mass is highly concentrated in an extremely small volume, and its gravitational pull becomes stronger as you get closer to its event horizon. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) defines the size of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole and is given by:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nAs an object approaches the event horizon, the gravitational force it experiences increases. However, it is important to note that the concept of \"force\" becomes less meaningful in the context of general relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass.\n\nIn any case, the maximum gravitational force that can be exerted on an object by a black hole would occur when the object is at the event horizon. At this point, the gravitational force is so strong that the object would need to travel at the speed of light to escape, which is impossible for objects with mass. Therefore, the maximum gravitational force would be the force required to hold the object at the event horizon, effectively making it impossible for the object to escape.\n\nIt is important to note that this analysis is based on classical physics and Newton's law of gravitation, which is an approximation that works well in most situations but may not be entirely accurate near the event horizon of a black hole. A more accurate analysis would require the use of general relativity, which is a more complex and mathematically involved theory."
