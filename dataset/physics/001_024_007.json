    "message_2": "To calculate the mutual information between the quantum system and the second heat bath, we first need to find the density matrices of the system and the second bath.\n\nLet's denote the Hamiltonian of the quantum system as H_S and the Hamiltonian of the second heat bath as H_B. Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the first heat bath at temperature T, the density matrix of the system can be written as:\n\nρ_S = exp(-βH_S) / Z_S,\n\nwhere β = 1/kT, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Z_S is the partition function of the system, given by:\n\nZ_S = Tr[exp(-βH_S)].\n\nSimilarly, the density matrix of the second heat bath at temperature T' can be written as:\n\nρ_B = exp(-β'H_B) / Z_B,\n\nwhere β' = 1/kT', and Z_B is the partition function of the second heat bath, given by:\n\nZ_B = Tr[exp(-β'H_B)].\n\nSince there is no interaction between the two heat baths, the total density matrix of the combined system is given by the tensor product of the individual density matrices:\n\nρ_total = ρ_S ⊗ ρ_B.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mutual information between the system and the second bath. The mutual information I(S;B) is given by:\n\nI(S;B) = S(ρ_S) + S(ρ_B) - S(ρ_total),\n\nwhere S(ρ) is the von Neumann entropy of a density matrix ρ, defined as:\n\nS(ρ) = -Tr[ρ log(ρ)].\n\nLet's calculate the individual entropies:\n\nS(ρ_S) = -Tr[ρ_S log(ρ_S)] = -Tr[ρ_S (-βH_S - log(Z_S))] = βTr[ρ_S H_S] + log(Z_S),\n\nS(ρ_B) = -Tr[ρ_B log(ρ_B)] = -Tr[ρ_B (-β'H_B - log(Z_B))] = β'Tr[ρ_B H_B] + log(Z_B),\n\nS(ρ_total) = -Tr[ρ_total log(ρ_total)] = -Tr[(ρ_S ⊗ ρ_B) (log(ρ_S) ⊗ I + I ⊗ log(ρ_B))] = S(ρ_S) + S(ρ_B),\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix.\n\nNow, we can find the mutual information:\n\nI(S;B) = S(ρ_S) + S(ρ_B) - S(ρ_total) = S(ρ_S) + S(ρ_B) - (S(ρ_S) + S(ρ_B)) = 0.\n\nThe mutual information between the quantum system and the second heat bath is zero, which indicates that there is no correlation between the two systems. This result is expected since there is no interaction between the two heat baths."
