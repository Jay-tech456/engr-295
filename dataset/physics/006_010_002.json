    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, the minimum distance of closest approach (also known as the impact parameter) between an alpha particle and a gold nucleus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd_min = (k * e^2) / (2 * E)\n\nwhere:\n- d_min is the minimum distance of closest approach\n- k is the Coulomb constant, approximately 8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^(-2)\n- e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 × 10^(-19) C\n- E is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle\n\nIn this formula, the charges of the alpha particle and gold nucleus are taken into account, as well as the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle. The electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged alpha particle and gold nucleus is responsible for the scattering observed in the experiment."
