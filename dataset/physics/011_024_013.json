    "message_2": "The topological invariant of a two-dimensional topological insulator with a honeycomb lattice structure and spin-orbit coupling is the Chern number. The Chern number is an integer that characterizes the global topological properties of the system and is related to the Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone. In the case of a two-dimensional topological insulator, the Chern number is associated with the quantum Hall effect and quantized conductance."
