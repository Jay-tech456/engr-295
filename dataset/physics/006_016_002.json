    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the radio wave needed to induce a 90-degree rotation of the nuclear magnetic moment in a hydrogen atom, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γ * B\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen (γ) as 42.58 MHz/T and the magnetic field strength (B) as 2 Tesla, we can calculate the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = 42.58 MHz/T * 2 T = 85.16 MHz\n\nNow, we can convert the angular frequency (ω) to the linear frequency (f) using the following equation:\n\nf = ω / (2 * π)\n\nf = 85.16 MHz / (2 * π) ≈ 13.55 MHz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the radio wave needed to induce a 90-degree rotation of the nuclear magnetic moment in a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 2 Tesla is approximately 13.55 MHz."
