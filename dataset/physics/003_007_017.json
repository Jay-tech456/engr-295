    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of a straight copper rod carrying a current of 3 A, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\nI is the current (3 A)\nr is the distance from the center of the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12 × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the straight copper rod is 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla)."
