    "message_2": "The solutions to the Einstein field equations for a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass distribution are described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Schwarzschild metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein field equations, which means that it describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution with no other matter or energy present. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r) dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1) dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates (time, radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle, respectively).\n\nGravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the curvature of spacetime caused by a massive object. This bending of light can cause multiple images of a distant object to appear, or even create a ring-like structure known as an \"Einstein ring\" if the alignment between the observer, the lensing mass, and the distant object is perfect.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is related to gravitational lensing because it describes the spacetime curvature around a spherically symmetric mass distribution, which is responsible for bending the path of light. Using the Schwarzschild metric, one can derive the deflection angle of light as it passes near a massive object. This deflection angle is given by:\n\nα = 4GM/c²b\n\nwhere b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance the light would pass by the massive object if it were not deflected.\n\nBy studying the deflection angle and the geometry of the lensing system, one can predict the positions and magnifications of the lensed images, as well as determine the mass and other properties of the lensing object. Gravitational lensing has become an important tool in astrophysics, allowing the study of dark matter, the determination of the Hubble constant, and the discovery of exoplanets, among other applications."
