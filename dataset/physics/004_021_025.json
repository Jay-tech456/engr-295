    "message_2": "The minimum mass a star needs to have before it undergoes gravitational collapse and forms a black hole is typically around 3 times the mass of our Sun. This threshold is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is the maximum mass a neutron star can have before it collapses into a black hole. However, it's important to note that not all stars with masses above this limit will directly form black holes; many will undergo supernova explosions and lose mass before collapsing.\n\nThe minimum mass required for a star to form a black hole can be influenced by its composition. Stars are mainly composed of hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements (collectively called \"metals\" in astrophysics). The proportion of these elements can affect the star's evolution, structure, and eventual fate.\n\nA star with a higher metallicity (i.e., a higher proportion of heavier elements) will have a higher opacity, meaning that it is more difficult for radiation to escape from the star. This can lead to a larger and more extended outer envelope, which can affect the star's evolution and the processes that occur during its final stages. In some cases, this can increase the likelihood of the star undergoing a supernova explosion and losing mass, making it less likely to form a black hole.\n\nOn the other hand, stars with lower metallicity may have a higher chance of directly collapsing into a black hole, as they may not lose as much mass during their evolution. However, the relationship between metallicity and black hole formation is complex and depends on various factors, such as the star's initial mass and rotation rate.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass for a star to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole is around 3 solar masses, but this value can be influenced by the star's composition, among other factors."
