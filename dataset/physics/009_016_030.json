    "message_2": "To calculate the width of the central bright spot in a diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for the angular width of the central maximum in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = 2 * arcsin(λ / (2 * a))\n\nwhere θ is the angular width of the central maximum, λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\nSlit width (a) = 0.05 mm = 0.05 * 10^(-3) m\nDistance to the screen (L) = 2 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular width of the central maximum:\n\nθ = 2 * arcsin(λ / (2 * a))\nθ = 2 * arcsin((600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 0.05 * 10^(-3)))\nθ = 2 * arcsin(6 * 10^(-7) / 10^(-4))\nθ = 2 * arcsin(0.006)\n\nθ ≈ 2 * 0.006 (since arcsin(x) ≈ x for small angles)\nθ ≈ 0.012 radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the width of the central bright spot on the screen:\n\nWidth = L * θ\nWidth = 2 m * 0.012 radians\nWidth ≈ 0.024 m\n\nSo, the width of the central bright spot in the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.024 meters or 24 mm."
