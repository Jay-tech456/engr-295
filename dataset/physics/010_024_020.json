    "message_2": "The critical mass for a protostar to initiate nuclear fusion at its core is approximately 0.08 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). This is the minimum mass required for a protostar to have enough gravitational pressure and temperature at its core to start fusing hydrogen into helium, which marks the beginning of its life as a main-sequence star.\n\nThe mass of a star plays a crucial role in determining its eventual fate. Here's a general overview of how a star's mass affects its evolution and final state:\n\n1. Low-mass stars (0.08 to 0.5 solar masses): These stars have relatively low core temperatures and burn their hydrogen fuel slowly. They eventually evolve into red dwarfs and can last for trillions of years. When they exhaust their fuel, they become white dwarfs, which are the remnants of low-mass stars that have shed their outer layers and no longer undergo nuclear fusion.\n\n2. Mid-mass stars (0.5 to 8 solar masses): These stars, like our Sun, have higher core temperatures and burn their hydrogen fuel more quickly. They eventually expand into red giants as they exhaust their hydrogen fuel and start fusing helium into heavier elements. After shedding their outer layers, they also become white dwarfs.\n\n3. High-mass stars (8 to 20 solar masses): These stars have even higher core temperatures and burn their fuel rapidly. They expand into red supergiants and undergo a series of nuclear fusion processes, creating heavier elements up to iron. When they exhaust their fuel, their cores collapse, triggering a supernova explosion. The remnant core can become a neutron star, which is an incredibly dense object composed mostly of neutrons.\n\n4. Very high-mass stars (greater than 20 solar masses): These stars follow a similar evolutionary path as high-mass stars but have even more extreme core temperatures and pressures. After a supernova explosion, if the remnant core has a mass greater than around 2.5 to 3 solar masses, it can collapse further to form a black hole, which is a region of spacetime with such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a star determines its rate of nuclear fusion, its evolutionary path, and its eventual fate as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole."
