    "message_2": "To calculate the change in vapor pressure with respect to temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nd(ln(P)) / dT = ΔH_vap / (RT^2)\n\nwhere:\n- P is the vapor pressure\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- ΔH_vap is the heat of vaporization\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nd(ln(P)) / dT = (44.0 kJ/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × (298.15 K)^2)\n\nNote that we need to convert the heat of vaporization from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔH_vap = 44.0 kJ/mol × 1000 J/kJ = 44000 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nd(ln(P)) / dT = (44000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × (298.15 K)^2)\n\nd(ln(P)) / dT ≈ 0.00163 K^(-1)\n\nSo, the change in vapor pressure of water at 25°C with respect to temperature when the heat of vaporization is 44.0 kJ/mol is approximately 0.00163 K^(-1)."
