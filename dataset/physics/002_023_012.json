    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and T1 are the reference vapor pressure and temperature, P2 and T2 are the vapor pressure and temperature we want to find, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nFor water, we can use the reference values of P1 = 1 atm at the boiling point, T1 = 373.15 K (100°C). We want to find the vapor pressure at T2 = 80°C, which is equivalent to 353.15 K. The heat of vaporization, ΔHvap, is given as 40.7 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 40700 J/mol. The ideal gas constant, R, is 8.314 J/(mol·K).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nln(P2/1 atm) = -40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol·K) * (1/353.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nln(P2) = -40700 / 8.314 * (-0.000537)\n\nln(P2) ≈ 2.197\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to find P2:\n\nP2 ≈ e^2.197 ≈ 9.00 atm\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 80°C is approximately 9.00 atm."
