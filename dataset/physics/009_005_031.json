    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification of the image formed, we can use the mirror equation and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (R):\nf = R/2 = 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n1/15 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator (60) and rearrange the equation:\n4 - 3 = 60/di\n1 = 60/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\ndi = 60 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is 60 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\nM = -60/20\nM = -3\n\nThe magnification of the image is -3, which means the image is inverted and three times larger than the object."
