    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, we need to find the current enclosed by a circle of radius r (where r < R) inside the cylinder. Since the current is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area, we can find the current density (J) as follows:\n\nJ = I / (πR²)\n\nNow, the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the circle of radius r can be calculated as:\n\nI_enclosed = J * (πr²) = (I / (πR²)) * (πr²) = I * (r² / R²)\n\nNext, we consider a circular Amperian loop of radius r inside the cylinder. The magnetic field (B) is tangential to the loop, and its magnitude is the same at every point on the loop. Therefore, the closed line integral of B around the loop can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I * (r² / R²)\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πR²)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the cylinder, where r < R."
