    "message_2": "The maximum theoretical velocity that can be achieved by a spacecraft using a plasma thruster for propulsion can be determined using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which is given by:\n\nΔv = Ve * ln(m0 / mf)\n\nwhere Δv is the change in velocity, Ve is the effective exhaust velocity, m0 is the initial mass of the spacecraft (including fuel), and mf is the final mass of the spacecraft (excluding fuel).\n\nIn this case, we are assuming a constant exhaust velocity and neglecting gravitational effects. The maximum theoretical velocity would be achieved when all the fuel has been expended, so the spacecraft's mass is at its minimum (mf).\n\nHowever, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation does not provide an absolute maximum velocity, as it depends on the ratio of initial to final mass (m0 / mf). The higher this ratio, the greater the Δv that can be achieved. In practice, the maximum theoretical velocity would be limited by factors such as the efficiency of the plasma thruster, the amount of fuel that can be carried, and the structural integrity of the spacecraft.\n\nIn summary, there is no fixed maximum theoretical velocity for a spacecraft using a plasma thruster, as it depends on the specific design and fuel capacity of the spacecraft. However, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation can be used to estimate the change in velocity achievable for a given spacecraft and fuel load."
