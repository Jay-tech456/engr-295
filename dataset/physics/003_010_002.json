    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the axis of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a long cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (4 cm in this case) as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field is constant along this loop, so we can write:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the loop of radius 4 cm. Since the wire has a radius of 2 cm and carries a total current of 5 A, we can find the current density (J) in the wire:\n\nJ = I_total / (πR²)\nJ = 5 A / (π(0.02 m)²)\nJ = 5 A / (π(0.0004 m²))\nJ = 5 A / (1.2566 x 10⁻³ m²)\nJ = 3978.87 A/m²\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current within the loop of radius 4 cm. Since the loop is outside the wire, the entire current of the wire is enclosed:\n\nI_enclosed = 5 A\n\nNow we can find the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 4 cm (0.04 m) from the axis of the wire:\n\nB * 2π(0.04 m) = μ₀(5 A)\nB = (μ₀(5 A)) / (2π(0.04 m))\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π x 10⁻⁷ Tm/A. Plugging this value into the equation:\n\nB = ((4π x 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)(5 A)) / (2π(0.04 m))\nB = (20π x 10⁻⁷ Tm) / (0.08 m)\nB = (20 x 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.08\nB = 2 x 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the axis of the wire is 2 x 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
