Provide a detailed explanation of the electroweak theory and the experimental evidence that supports it.",
    "message_2": "The electroweak theory is a unified description of two of the four fundamental forces in nature: electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. This unification is based on the idea that these two forces are different manifestations of a single, more fundamental force called the electroweak force. The electroweak theory was developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for their work.\n\nThe mechanism behind the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force is the concept of gauge symmetry. In the electroweak theory, the fundamental particles (quarks and leptons) interact through the exchange of force-carrying particles called gauge bosons. There are four gauge bosons in the electroweak theory: the photon (responsible for electromagnetism), the W+ and W- bosons, and the Z boson (responsible for the weak force).\n\nAt high energies, the electromagnetic and weak forces become indistinguishable, and the W+, W-, and Z bosons have the same mass. However, at lower energies, the symmetry between the forces is broken through a process called spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is where the Higgs mechanism comes into play.\n\nThe Higgs mechanism, proposed by Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s, is a theoretical framework that explains how the gauge bosons acquire mass and why the weak force has a much shorter range than electromagnetism. The Higgs mechanism introduces a new field, the Higgs field, which permeates all of space. When the electroweak symmetry is broken, the W and Z bosons interact with the Higgs field and acquire mass, while the photon remains massless. This mass difference between the gauge bosons is what causes the weak force to have a shorter range than electromagnetism.\n\nThe Higgs mechanism also predicts the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, which is a manifestation of the Higgs field. The Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, providing experimental evidence for the Higgs mechanism and the electroweak theory.\n\nOther experimental evidence supporting the electroweak theory includes the observation of neutral current interactions (mediated by the Z boson) in neutrino experiments, the discovery of the W and Z bosons at CERN in the 1980s, and precision measurements of electroweak parameters at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and other experiments. These results have confirmed the predictions of the electroweak theory and established it as a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics."
