    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum length of the optical fiber that allows total internal reflection to occur. We can use the critical angle formula and Snell's Law to determine the maximum angle of incidence for the light entering the fiber.\n\nThe critical angle formula is:\n\nsin(critical angle) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere n1 is the index of refraction of the medium the light is coming from (air, in this case, with an index of refraction of approximately 1.00), and n2 is the index of refraction of the optical fiber (1.50).\n\nsin(critical angle) = 1.00 / 1.50\ncritical angle = arcsin(2/3) ≈ 42 degrees\n\nNow we can use Snell's Law to find the maximum angle of incidence for the light entering the fiber:\n\nn1 * sin(angle of incidence) = n2 * sin(angle of refraction)\n\nSince the angle of refraction is the critical angle:\n\n1.00 * sin(angle of incidence) = 1.50 * sin(42 degrees)\n\nSolving for the angle of incidence:\n\nsin(angle of incidence) = 1.50 * sin(42 degrees)\nangle of incidence = arcsin(1.50 * sin(42 degrees)) ≈ 65.5 degrees\n\nNow we can use trigonometry to find the maximum length of the optical fiber. The angle of incidence and the radius of the fiber form a right triangle, with the radius being the opposite side and the length of the fiber being the adjacent side. We can use the tangent function to find the length of the fiber:\n\ntan(angle of incidence) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(65.5 degrees) = 50 micrometers / adjacent side\n\nSolving for the adjacent side (length of the fiber):\n\nadjacent side = 50 micrometers / tan(65.5 degrees) ≈ 26.3 micrometers\n\nSo the maximum length of the optical fiber that can transmit light to the far end is approximately 26.3 micrometers."
