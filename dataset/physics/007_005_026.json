    "message_1": "One common method for disposing of nuclear waste is to bury it in geological repositories deep underground. If a nuclear waste canister leaks, the potential for contamination of the surrounding environment is a major concern. If we assume that a canister contains 1000 liters of nuclear waste, how deep would the canister need to be buried in order for the radiation level at the surface to be safe for humans? Assume that the canister has a radiation level of 100 millisieverts per hour and use the inverse square law formula to determine the distance required for the radiation level to drop to 1 millisievert per hour, which is considered safe for humans according to international standards.",
    "message_2": "The inverse square law states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. In this case, we want to find the distance (depth) at which the radiation level drops from 100 millisieverts per hour to 1 millisievert per hour. \n\nLet's denote the initial radiation level as I1 (100 millisieverts per hour) and the final radiation level as I2 (1 millisievert per hour). Similarly, let's denote the initial distance as r1 and the final distance (depth) as r2. According to the inverse square law, we have:\n\nI1 / I2 = (r2 / r1)^2\n\nWe want to find r2, the depth at which the radiation level is safe. Since the canister is the source of radiation, we can assume r1 to be very close to 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n100 / 1 = (r2 / r1)^2\n\n100 = (r2 / r1)^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n10 = r2 / r1\n\nSince r1 is very close to 0, we can assume that r2 is approximately 10 times greater than r1. This means that the canister needs to be buried at a depth that is 10 times greater than the distance from the canister to the point where the radiation level is 100 millisieverts per hour.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific geometry of the canister and the distribution of radiation, it is impossible to provide an exact depth. This calculation only provides a rough estimate based on the inverse square law. In practice, additional factors such as the type of soil, rock, and other geological features would need to be considered to determine the appropriate depth for burying nuclear waste."
