    "message_2": "The W and Z bosons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for mediating the weak nuclear force, which is one of the four fundamental forces in nature. The masses of these bosons are crucial parameters in the Standard Model, and their experimental measurements have been found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n\nThe measured masses of the W and Z bosons are approximately 80.4 GeV/c² and 91.2 GeV/c², respectively. The theoretical masses predicted by the Standard Model are also close to these values, with uncertainties in the range of a few hundred MeV/c². The precise agreement between the measured and predicted masses of the W and Z bosons is a strong confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model and the electroweak force theory.\n\nThis agreement also has significant implications for our understanding of the Higgs mechanism, which is responsible for giving masses to the W and Z bosons, as well as other fundamental particles. The Higgs mechanism is a crucial component of the electroweak force theory, and the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provided further evidence for the validity of this mechanism.\n\nThe close match between the measured and predicted masses of the W and Z bosons indicates that the Higgs mechanism is working as expected in the context of the Standard Model. This agreement also constrains possible extensions of the Standard Model, such as theories with additional Higgs bosons or other new particles that could affect the masses of the W and Z bosons.\n\nIn summary, the agreement between the measured and expected theoretical masses of the W and Z bosons is a strong confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics, the electroweak force theory, and the Higgs mechanism. This agreement also provides important constraints on possible new physics beyond the Standard Model."
