Assume the final black hole mass is 49 solar masses and the merger lasts for 0.1 seconds. Use the formula for gravitational wave power radiated by binary inspiral and merger events.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for gravitational wave power radiated by binary inspiral and merger events, which is given by:\n\nP = (32/5) * (G^4 / c^5) * (m1 * m2)^2 * (m1 + m2) * f^5\n\nwhere P is the power radiated, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes, and f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the black holes to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nm1 = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nm2 = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe total mass of the system is:\n\nM = m1 + m2 = 5.967 x 10^31 kg + 3.978 x 10^31 kg = 9.945 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe reduced mass of the system is:\n\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (5.967 x 10^31 kg * 3.978 x 10^31 kg) / (9.945 x 10^31 kg) = 2.381 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we know that the final black hole mass is 49 solar masses, which is:\n\nM_final = 49 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 9.746 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe energy radiated during the merger is the difference between the initial total mass and the final mass:\n\nΔE = (M - M_final) * c^2 = (9.945 x 10^31 kg - 9.746 x 10^31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 1.99 x 10^47 J\n\nSince the merger lasts for 0.1 seconds, the average power radiated during the merger is:\n\nP_avg = ΔE / t = 1.99 x 10^47 J / 0.1 s = 1.99 x 10^48 W\n\nNow, we can use the formula for gravitational wave power radiated to find the frequency:\n\nf = ((5/32) * (c^5 / G^4) * (1 / (m1 * m2)^2) * (1 / (m1 + m2)) * P_avg)^(1/5)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf ≈ 150 Hz\n\nNow, to find the amplitude of the gravitational waves, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * (π * f)^2) / (c^4 * r)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, and r is the distance from the source. Note that the amplitude depends on the distance from the source, so we cannot determine the amplitude without knowing the distance to the black holes.\n\nIn summary, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger of the two black holes is approximately 150 Hz. The amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the distance from the source."
