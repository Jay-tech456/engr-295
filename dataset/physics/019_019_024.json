    "message_2": "Calculating the anomalous dimensions in a conformal field theory (CFT) with a non-Abelian global symmetry using conformal bootstrap methods involves several steps. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Identify the primary operators: In a CFT, primary operators are the building blocks of the theory. They transform covariantly under the conformal group and are classified by their scaling dimensions and representations under the global symmetry group.\n\n2. Construct the conformal blocks: Conformal blocks are the basic building blocks of the four-point correlation functions in a CFT. They encode the contribution of a primary operator and its descendants to the correlation function. Conformal blocks can be computed using the conformal Casimir equation or by using recursion relations.\n\n3. Impose crossing symmetry: The crossing symmetry constraint is a fundamental consistency condition in CFTs. It states that the four-point correlation function of primary operators must be invariant under the exchange of operators. This leads to an equation relating the OPE coefficients and the conformal blocks.\n\n4. Analyze the constraints: The crossing symmetry constraint can be analyzed using numerical bootstrap methods. This involves truncating the conformal block expansion and solving the resulting linear system of equations. The solution space of this system provides bounds on the scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients of the primary operators in the CFT.\n\n5. Scan the parameter space: By scanning the parameter space of scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients, one can obtain allowed regions for the anomalous dimensions of the primary operators. These regions can be refined by increasing the truncation order of the conformal block expansion and by imposing additional constraints, such as unitarity and global symmetry.\n\n6. Identify the CFT: Once the allowed regions for the anomalous dimensions have been obtained, one can try to identify the underlying CFT by comparing the results with known CFTs or by constructing new CFTs that match the obtained constraints.\n\nIn summary, calculating the anomalous dimensions in a CFT with a non-Abelian global symmetry using conformal bootstrap methods involves identifying primary operators, constructing conformal blocks, imposing crossing symmetry, analyzing the constraints, scanning the parameter space, and identifying the underlying CFT. This approach has been successful in determining the anomalous dimensions in various CFTs, including those with non-Abelian global symmetries."
