    "message_2": "The rate of shear stress (τ) in a fluid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nτ = μ * (du/dy)\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and (du/dy) is the velocity gradient.\n\nGiven the dynamic viscosity (μ) as 0.1 Pa.s and the velocity gradient (du/dy) as 500 s^(-1), we can calculate the rate of shear stress:\n\nτ = 0.1 Pa.s * 500 s^(-1)\n\nτ = 50 Pa\n\nThe rate of shear stress is 50 Pa."
