    "message_2": "To find the amount of energy required to change 100 grams of ice at -10℃ to liquid water at 10℃, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10℃ to 0℃\n2. Melting the ice at 0℃\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0℃ to 10℃\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10℃ to 0℃\nQ1 = mass × specific heat capacity of ice × temperature change\nQ1 = 100 g × 2.108 J/g℃ × (0 - (-10))℃\nQ1 = 100 g × 2.108 J/g℃ × 10℃\nQ1 = 2116 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0℃\nQ2 = mass × latent heat of fusion of ice\nQ2 = 100 g × 334 J/g\nQ2 = 33400 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0℃ to 10℃\nQ3 = mass × specific heat capacity of water × temperature change\nQ3 = 100 g × 4.184 J/g℃ × (10 - 0)℃\nQ3 = 100 g × 4.184 J/g℃ × 10℃\nQ3 = 4184 J\n\nNow, we add the energy required for all three steps:\nTotal energy required (Q) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3\nQ = 2116 J + 33400 J + 4184 J\nQ = 39700 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to change 100 grams of ice at -10℃ to liquid water at 10℃ is 39,700 J (joules)."
