    "message_2": "In the framework of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the cross-section of the scattering process of two particles with initial momenta p1 and p2, and final momenta p3 and p4, mediated by the exchange of a virtual particle with momentum q, can be calculated using the S-matrix (scattering matrix) formalism. The S-matrix relates the initial and final states of a scattering process.\n\nThe expression for the cross-section can be written in terms of the matrix element of the S-matrix, which is given by the Feynman amplitude (M) for the process. The differential cross-section dσ can be expressed as:\n\ndσ = (1 / flux) * |M|^2 * dPS,\n\nwhere |M|^2 is the squared amplitude of the Feynman diagram representing the process, dPS is the Lorentz-invariant phase space factor, and flux is the initial flux of the incoming particles.\n\nThe Feynman amplitude (M) is calculated using Feynman rules, which are derived from the Lagrangian of the theory. The Feynman rules assign mathematical expressions to each vertex, propagator, and external line in the Feynman diagram. The virtual particle exchange is represented by a propagator in the diagram.\n\nThe expression for the cross-section is related to the underlying physics of the scattering process because it quantifies the probability of the process occurring. The Feynman amplitude (M) encodes the interactions between the particles in the process, and the phase space factor (dPS) accounts for the available final states. The cross-section is an essential quantity in predicting the outcomes of particle collisions and understanding the fundamental forces in nature.\n\nIn summary, the expression for the cross-section of the scattering process in QFT is given in terms of the Feynman amplitude, which is calculated using Feynman rules derived from the Lagrangian of the theory. The cross-section quantifies the probability of the process occurring and is essential for understanding the underlying physics of particle interactions."
