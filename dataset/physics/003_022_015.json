    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nSince the wire is wrapped into a circular loop, the magnetic field at the center of the loop will be the same for each segment of the wire, and we can calculate the total magnetic field by summing up the contributions from each segment.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of turns in the loop. The length of the wire is 10 cm, and the circumference of the loop is given by:\n\nC = 2 * π * r = 2 * π * 5 cm = 10 * π cm\n\nNow, we can find the number of turns (n) by dividing the length of the wire by the circumference of the loop:\n\nn = Length / C = 10 cm / (10 * π cm) = 1/π turns\n\nSince the magnetic field at the center of the loop is the same for each segment of the wire, we can calculate the total magnetic field by multiplying the magnetic field due to one turn by the number of turns:\n\nB_total = n * B\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to one turn:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r) = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^-7 Tm/A) / (0.1π m) = 8 × 10^-6 T\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB_total = n * B = (1/π) * (8 × 10^-6 T) ≈ 2.55 × 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 2.55 × 10^-6 T."
