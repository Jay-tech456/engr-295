    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point directly above the center of the sheet, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying rectangular loop (Ampere's Law). The formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (a * b)) / (2 * π * (a^2 + b^2 + h^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a and b are the dimensions of the rectangular sheet, and h is the distance from the center of the sheet to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the sheet (a = 20 cm, b = 30 cm), the current (I = 2 A), and the distance (h = 5 cm), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.2 m * 0.3 m)) / (2 * π * (0.2^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.05^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.06 m^2) / ((0.04 + 0.09 + 0.0025)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4.8π × 10^(-7) T) / (0.1315^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane of the rectangular sheet, pointing outwards from the sheet (using the right-hand rule). In this case, it will be pointing directly upwards from the center of the sheet.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point directly above the center of the sheet, 5 cm away, is approximately 1.14 × 10^(-5) T, and its direction is upwards."
