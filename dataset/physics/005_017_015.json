    "message_2": "To determine the trajectory of both particles from the perspective of an observer at rest relative to the particles, we can use the Lorentz transformation equations for space and time coordinates. The Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nx' = γ(x - vt)\nt' = γ(t - vx/c²)\n\nwhere x and t are the space and time coordinates in the rest frame of the observer, x' and t' are the space and time coordinates in the moving frame, v is the relative velocity between the two frames, c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nFor the first particle moving with a velocity of 0.6c along the x-axis, the Lorentz factor is:\n\nγ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8\n\nFor the second particle moving with a velocity of 0.8c in the opposite direction along the x-axis, the Lorentz factor is:\n\nγ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the trajectory of both particles in the observer's frame.\n\nFor the first particle:\n\nx₁' = γ₁(x - 0.6ct)\nt₁' = γ₁(t - 0.6x/c²)\n\nFor the second particle:\n\nx₂' = γ₂(x + 0.8ct)\nt₂' = γ₂(t + 0.8x/c²)\n\nThese equations describe the trajectory of both particles from the perspective of an observer at rest relative to the particles. The observer will see the first particle moving with a velocity of 0.6c along the x-axis and the second particle moving with a velocity of 0.8c in the opposite direction along the same x-axis."
