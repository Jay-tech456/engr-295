    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) of the hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0ħ²) / (me²)\n\nwhere ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, me is the mass of the electron, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nThe values of these constants are:\n\nε0 = 8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m (Farads per meter)\nħ = 1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s (Joule-seconds)\nme = 9.109 x 10⁻³¹ kg (kilograms)\ne = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C (Coulombs)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\na0 = (4π(8.854 x 10⁻¹²)(1.055 x 10⁻³⁴)²) / ((9.109 x 10⁻³¹)(1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹)²)\n\na0 ≈ 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ meters."
