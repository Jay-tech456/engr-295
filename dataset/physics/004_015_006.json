    "message_2": "The most widely accepted theory for the existence of dark matter is the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, which is based on the General Theory of Relativity. The CDM model posits that dark matter is composed of non-baryonic, slow-moving particles that do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making them invisible to our telescopes. These particles are referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).\n\nThe CDM model is consistent with the General Theory of Relativity, as it explains the observed gravitational effects in galaxies and larger-scale structures in the universe. According to the model, dark matter particles clump together under the influence of gravity, forming a \"halo\" around galaxies. This halo provides additional gravitational force, which is necessary to explain the observed motion of stars and gas in galaxies.\n\nIn particular, the CDM model helps to resolve the \"galaxy rotation problem.\" Observations of spiral galaxies show that stars and gas in their outer regions are moving at velocities that should be too high to be gravitationally bound to the galaxy, according to the visible mass distribution. The presence of a dark matter halo provides the additional mass and gravitational force needed to explain these high velocities.\n\nFurthermore, the CDM model is consistent with the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe. Dark matter acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that holds these structures together and influences their formation and evolution. The model also successfully predicts the observed patterns in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang.\n\nDespite the success of the CDM model in explaining various observations, the exact nature and properties of dark matter particles remain unknown. Numerous experiments are currently underway to directly detect dark matter particles or to find indirect evidence of their existence through their effects on other particles."
