    "message_1": "A physics student wants to study the reflection of light at a certain angle from the surface of a material. Using Brewster's Law, calculate the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized for a glass surface with an index of refraction of 1.52.",
    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized is related to the index of refraction of the material. The formula for Brewster's angle (θ_B) is:\n\nθ_B = arctan(n)\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction of the material and θ_B is the Brewster's angle.\n\nFor a glass surface with an index of refraction of 1.52, we can calculate the Brewster's angle as follows:\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.52)\n\nθ_B ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized for a glass surface with an index of refraction of 1.52 is approximately 56.31 degrees."
