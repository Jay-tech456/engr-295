    "message_2": "The interaction between a black hole and a nearby star can significantly affect the movement and trajectory of the star, depending on the distance between them and their respective masses. This interaction is primarily governed by the force of gravity.\n\nWhen a star is in the vicinity of a black hole, the gravitational force from the black hole pulls the star towards it. The star's trajectory will be altered as it moves in response to this gravitational attraction. If the star is far enough away from the black hole, it may simply be deflected and continue on a different path. However, if the star is close enough, it can become gravitationally bound to the black hole and start orbiting around it.\n\nIn some cases, the star may enter a stable orbit around the black hole, similar to how planets orbit around stars. However, if the star's orbit is not stable or if it loses energy due to various processes (such as gravitational radiation or interactions with other nearby objects), it may gradually spiral inwards towards the black hole.\n\nAs the star gets closer to the black hole, tidal forces become more significant. These forces arise due to the difference in gravitational pull on the near and far sides of the star. The side of the star closer to the black hole experiences a stronger gravitational pull than the side farther away, stretching the star and potentially causing it to become elongated or distorted.\n\nIf the star gets close enough to the black hole, it may reach a point known as the Roche limit, where the tidal forces become so strong that they overcome the star's self-gravity. At this point, the star can be torn apart, and its material will form an accretion disk around the black hole. The black hole will then gradually absorb the star's material as it falls into the event horizon.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between a black hole and a nearby star can significantly affect the star's movement and trajectory, potentially leading to the star being absorbed by the black hole if it gets close enough and experiences strong tidal forces. The specific outcome depends on factors such as the distance between the two objects, their masses, and the stability of the star's orbit."
