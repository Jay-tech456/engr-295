    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by the generator at a distance of 5 cm from its center, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a small segment of a current-carrying wire of length dl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment, r is the position vector from the segment to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the generator is 2 meters long, we can assume it is a straight wire for simplicity. Let's consider the wire to be along the x-axis, with the center at the origin. The point P is at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the center, so its coordinates are (0, 0.05) in the xy-plane.\n\nWe can break the wire into small segments and integrate the magnetic field produced by each segment. The magnetic field produced by the entire wire at point P will be the sum of the magnetic fields produced by all the small segments.\n\nLet's consider a small segment of length dx at a distance x from the center of the wire. The position vector r from the segment to point P is:\n\nr = (0 - x)i + (0.05 - 0)j = -xi + 0.05j\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + 0.05^2)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field produced by the segment at point P is perpendicular to both the segment and the position vector r. Since the segment is along the x-axis, its direction is given by the unit vector i. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field is given by the cross product of i and r:\n\ndl x r = i x (-xi + 0.05j) = -0.05k\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the Biot-Savart law and integrate over the length of the wire:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dx * (-0.05k)) / (4π * (x^2 + 0.05^2)^(3/2))\n\nThe limits of integration are from -1 m to 1 m, as the wire is 2 meters long and centered at the origin:\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dx / (x^2 + 0.05^2)^(3/2)) from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the substitution method. Let's substitute:\n\nu = x^2 + 0.05^2\ndu = 2x dx\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(du / (2u^(3/2))) from u(-1) to u(1)\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [-1/u^(1/2)] from u(-1) to u(1)\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [-1/sqrt(1^2 + 0.05^2) + 1/sqrt((-1)^2 + 0.05^2)]\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [-1/sqrt(1.0025) + 1/sqrt(1.0025)]\n\nB = -0.05k * (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (2/sqrt(1.0025))\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of μ₀ and I:\n\nB = -0.05k * (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A / 4π) * (2/sqrt(1.0025))\n\nB = -0.05k * (10^(-6) T) * (2/sqrt(1.0025))\n\nB ≈ -0.05k * (10^(-6) T) * (2/1.00125)\n\nB ≈ -0.1k * 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the generator at a distance of 5 cm from its center is approximately 0.1 μT, and the direction is in the negative z-axis (into the plane)."
