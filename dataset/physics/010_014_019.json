    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft with a Mach number of 2.5 is flying at an altitude of 10 km above sea level. If the aircraft encounters a shock wave in its flight path, calculate the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave assuming adiabatic flow. The ambient temperature at the flight altitude is 220 K and the air molecular weight is 28.96 g/mol. (Assume a perfect gas behavior)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave, we will use the normal shock wave relations for a perfect gas. The specific heat ratio (γ) for air is approximately 1.4.\n\n1. The relation between the Mach number (M1) before the shock wave and the Mach number (M2) after the shock wave is given by:\n\nM2^2 = [(M1^2 + 2) / (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1))]\n\n2. The relation between the pressure ratio (P2/P1) and the Mach number before the shock wave (M1) is given by:\n\nP2/P1 = [1 + (2 * γ) / (γ + 1) * (M1^2 - 1)]\n\n3. The relation between the temperature ratio (T2/T1) and the Mach number before the shock wave (M1) is given by:\n\nT2/T1 = P2/P1 * (2 + (γ - 1) * M1^2) / ((γ + 1) * M1^2)\n\nGiven the Mach number M1 = 2.5 and the ambient temperature T1 = 220 K, we can calculate the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave.\n\n1. Calculate M2:\n\nM2^2 = [(2.5^2 + 2) / (2 * 1.4 * 2.5^2 - (1.4 - 1))]\nM2^2 = 0.5773\nM2 = 0.76 (approximately)\n\n2. Calculate the pressure ratio P2/P1:\n\nP2/P1 = [1 + (2 * 1.4) / (1.4 + 1) * (2.5^2 - 1)]\nP2/P1 = 5.418 (approximately)\n\n3. Calculate the temperature ratio T2/T1:\n\nT2/T1 = 5.418 * (2 + (1.4 - 1) * 2.5^2) / ((1.4 + 1) * 2.5^2)\nT2/T1 = 1.687 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave:\n\nT2 = T1 * T2/T1 = 220 K * 1.687 = 371 K (approximately)\n\nTo calculate the pressure behind the shock wave, we need to know the ambient pressure at 10 km altitude. The standard atmospheric pressure at 10 km is approximately 26.5 kPa.\n\nP1 = 26.5 kPa\nP2 = P1 * P2/P1 = 26.5 kPa * 5.418 = 143.6 kPa (approximately)\n\nSo, the temperature behind the shock wave is approximately 371 K, and the pressure is approximately 143.6 kPa."
