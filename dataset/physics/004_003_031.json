Specifically, calculate and compare the trajectories of a spacecraft around a non-rotating black hole and a rotating black hole, given their respective masses and angular momenta.",
    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime around a massive object like a black hole affects the trajectory of a spacecraft due to the warping of spacetime caused by the mass of the black hole. This warping causes the spacecraft to follow a curved path, known as a geodesic, around the black hole. The trajectory of a spacecraft around a black hole can be described using the general theory of relativity.\n\nFor a non-rotating black hole (Schwarzschild black hole), the spacetime metric is given by the Schwarzschild metric. The trajectory of a spacecraft around a Schwarzschild black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild equation:\n\nds^2 = -(1 - 2GM/c^2r)dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/c^2r)^(-1)dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2θ dφ^2)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and r, θ, and φ are the spherical coordinates of the spacecraft.\n\nFor a rotating black hole (Kerr black hole), the spacetime metric is given by the Kerr metric. The trajectory of a spacecraft around a Kerr black hole can be calculated using the Kerr equation:\n\nds^2 = -(1 - 2GM/c^2r + GJ^2/c^4r^2)dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/c^2r + GJ^2/c^4r^2)^(-1)dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2θ dφ^2) + 4GJ/c^2r sin^2θ dφ dt\n\nWhere J is the angular momentum of the black hole.\n\nTo compare the trajectories of a spacecraft around a non-rotating and a rotating black hole, one would need to solve the geodesic equations for both cases, which are derived from the respective metrics. These equations are highly complex and typically require numerical methods to solve.\n\nIn general, the trajectory of a spacecraft around a rotating black hole will be affected not only by the mass of the black hole but also by its angular momentum. This can lead to phenomena such as frame-dragging, where the rotation of the black hole drags the surrounding spacetime, causing the spacecraft's orbit to precess. The precession of the orbit will be more pronounced for a rotating black hole compared to a non-rotating black hole."
