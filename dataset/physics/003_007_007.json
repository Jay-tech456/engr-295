    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the rod, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length element of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is flowing perpendicular to the rod, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the rod. The point where we want to find the magnetic field is 10 cm away from the rod, so we can consider it to be on the same plane as the rod.\n\nLet's integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the rod to find the total magnetic field at the point 10 cm away from the rod.\n\nB = ∫dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³\n\nTo make the integration easier, let's use polar coordinates. Let the angle between the rod and the point be θ, and let the distance from the point to the infinitesimal length element dl be R. Then, r = R * sin(θ) and dl = R * dθ.\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(R * dθ * sin(θ)) / R³\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π (since the rod is straight and we are considering the entire length of the rod). The current I and the distance R are constants, so we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / (4π * R²)) * ∫(sin(θ) * dθ)\n\nNow, we integrate sin(θ) with respect to θ:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / (4π * R²)) * (-cos(θ)) | from 0 to π\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / (4π * R²)) * (cos(0) - cos(π))\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / (4π * R²)) * (1 + 1)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / (2 * R²))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and R:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * (0.1 m)²)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm²) / (0.01 m²)\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-4) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10 cm away from the rod is 2 × 10^(-4) T (Tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current (perpendicular to the rod), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the rod, with the direction depending on the orientation of the current."
