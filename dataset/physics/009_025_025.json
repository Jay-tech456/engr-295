If the index of refraction of the core is 1.517 and the index of refraction of the cladding is 1.512, what is the critical angle at which the light is totally internally reflected?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection in a fiber optic cable, we can use Snell's Law. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Snell's Law is given by:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90 degrees, so sin(θ2) = 1. We can rearrange Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle (θc):\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nGiven the index of refraction of the core (n1) is 1.517 and the index of refraction of the cladding (n2) is 1.512, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nsin(θc) = 1.512 / 1.517\n\nsin(θc) ≈ 0.9967\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθc = arcsin(0.9967)\n\nθc ≈ 81.6 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle at which light is totally internally reflected in this fiber optic cable is approximately 81.6 degrees."
