    "message_2": "The temperature of the universe, as inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K). This value has been measured with high precision by various satellite missions, such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck.\n\nThe observed temperature of the CMB has significant implications for our understanding of the Big Bang model. First, the existence of the CMB itself is a strong piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, as it is the remnant radiation from the early, hot, and dense state of the universe. The temperature of the CMB is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang model, which posits that the universe has cooled down as it expanded over time.\n\nSecond, the nearly uniform temperature of the CMB across the sky (with tiny fluctuations at the level of about 1 part in 100,000) indicates that the early universe was in a state of thermal equilibrium. This supports the idea of cosmic inflation, a rapid expansion of the universe that occurred shortly after the Big Bang, which would have smoothed out any initial inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter and energy.\n\nLastly, the precise measurements of the CMB temperature and its fluctuations have allowed cosmologists to determine various parameters of the universe, such as its age, geometry, and composition. These measurements have confirmed that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, spatially flat, and composed mainly of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter in specific proportions. This information has helped refine and constrain the Big Bang model, making it the leading scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe."
