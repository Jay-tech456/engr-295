    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at a given temperature to its enthalpy of vaporization and is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2 respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) at 25°C (298.15 K) as 40.7 kJ/mol. To use the equation, we need to convert this value to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 40700 J/mol\n\nWe also need the vapor pressure of water at a known temperature. The vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) is 101325 Pa (1 atm). We can use this as our reference point (P1 and T1):\n\nP1 = 101325 Pa\nT1 = 373.15 K\n\nNow we can solve for the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (298.15 K):\n\nT2 = 298.15 K\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nln(P2/101325) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp(-(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K))\nP2 ≈ 3169.6 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is approximately 3169.6 Pa."
