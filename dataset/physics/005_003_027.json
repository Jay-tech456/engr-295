    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity between the two spaceships according to an observer on Earth, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is:\n\nV_rel = (V1 + V2) / (1 + (V1 * V2) / c^2)\n\nwhere V1 and V2 are the velocities of the two spaceships relative to Earth, c is the speed of light, and V_rel is the relative velocity between the two spaceships.\n\nIn this case, V1 = 0.9c and V2 = -0.9c (since the second spaceship is traveling in the opposite direction).\n\nV_rel = (0.9c - 0.9c) / (1 + (0.9c * -0.9c) / c^2)\nV_rel = (0 - 0.81c^2) / (1 + 0.81)\nV_rel = -0.81c^2 / 1.81\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nV_rel = -0.81c^2 / 1.81\nV_rel = -0.81c / 1.81 * c\nV_rel = -0.81 / 1.81 * c\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relative velocity:\n\nV_rel â‰ˆ -0.4475 * c\n\nSo, the relative velocity between the two spaceships according to an observer on Earth is approximately -0.4475c. The negative sign indicates that the spaceships are moving away from each other."
