    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of observing a transition of a muon neutrino to an electron neutrino in a beam of neutrinos after traveling a distance of 730 km through the Earth's crust, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability in a three-flavor scenario:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ13) * sin²(θ23) * sin²(Δm²31 * L / 4E)\n\nHere, θ13 and θ23 are the mixing angles, Δm²31 is the mass difference between the third and first neutrino mass eigenstates, L is the distance traveled (730 km), and E is the energy of the neutrino.\n\nAssuming that the mixing angles and the mass differences between those flavors are known, we can plug in the values to calculate the probability. However, since the energy of the neutrino is not provided, we cannot give a specific probability value. The probability will depend on the energy of the neutrino, as well as the known values of the mixing angles and mass differences."
