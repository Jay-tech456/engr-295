    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from various sources in the universe, such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and other energetic astrophysical processes. When these cosmic rays enter the solar system, they interact with the solar magnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which is carried by the solar wind.\n\nThe interaction between cosmic rays and the solar magnetic field can lead to several effects:\n\n1. Modulation of cosmic rays: The solar magnetic field and the IMF can modulate the intensity of cosmic rays reaching the inner solar system. During periods of high solar activity, the magnetic field is stronger and more turbulent, which can scatter and deflect cosmic rays, reducing their intensity near the Earth and other planets. Conversely, during periods of low solar activity, the magnetic field is weaker, allowing more cosmic rays to penetrate the inner solar system.\n\n2. Forbush decreases: When the Sun emits a strong burst of solar wind, such as during a coronal mass ejection (CME), it can cause a temporary decrease in the intensity of cosmic rays, known as a Forbush decrease. This is due to the enhanced magnetic field associated with the CME, which can deflect and scatter cosmic rays more effectively.\n\n3. Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux variations: Over long timescales, the solar magnetic field can also influence the flux of galactic cosmic rays entering the solar system. This is because the Sun's magnetic field strength and polarity change over the course of the 11-year solar cycle, which can affect the efficiency with which cosmic rays are modulated.\n\nAs for the impact of cosmic rays on the stability and evolution of planetary orbits, the effects are generally negligible. The primary forces governing the motion of planets in the solar system are gravity and, to a much lesser extent, the pressure exerted by the solar radiation. While cosmic rays can interact with the solar magnetic field and the IMF, their influence on the overall structure and dynamics of the solar system's magnetic field is minimal compared to the dominant effects of the solar wind and the Sun's magnetic field itself.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays can affect the solar magnetic field and the IMF through modulation, Forbush decreases, and GCR flux variations, but their impact on the stability and evolution of planetary orbits is negligible. The primary forces governing planetary motion are gravity and solar radiation pressure, with the solar magnetic field playing a much more significant role in shaping the solar system's environment."
