    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 5000 lines per centimeter. If light is incident normally on this grating with a wavelength of 600 nm, what would be the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the maximum (in this case, n = 3 for the third order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light (600 nm), d is the distance between the lines on the grating, and θ is the angle between the central maximum and the maximum of interest.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating. Since there are 5000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 5000 lines per centimeter = 1 / (5000 * 10^2) meters = 2 * 10^(-6) meters\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the grating equation:\n\n3 * (600 * 10^(-9) m) = (2 * 10^(-6) m) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (3 * (600 * 10^(-9) m)) / (2 * 10^(-6) m) = 0.9\n\nθ = arcsin(0.9)\n\nθ ≈ 64.16 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum is approximately 64.16 degrees."
