    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole affects the bending of light and produces gravitational lensing effects due to its immense gravitational pull. According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, massive objects like black holes cause a distortion in the fabric of spacetime. This distortion affects the path of light, causing it to bend around the massive object.\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when a massive object, such as a black hole, lies between a light source and an observer. The gravitational field of the black hole bends the light from the source, causing it to follow a curved path. This bending of light can result in multiple images of the source, magnification, or even a complete ring of light around the black hole, known as an Einstein ring.\n\nThere are several observational evidences that support the phenomenon of gravitational lensing caused by black holes:\n\n1. Quasar lensing: Quasars are extremely bright and distant objects powered by supermassive black holes. In some cases, a massive galaxy or a cluster of galaxies lies between the quasar and Earth, causing the light from the quasar to bend and form multiple images. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous cases, such as the famous \"Twin Quasar\" (Q0957+561) discovered in 1979.\n\n2. Galaxy cluster lensing: Galaxy clusters are massive structures containing hundreds or thousands of galaxies, along with large amounts of dark matter. The combined mass of these objects can cause significant gravitational lensing, distorting the images of background galaxies. One famous example is the \"Bullet Cluster\" (1E 0657-56), where the lensing effect has been used to map the distribution of dark matter in the cluster.\n\n3. Microlensing: This phenomenon occurs when a smaller, closer object, such as a star or a stellar-mass black hole, passes in front of a more distant star. The gravitational field of the closer object bends the light from the background star, causing a temporary brightening of its light. Microlensing events have been observed in several cases, and they provide valuable information about the distribution of dark matter and the presence of black holes in our galaxy.\n\n4. Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image: In 2019, the EHT collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole's shadow, located at the center of the galaxy M87. The image shows a bright ring of light surrounding the black hole, which is the result of gravitational lensing and the bending of light around the event horizon.\n\nThese observations provide strong evidence for the bending of light and gravitational lensing effects caused by black holes and other massive objects, supporting the predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity."
