    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔU/c^2\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔU is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 meters per second).\n\nWe are given the gravitational potential difference ΔU = 6.3 × 10^-10 J/kg. We can now calculate the gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.3 × 10^-10 J/kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.3 × 10^-10 J/kg) / (9.0 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nΔλ/λ = 7.0 × 10^-27\n\nThis is the fractional change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift. To find the actual change in wavelength, we would need to know the initial wavelength of the photon. However, we have found the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon emitted from a height of 500 meters above the Earth's surface, which is 7.0 × 10^-27."
