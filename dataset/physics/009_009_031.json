    "message_2": "To find the focal length of the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nSince the image is twice the distance from the mirror as the object, we can write v = 2u.\n\nNow, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nSince the image height is 3 cm, and we don't have any information about the object height, we can assume the object height to be h. Therefore, the magnification M = (image height) / (object height) = 3/h.\n\nNow, substituting v = 2u in the magnification formula:\n\nM = -(2u)/u = -2\n\nSo, the magnification is -2, which means the image is 2 times larger than the object and inverted. Since M = 3/h, we can write:\n\n-2 = 3/h\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh = -3/2\n\nNow, we can substitute v = 2u in the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/(2u)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2u, we get:\n\n2u = f + 2f\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2u = 3f\n\nNow, we can use the magnification formula again:\n\n-2 = (-3u) / (2u)\n\nSolving for u, we get:\n\nu = -3/2\n\nSubstituting u back into the equation 2u = 3f, we get:\n\n2(-3/2) = 3f\n\nSolving for f, we get:\n\nf = -1\n\nSo, the focal length of the concave mirror is -1 cm. The negative sign indicates that it is a concave mirror, as expected."
