    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the formula for the characteristic strain amplitude (h_c) of the gravitational waves:\n\nh_c = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * f^2) / (c^4 * r * d)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg)\n- f is the frequency of the orbit (in Hz)\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)\n- r is the separation distance between the black holes (in meters)\n- d is the distance from the observer to the system (we will assume it is the same as the separation distance for simplicity)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses from solar masses to kg:\n1 solar mass = 1.9885 × 10^30 kg\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 5.9655 × 10^31 kg\nM2 = 20 solar masses = 20 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 3.9770 × 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the separation distance from km to meters:\n1000 km = 1000 * 1000 m = 1.0 × 10^6 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nh_c = (4 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^2 * (5.9655 × 10^31 kg) * (3.9770 × 10^31 kg) * (100 Hz)^2) / ((2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * (1.0 × 10^6 m) * (1.0 × 10^6 m))\n\nh_c ≈ 1.16 × 10^-21\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system is approximately 1.16 × 10^-21."
