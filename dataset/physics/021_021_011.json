    "message_2": "The missing matter in the universe, also known as dark matter, is a significant component of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is estimated to make up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content, while ordinary matter (including stars, planets, and gas) makes up only about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy.\n\nBlack holes have been considered as a potential source of dark matter. However, current observational data and theoretical models suggest that black holes cannot account for a significant portion of the dark matter in the universe.\n\nOne reason is that black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars, which are made of ordinary matter. The total mass of black holes in the universe is estimated to be much less than the total mass of dark matter. Additionally, the distribution of black holes in galaxies does not match the distribution of dark matter, which is more spread out and forms a halo around galaxies.\n\nMoreover, black holes have a gravitational influence on their surroundings, which can be observed through the motion of nearby stars and gas. If black holes were a major component of dark matter, their gravitational effects would be more prominent in the observed motion of celestial objects.\n\nFurthermore, the recent detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes by the LIGO and Virgo observatories has provided constraints on the abundance of black holes in the universe. These observations suggest that black holes can only account for a small fraction of the total dark matter content.\n\nIn conclusion, while black holes may contribute to the overall mass of the universe, they cannot account for a significant portion of the missing matter or dark matter. The search for the true nature of dark matter continues, with candidates such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions being the focus of ongoing research."
