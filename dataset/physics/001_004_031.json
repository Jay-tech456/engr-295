    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n = 1) to the n = 4 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = (-13.6 eV / n_final^2) - (-13.6 eV / n_initial^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E_final is the energy of the final state (n = 4), E_initial is the energy of the initial state (n = 1), and n_final and n_initial are the principal quantum numbers of the final and initial states, respectively.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 4^2) - (-13.6 eV / 1^2)\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 16) - (-13.6 eV)\nΔE = -0.85 eV + 13.6 eV\nΔE = 12.75 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state to the n = 4 energy level is 12.75 electron volts (eV)."
