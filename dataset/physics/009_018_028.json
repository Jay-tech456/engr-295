    "message_1": "What is the distance between two slits in a double-slit experiment if the distance between the screen and the slits is 1 meter and the second-order bright fringe is observed at an angle of 30 degrees? (Assume the wavelength of light used is 500 nm.)",
    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the distance between the bright fringes on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (in this case, the second-order bright fringe, so m = 2), and λ is the wavelength of the light used.\n\nGiven the distance between the screen and the slits (L) is 1 meter, the angle of the second-order bright fringe (θ) is 30 degrees, and the wavelength of the light used (λ) is 500 nm (5 * 10^-7 meters), we can solve for the distance between the two slits (d).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nd * sin(π / 6) = 2 * (5 * 10^-7)\n\nd * (1/2) = 10 * 10^-7\n\nd = 20 * 10^-7 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit experiment is 2 * 10^-6 meters or 2 micrometers."
