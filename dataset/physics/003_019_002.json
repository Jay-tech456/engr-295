    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor with a radius of 0.5 mm and an outer conductor with a radius of 5 mm. If the current carried by the cable is 10 A, what is the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm from the center of the cable?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nIn this case, we have a coaxial cable with an inner conductor of radius 0.5 mm and an outer conductor of radius 5 mm. The distance at which we want to find the magnetic field is 2 mm from the center, which is within the region between the inner and outer conductors.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given distances to meters:\nInner conductor radius (r₁): 0.5 mm = 0.0005 m\nOuter conductor radius (r₂): 5 mm = 0.005 m\nDistance from the center (r): 2 mm = 0.002 m\n\nSince the distance (r) is between the inner and outer conductors, we only need to consider the current carried by the inner conductor, which is 10 A.\n\nNow, let's apply Ampere's Law. For a coaxial cable, the magnetic field (B) is in the form of concentric circles around the inner conductor. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (0.002 m) as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is constant along this loop, so the line integral simplifies to:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I\n\nWe need to solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2π * 0.002 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.002 m)\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T) / 0.004 m\n\nB = 1 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm from the center of the cable is 1 × 10^(-3) T or 1 mT."
