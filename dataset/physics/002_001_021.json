    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas in an isothermal process, we can use the formula:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nHowever, we are not given the pressure in the problem. To find the pressure, we can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant (8.31 J/mol K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant at 300 K. We can set up a proportion using the initial and final volumes:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nSince the pressure is constant, P1 = P2, and we can simplify the equation:\n\nV1 = V2\n\nNow we can plug in the given volumes:\n\n8 L = 12 L\n\nSince the volumes are equal, the pressure remains constant throughout the process. Now we can calculate the work done using the formula:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nWe know that ΔV = V2 - V1 = 12 L - 8 L = 4 L. However, we still need to find the pressure. We can use the ideal gas law to find the pressure:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWe don't have the number of moles (n), but since the process is isothermal and the pressure is constant, we can assume that the number of moles remains constant as well. Therefore, we can set up another proportion using the initial and final volumes:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nSince P1 = P2, we can simplify the equation:\n\nP * V1 = P * V2\n\nNow we can plug in the given volumes:\n\nP * 8 L = P * 12 L\n\nSince the pressure is constant, we can divide both sides of the equation by the pressure:\n\n8 L = 12 L\n\nThis equation is not correct, as we have already established that V1 and V2 are different. It seems we made an error in our assumptions. We cannot determine the work done by the gas without knowing the pressure or the number of moles of gas in the system. We need more information to solve this problem."
