    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point. This is due to the difference in focal lengths for rays passing through the lens near the edge compared to those passing through the center. To calculate the spherical aberration, we need to find the difference in focal lengths for paraxial rays (rays close to the optical axis) and marginal rays (rays near the edge of the lens).\n\nFirst, let's find the refractive index (n) of the lens using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since the lens is convex, R1 is positive and R2 is negative. Given the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the radius of curvature (R) is 40 cm, we have:\n\n1/20 = (n - 1) * (1/40 - 1/(-40))\n\n1/20 = (n - 1) * (1/20)\n\nn = 2\n\nNow, let's find the focal length for the marginal rays. We can use the formula for the focal length of a lens with a small aperture (approximation for marginal rays):\n\nf_m = R / (2 * (n - 1))\n\nf_m = 40 / (2 * (2 - 1))\n\nf_m = 40 / 2\n\nf_m = 20 cm\n\nSince the focal length for the marginal rays is the same as the focal length for the paraxial rays, there is no spherical aberration for this lens. The spherical aberration is 0."
