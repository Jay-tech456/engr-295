    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole affects the path of light due to its strong gravitational field. According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, massive objects like black holes can curve spacetime around them. When light from a distant object, such as a star, passes close to a black hole, its path gets bent due to the curvature of spacetime. This bending of light is known as gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing can cause multiple images of the same object to appear in the sky, or it can create arcs or rings of light around the black hole, known as Einstein rings. The degree of distortion depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole, the light source, and the observer.\n\nTo calculate the distortion of light caused by a black hole's gravitational field, we can use the formula for the deflection angle (α) of light:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- α is the deflection angle\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance the light would pass the black hole if it were not deflected\n\nThis formula is derived from the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations for the spacetime geometry around a spherically symmetric mass like a black hole. Note that this formula is an approximation and assumes that the light's path is only slightly bent. For stronger gravitational fields or closer distances to the black hole, more complex calculations are required."
