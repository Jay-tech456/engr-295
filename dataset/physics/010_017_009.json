    "message_1": "A steel bridge deck is 20 meters long and is supported by two pillars 15 meters apart. A river flows under the bridge with a velocity of 5 meters per second. If the bridge deck has a natural frequency of vibration of 2 Hertz, what is the amplitude of the bridge deck's vibration due to the fluid-structure interaction with the flowing river? (Assume the bridge deck is rigid and neglect any damping effects.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the bridge deck's vibration due to the fluid-structure interaction with the flowing river, we need to consider the Strouhal number (St), which is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillatory behavior of a flow around a bluff body (such as the bridge deck).\n\nThe Strouhal number is given by:\n\nSt = (f * L) / V\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the oscillation (in this case, the natural frequency of the bridge deck), L is the characteristic length (in this case, the distance between the pillars), and V is the flow velocity (the river's velocity).\n\nWe are given:\nf = 2 Hz\nL = 15 meters\nV = 5 meters/second\n\nPlugging these values into the Strouhal number equation:\n\nSt = (2 * 15) / 5\nSt = 30 / 5\nSt = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude of the vibration. The amplitude of the vibration is related to the Strouhal number, the flow velocity, and the natural frequency of the bridge deck. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\nA = (St * V) / (2 * π * f)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA = (6 * 5) / (2 * π * 2)\nA = 30 / (4 * π)\nA = 30 / (12.566)\nA ≈ 2.39 meters\n\nSo, the amplitude of the bridge deck's vibration due to the fluid-structure interaction with the flowing river is approximately 2.39 meters."
