    "message_2": "Yield stress fluids and viscoplastic fluids are both types of non-Newtonian fluids, meaning their viscosity changes with the applied shear stress or shear rate. The main difference between these two types of fluids lies in their response to external forces.\n\nYield stress fluids are fluids that exhibit a minimum stress threshold, called the yield stress, that must be exceeded before they begin to flow. Below this threshold, the fluid behaves like a solid, and above it, the fluid flows like a liquid. Examples of yield stress fluids include toothpaste, mayonnaise, and ketchup. When you squeeze a tube of toothpaste, you apply enough stress to overcome the yield stress, causing the toothpaste to flow. When the stress is removed, the toothpaste stops flowing and retains its shape.\n\nViscoplastic fluids, on the other hand, are a broader category of non-Newtonian fluids that exhibit both viscous and plastic behavior. Yield stress fluids are a subset of viscoplastic fluids. Viscoplastic fluids can exhibit a range of behaviors, such as shear thinning (where viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate) or shear thickening (where viscosity increases with increasing shear rate). Examples of viscoplastic fluids include paint, blood, and some polymer solutions.\n\nIn contrast, Newtonian fluids have a constant viscosity that does not change with the applied shear stress or shear rate. Examples of Newtonian fluids include water, air, and simple oils. When subjected to external forces, Newtonian fluids flow predictably and their behavior can be described by Newton's law of viscosity, which states that the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate.\n\nThe behavior of yield stress fluids and viscoplastic fluids differs from Newtonian fluids in several ways:\n\n1. Non-linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate: While Newtonian fluids exhibit a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate, yield stress fluids and viscoplastic fluids show a non-linear relationship. This means that their viscosity changes with the applied shear stress or shear rate.\n\n2. Yield stress: Yield stress fluids have a minimum stress threshold that must be exceeded for the fluid to flow. Newtonian fluids do not have a yield stress and will flow under any applied stress.\n\n3. Thixotropic and rheopectic behavior: Some viscoplastic fluids can exhibit time-dependent behavior, such as thixotropy (where viscosity decreases over time under constant shear) or rheopexy (where viscosity increases over time under constant shear). Newtonian fluids do not exhibit such time-dependent behavior.\n\nIn everyday life and industrial applications, the unique properties of yield stress fluids and viscoplastic fluids can be advantageous. For example, in the food industry, the yield stress of ketchup and mayonnaise allows them to be easily spread on a sandwich without dripping. In the construction industry, concrete is a viscoplastic material that can be easily poured and molded when subjected to shear stress, but hardens and maintains its shape when the stress is removed. In the cosmetic industry, creams and lotions often have viscoplastic properties that allow them to spread easily on the skin and then maintain their shape without dripping or running."
