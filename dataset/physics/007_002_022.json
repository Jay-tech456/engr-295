    "message_2": "To solve for the half-life of a radioactive substance, we can use the first-order decay equation:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere:\nN(t) = the mass of the substance at time t\nN0 = the initial mass of the substance\nλ = the decay constant\nt = time\n\nWe are given the initial mass (N0) as 2 grams, the mass after 500 years (N(t)) as 0.5 grams, and the time (t) as 500 years. We need to find the half-life (T½).\n\nFirst, let's solve for the decay constant (λ) using the given information:\n\n0.5 = 2 * e^(-λ * 500)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n0.25 = e^(-λ * 500)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = -λ * 500\n\nNow, solve for λ:\n\nλ = -ln(0.25) / 500 ≈ 0.0027726\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can find the half-life using the following relationship:\n\nT½ = ln(2) / λ\n\nPlug in the value of λ:\n\nT½ ≈ ln(2) / 0.0027726 ≈ 250 years\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive substance is approximately 250 years."
