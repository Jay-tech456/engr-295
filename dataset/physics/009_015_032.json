    "message_2": "To find the spherical aberration of the mirror, we first need to determine the radius of curvature (R) of the mirror. For a parabolic mirror, the relationship between the focal length (f) and the radius of curvature is:\n\nR = 2f\n\nGiven that the focal length (f) is 30 cm, we can calculate the radius of curvature (R):\n\nR = 2 * 30 cm = 60 cm\n\nNow, let's consider the aperture of the mirror limited to a diameter of 10 cm. The radius of this aperture is 5 cm. We can use the formula for the longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) of a mirror:\n\nLSA = (h^2 * (R - f)) / (2 * R^2)\n\nwhere h is the height of the marginal ray at the aperture (in this case, the radius of the limited aperture, which is 5 cm).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nLSA = (5^2 * (60 - 30)) / (2 * 60^2)\nLSA = (25 * 30) / (2 * 3600)\nLSA = 750 / 7200\nLSA â‰ˆ 0.104 cm\n\nSo, the spherical aberration of the mirror with the aperture limited to a diameter of 10 cm is approximately 0.104 cm."
