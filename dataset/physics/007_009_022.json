    "message_1": "What is the enrichment factor of a sample of Uranium-235 if the initial sample had a concentration of 0.7% and the final enriched sample has a concentration of 3.5%? Assume that the enrichment was done using the gas diffusion method where the Uranium atoms are separated based on their mass difference. (Hint: use the formula for enrichment factor, which is the ratio of the final and initial concentrations.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enrichment factor, we can use the formula:\n\nEnrichment Factor = (Final Concentration) / (Initial Concentration)\n\nGiven the initial concentration of Uranium-235 is 0.7% and the final enriched concentration is 3.5%, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nEnrichment Factor = (3.5) / (0.7)\n\nEnrichment Factor = 5\n\nSo, the enrichment factor of the sample of Uranium-235 is 5."
