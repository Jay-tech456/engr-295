    "message_2": "The gravitational influence of a black hole affects the orbits of nearby celestial bodies, such as stars and planets, by exerting a strong gravitational force on them. This force can lead to a variety of observable consequences, depending on the distance between the black hole and the celestial body, as well as the mass of both objects.\n\n1. Gravitational Attraction: The most direct effect of a black hole's gravity is to pull nearby celestial bodies towards it. This can cause stars and planets to have their orbits altered, making them either more elliptical or more circular, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\n2. Accretion Disk Formation: If a celestial body gets too close to a black hole, the tidal forces can become so strong that they start to tear the object apart. The material from the disrupted object can then form an accretion disk around the black hole, which can emit intense radiation as the material spirals inwards and heats up. This radiation can be observed across various wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays.\n\n3. Gravitational Lensing: The strong gravitational field of a black hole can bend the path of light from more distant objects, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This can lead to the observation of multiple images of a single object or the distortion of the object's shape, depending on the alignment between the observer, the black hole, and the background object.\n\n4. Gravitational Waves: When two black holes or other massive objects orbit each other, they can create ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves. These waves can be detected by specialized observatories, such as LIGO and Virgo, and provide valuable information about the properties of the black holes involved, as well as the nature of gravity itself.\n\n5. Stellar Motion: The motion of stars near a black hole can be significantly affected by its gravitational pull. Observations of these stars can reveal the presence of a black hole, even if it is not directly visible. For example, the motion of stars near the center of our Milky Way galaxy has provided strong evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A*.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational influence of a black hole can have a variety of effects on the orbits of nearby celestial bodies, leading to observable consequences such as accretion disk formation, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and altered stellar motion. These observations can help astronomers study black holes and their properties, as well as gain insights into the fundamental nature of gravity and the universe."
