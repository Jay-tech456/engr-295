    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic energy of an electron, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nwhere E is the relativistic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron.\n\nGiven the velocity of the electron is 0.8c, we can plug in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, let's calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = (1.6667)(9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ (1.6667)(9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg)(9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nE ≈ (1.6667)(8.198445204 × 10^-14 kg m^2/s^2)\nE ≈ 1.366 × 10^-13 J\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the electron is approximately 1.366 × 10^-13 Joules."
