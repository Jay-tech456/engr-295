    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 m from the center of the circular sheet, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed across the sheet, we can simplify the problem by considering the sheet as a series of concentric circular current loops.\n\nLet's consider a small circular loop of radius r and thickness dr within the sheet. The area of this loop is dA = 2πr dr. The current density J (current per unit area) can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / A, where I is the total current (4 A) and A is the area of the sheet (πR^2, R = 0.5 m).\n\nJ = 4 / (π * 0.5^2) = 16 / π A/m^2\n\nThe current flowing through the small circular loop dI can be calculated as:\n\ndI = J * dA = (16 / π) * 2πr dr = 32r dr A\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field dB produced by this small circular loop at a distance z (0.8 m) from the center of the sheet in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the sheet:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πr) / (r^2 + z^2)^(3/2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) T*m/A).\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the entire sheet (from r = 0 to r = R) to find the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(dI * 2πr) / (r^2 + z^2)^(3/2) dr, with limits from 0 to 0.5\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(32r^2 dr) / (r^2 + 0.8^2)^(3/2), with limits from 0 to 0.5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution method. Let x = r^2, then 2r dr = dx. The integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 8π) * ∫(32x dx) / (x + 0.8^2)^(3/2), with limits from 0 to 0.25\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 8π) * [-(32/3) * (x + 0.8^2)^(-1/2)] from 0 to 0.25\n\nB = (μ₀ / 8π) * [-(32/3) * (0.25 + 0.8^2)^(-1/2) - (-(32/3) * (0 + 0.8^2)^(-1/2))]\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) / 8π) * [-(32/3) * (0.25 + 0.64)^(-1/2) + (32/3) * (0.64)^(-1/2)]\n\nB ≈ 0.0000005 * [-32/3 * (0.89)^(-1/2) + 32/3 * (0.64)^(-1/2)]\n\nB ≈ 0.0000005 * [-32/3 * 1.057 + 32/3 * 1.25]\n\nB ≈ 0.0000005 * [32/3 * (1.25 - 1.057)]\n\nB ≈ 0.0000005 * 32/3 * 0.193\n\nB ≈ 2.064 x 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 m from the center of the sheet in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the sheet is approximately 2.064 x 10^(-6) T."
