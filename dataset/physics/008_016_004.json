    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is supported by several lines of indirect evidence, which are primarily based on its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that the mass distribution in galaxies is not consistent with the distribution of visible matter alone. The outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These studies have shown that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, providing further evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of the formation of cosmic structures show that the observed distribution of galaxies can only be explained if dark matter is included in the models.\n\n5. Galaxy cluster dynamics: The motion and distribution of galaxies within galaxy clusters also suggest the presence of dark matter. The total mass of galaxy clusters, as inferred from the motion of galaxies within them, is much greater than the mass of the visible matter in the clusters.\n\nDark matter is different from ordinary matter in several ways:\n\n1. Interaction with electromagnetic radiation: Unlike ordinary matter, dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation. This makes it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2. Particle composition: Ordinary matter is composed of atoms, which are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Dark matter is believed to be composed of some yet-to-be-discovered subatomic particles, which are not part of the standard model of particle physics. Some leading candidates for dark matter particles include Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions.\n\n3. Gravitational effects: Both dark matter and ordinary matter interact through gravity. However, dark matter is thought to interact only weakly, if at all, through other fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces. This is in contrast to ordinary matter, which interacts through all four fundamental forces.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark matter is different from ordinary matter in that it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is likely composed of yet-to-be-discovered particles that interact only through gravity and possibly other weak interactions."
