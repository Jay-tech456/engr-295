    "message_1": "A spaceship is approaching Earth at a speed of 0.8c. If the original frequency of the spaceship's communication signal is 2 GHz, what frequency will a stationary observer on Earth detect? (Assuming there is no gravitational redshift.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency (and wavelength) of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the source of the wave is the spaceship, and the observer is stationary on Earth.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler effect formula is given by:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere:\n- f_observed is the frequency detected by the observer on Earth\n- f_source is the original frequency of the spaceship's communication signal (2 GHz)\n- v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the observer (0.8c)\n- c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 2 GHz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = 2 GHz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_observed = 2 GHz * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = 2 GHz * 3\n\nf_observed = 6 GHz\n\nSo, a stationary observer on Earth will detect a frequency of 6 GHz for the spaceship's communication signal."
