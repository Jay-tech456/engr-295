    "message_2": "To find the difference in wavelength between the incident and scattered photon in the Compton effect, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, λ' is the final wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the scattering angle θ. We can use the electron momentum (p_e) and the initial photon momentum (p_photon) to find the scattering angle. The momentum of the photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\np_photon = h/λ\n\nGiven the initial wavelength λ = 1.0 Å = 1.0 x 10^-10 m, we can find the initial photon momentum:\n\np_photon = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (1.0 x 10^-10 m) = 6.626 x 10^-24 kg m/s\n\nNow, we are given the electron momentum p_e = 1.0 keV/c. To convert this to SI units, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\np_e = (1.0 x 10^3 eV/c) * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.602 x 10^-16 kg m/s\n\nUsing the conservation of momentum, we can find the scattering angle θ:\n\np_photon = p_e * sin(θ)\n\nθ = arcsin(p_photon / p_e) = arcsin((6.626 x 10^-24 kg m/s) / (1.602 x 10^-16 kg m/s)) ≈ 0.0414 radians\n\nNow that we have the scattering angle, we can find the change in wavelength using the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ)) = ((6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / ((9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s))) * (1 - cos(0.0414))\n\nΔλ ≈ 2.43 x 10^-12 m\n\nThe difference in wavelength between the incident and scattered photon is approximately 2.43 x 10^-12 m or 2.43 pm."
