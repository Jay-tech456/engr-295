    "message_1": "What is the vapor pressure at a temperature of 25°C of a liquid that has a heat of vaporization of 40 kJ/mol and a boiling point of 85°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its heat of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively,\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization,\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K),\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given:\nΔHvap = 40 kJ/mol = 40,000 J/mol,\nT1 = 85°C = 85 + 273.15 = 358.15 K (boiling point),\nT2 = 25°C = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K,\nP1 = 1 atm (vapor pressure at boiling point).\n\nWe need to find P2 (vapor pressure at 25°C).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nP2 = 1 atm * exp(-40,000 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol·K * (1/298.15 K - 1/358.15 K))\n\nP2 ≈ 1 atm * exp(6.303)\n\nP2 ≈ 1 atm * 544.6\n\nP2 ≈ 0.001835 atm\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of the liquid at 25°C is approximately 0.001835 atm."
