    "message_2": "In Quantum Field Theory, the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into a muon-antimuon pair at a center-of-mass energy of 10 GeV can be calculated using the Mandelstam variables and the Feynman rules. The process is mediated by a virtual photon or a Z boson. \n\nThe differential cross-section for this process can be expressed as:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2)/(4s) * (1 + cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137), s is the square of the center-of-mass energy (10 GeV)^2, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nTo find the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the full solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫(dσ/dΩ) dΩ\n\nAfter integrating, we get:\n\nσ = (4πα^2)/(3s)\n\nPlugging in the values for α and s, we can calculate the total cross-section:\n\nσ = (4π(1/137)^2)/(3(10^2 GeV^2)) ≈ 0.88 nb (nanobarns)\n\nSo, the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into a muon-antimuon pair at a center-of-mass energy of 10 GeV in Quantum Field Theory is approximately 0.88 nanobarns."
