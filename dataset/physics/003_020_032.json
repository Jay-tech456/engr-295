    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor has a plate separation of 0.02 m and a plate area of 0.05 m². The capacitor is charged to a potential difference of 12 V and then a current of 5 A is passed through it. Find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.01 m from the center of the capacitor.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.01 m from the center of the capacitor, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a parallel plate capacitor, the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire connecting the plates. We can choose a circular loop of radius 0.01 m centered on the wire as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is tangent to the circle at every point, so the dot product B⋅dl reduces to B*dl.\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * ∮dl = B * (2πr)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into Ampere's law:\n\nB * (2πr) = μ₀I\n\nWhere r = 0.01 m, I = 5 A, and μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB * (2π * 0.01) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 5\n\nB * 0.02π = 20π × 10^(-7)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7)) / 0.02π\n\nB ≈ 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.01 m from the center of the capacitor is approximately 10 μT."
