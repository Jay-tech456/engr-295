    "message_2": "To find the saturation magnetization of a ferromagnetic sample of iron, we need to know the magnetic moment per unit volume. For iron, the saturation magnetization (Ms) is approximately 1.7 T (Tesla) at room temperature (around 300K).\n\nNow, we need to find the total magnetic moment of the sample. First, we need to find the volume of the sample:\n\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = (2mm × 2mm × 1mm) = 4 mm³\n\nTo convert the volume to m³, we need to multiply by (1 × 10⁻⁹)³:\n\nVolume = 4 × 10⁻⁹ m³\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic moment (M) of the sample:\n\nM = Ms × Volume\nM = 1.7 T × 4 × 10⁻⁹ m³\nM = 6.8 × 10⁻⁹ T·m³\n\nSo, the saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic sample of iron with dimensions 2mm x 2mm x 1mm at a temperature of 300K is 6.8 × 10⁻⁹ T·m³."
