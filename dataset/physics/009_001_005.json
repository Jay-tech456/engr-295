    "message_2": "To find the angle of incidence, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and water, respectively), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 (air) is approximately 1 (since the refractive index of air is very close to 1), n2 (water) is 1.33, and θ2 is 30 degrees. We want to find θ1.\n\n1 * sin(θ1) = 1.33 * sin(30°)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.33 * sin(30°)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.33 * 0.5 (since sin(30°) = 0.5)\n\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.665\n\nNow, to find θ1, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.665:\n\nθ1 ≈ arcsin(0.665)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.8°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence is approximately 41.8 degrees."
