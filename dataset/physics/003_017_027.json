    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the hexagon loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the distance (d) from the wire to the center of the loop.\n\nFor a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to the midpoint of each side is equal to the side length (0.1 meters) divided by the square root of 3. Therefore, d = 0.1 / sqrt(3).\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value of 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B) for one side of the hexagon and then multiply it by 6 since there are 6 sides in a hexagon.\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * (0.1 / sqrt(3)))\n\nB_side = (8π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1 / sqrt(3))\n\nB_side = (8π × 10^(-6) T·m) * sqrt(3)\n\nNow, we multiply the magnetic field of one side by 6 to get the total magnetic field at the center of the hexagon loop.\n\nB_total = 6 * B_side\n\nB_total = 6 * (8π × 10^(-6) T·m) * sqrt(3)\n\nB_total ≈ 2.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the hexagon loop is approximately 2.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
