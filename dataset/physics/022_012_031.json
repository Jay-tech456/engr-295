    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nDark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (baryonic matter) accounts for only about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nThe role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Initial density fluctuations: In the early universe, there were small density fluctuations in both dark matter and baryonic matter. These fluctuations served as the seeds for the formation of large-scale structures.\n\n2. Gravitational collapse: Due to its gravitational influence, dark matter started to collapse into denser regions, forming the initial dark matter halos. These halos acted as gravitational wells, attracting baryonic matter towards them.\n\n3. Formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters: As baryonic matter fell into the dark matter halos, it began to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. The presence of dark matter provided the necessary gravitational force to hold these structures together, preventing them from dispersing due to their own kinetic energy.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter also influences the gravitational interactions between galaxies and galaxy clusters by causing gravitational lensing. This phenomenon occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object. Gravitational lensing allows us to indirectly observe the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters and provides further evidence for its existence.\n\nIn summary, dark matter plays a vital role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the universe. Its gravitational influence drives the initial collapse of matter into dark matter halos, which in turn serve as the foundation for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Additionally, dark matter's gravitational effects can be observed through phenomena such as gravitational lensing, providing indirect evidence for its existence and distribution in the universe."
