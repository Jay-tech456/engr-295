    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the cross-section for electron-positron (e⁻e⁺) annihilation into two photons (γγ) can be calculated using the Mandelstam variables and the Feynman rules. The cross-section formula for this process is given by:\n\nσ(e⁻e⁺ → γγ) = (4πα²)/(3s),\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137), and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\nGiven the center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV, we can calculate the cross-section:\n\n1. Convert the center-of-mass energy to natural units (MeV):\nE = 500 GeV × 1000 = 500,000 MeV\n\n2. Calculate the square of the center-of-mass energy (s):\ns = (2 * m_e * E)²\nwhere m_e is the electron mass (approximately 0.511 MeV)\n\ns = (2 * 0.511 MeV * 500,000 MeV)² = (1.022 MeV * 500,000 MeV)² = (511,000 MeV²)² = 2.61121 × 10¹¹ MeV²\n\n3. Calculate the cross-section:\nσ(e⁻e⁺ → γγ) = (4πα²)/(3s) = (4π * (1/137)²) / (3 * 2.61121 × 10¹¹ MeV²)\n\nσ(e⁻e⁺ → γγ) ≈ 6.015 × 10⁻² pb (picobarns)\n\nSo, the cross-section for electron-positron annihilation into two photons in quantum electrodynamics at a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV is approximately 6.015 × 10⁻² picobarns."
