    "message_2": "The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 3 times the mass of the sun, we can write:\n\nM = 3 * M_sun\n\nwhere M_sun is the solar mass, approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nR_s = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s â‰ˆ 8.86 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole with a mass equivalent to 3 times that of the sun is approximately 8.86 x 10^3 meters (8.86 kilometers)."
