    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil with 100 turns and a secondary coil with 50 turns. If the primary coil is carrying a current of 5 A and the transformer has an iron core with a relative permeability of 2000, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the core?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field inside the core, we first need to find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil. We can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil:\n\nB_primary = μ₀ * μr * N_primary * I_primary / L\n\nwhere B_primary is the magnetic field produced by the primary coil, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), μr is the relative permeability of the iron core, N_primary is the number of turns in the primary coil, I_primary is the current in the primary coil, and L is the length of the solenoid.\n\nHowever, we are not given the length of the solenoid (L). Since we are only asked for the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the core, we can assume that the length of the solenoid is constant and does not affect the magnetic field. Therefore, we can find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil as follows:\n\nB_primary = μ₀ * μr * N_primary * I_primary\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nB_primary = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2000 * 100 turns * 5 A\n\nB_primary = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 * 500 A\n\nB_primary ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-3) T * 1000\n\nB_primary ≈ 1.2566 T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the core is approximately 1.2566 T (tesla)."
