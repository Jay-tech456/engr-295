    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from a wire carrying a current of 2 A. The wire is positioned perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the given distance.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from a wire carrying a current of 2 A, we can use Ampere's law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (2 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla).\n\nTo determine the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the direction of the current in the wire."
