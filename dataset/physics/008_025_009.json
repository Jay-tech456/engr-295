    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. The different decay modes of the Higgs boson are determined by the possible final states of particles it can decay into. Some of the most common decay modes are:\n\n1. Higgs boson to bottom quark-antiquark pair (H → bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. The Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark and its corresponding antiquark.\n\n2. Higgs boson to W boson pair (H → WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons, which can be either W+ and W- or a virtual W boson pair, depending on the available energy.\n\n3. Higgs boson to Z boson pair (H → ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons, which can be either on-shell or off-shell (virtual), depending on the available energy.\n\n4. Higgs boson to tau lepton-antilepton pair (H → ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%. The Higgs boson decays into a tau lepton and its corresponding antilepton.\n\n5. Higgs boson to charm quark-antiquark pair (H → cc): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.9%. The Higgs boson decays into a charm quark and its corresponding antiquark.\n\n6. Higgs boson to gluon pair (H → gg): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 8.6%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of gluons through a loop of top quarks or other heavy particles.\n\n7. Higgs boson to photon pair (H → γγ): This is a rare decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 0.2%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of photons through a loop of charged particles, such as W bosons or top quarks.\n\n8. Higgs boson to muon-antimuon pair (H → μμ): This is an extremely rare decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 0.02%. The Higgs boson decays into a muon and its corresponding antimuon.\n\nThe properties of the Higgs boson, such as its mass and spin, remain the same in each decay mode. However, the properties of the final state particles, such as their masses, spins, and charges, depend on the specific decay mode. The different decay modes also have different probabilities of occurring, as indicated by their branching ratios. These probabilities depend on the coupling strengths between the Higgs boson and the final state particles, which are determined by the properties of the particles and the Higgs mechanism."
