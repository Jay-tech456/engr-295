    "message_1": "A diffraction grating with 800 lines per millimeter is illuminated with monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm. What is the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum if the screen is placed at a distance of 1.5 meters from the grating?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 800 lines per millimeter, the distance between the lines is:\n\nd = 1 / 800 lines/mm = 0.00125 mm/line = 1.25 x 10^(-6) m/line\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the angle for the third order maximum (m = 3):\n\n1.25 x 10^(-6) m/line * sin(θ) = 3 * 600 x 10^(-9) m\n\nsin(θ) = (3 * 600 x 10^(-9) m) / (1.25 x 10^(-6) m/line)\n\nsin(θ) = 0.00144\n\nθ = arcsin(0.00144) = 0.0826 radians\n\nNow, we can convert the angle from radians to degrees:\n\nθ = 0.0826 radians * (180°/π) = 4.73°\n\nSo, the angle between the central maximum and the third order maximum is approximately 4.73°."
