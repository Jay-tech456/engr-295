    "message_2": "The expected rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the types of sources being observed, and the current understanding of astrophysical populations. Currently, the main sources of gravitational waves are compact binary coalescences involving neutron stars and black holes.\n\nThe LIGO and Virgo observatories have already made several detections of gravitational waves since 2015. With planned upgrades and improvements in sensitivity, the detection rate is expected to increase significantly. The next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, are expected to have even higher sensitivities, allowing them to detect gravitational waves from a larger volume of the universe.\n\nBased on current models and parameters, the expected detection rates for different types of sources are as follows:\n\n1. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers: The current detection rate is around a few tens per year, and with future improvements in detector sensitivity, this rate could increase to hundreds or even thousands of detections per year.\n\n2. Neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) mergers: The current detection rate is a few per year, and with future improvements, this rate could increase to tens or hundreds of detections per year.\n\n3. Binary black hole (BBH) mergers: The current detection rate is several tens per year, and with future improvements, this rate could increase to hundreds or even thousands of detections per year.\n\nIt is important to note that these estimates are based on current models and understanding of astrophysical populations, which are subject to change as more data is collected and analyzed. Additionally, future observatories may also detect gravitational waves from other sources, such as supernovae, continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, or even signals from the early universe. As the field of gravitational wave astronomy continues to grow, the expected detection rates will likely be refined and updated."
