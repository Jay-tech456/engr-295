    "message_1": "Problem: \nA space station is moving at a velocity of 0.8c relative to the Earth. An astronaut aboard the space station has a clock that ticks at a rate of 1 second per second as seen on the space station. How much time has elapsed on the astronaut's clock when 5 years have elapsed on Earth, according to an observer on the Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time elapsed in the moving frame (the astronaut's clock), Δt is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (Earth), v is the relative velocity between the two frames, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the space station is moving at a velocity of 0.8c relative to Earth, and 5 years have elapsed on Earth, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔt' = (5 years) / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = (5 years) / √(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt' = (5 years) / √(0.36)\n\nΔt' = (5 years) / 0.6\n\nΔt' ≈ 8.33 years\n\nSo, according to an observer on Earth, approximately 8.33 years have elapsed on the astronaut's clock when 5 years have elapsed on Earth."
