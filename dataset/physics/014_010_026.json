    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 1,000,000 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^36 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.989 × 10^36 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^9 meters\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses is approximately 2.95 × 10^9 meters."
