    "message_2": "Dark radiation refers to hypothetical particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter and radiation, similar to how dark matter interacts weakly with ordinary matter. These particles are assumed to be relativistic, meaning they travel at speeds close to the speed of light. Examples of dark radiation candidates include sterile neutrinos and axions.\n\nThe presence of dark radiation could have several implications for our current understanding of the composition and behavior of dark matter in the universe:\n\n1. Altering the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies: The presence of dark radiation could affect the anisotropies in the CMB, which is the relic radiation from the early universe. This could lead to changes in our understanding of the early universe's evolution and the formation of large-scale structures.\n\n2. Changing the expansion rate of the universe: Dark radiation contributes to the overall energy density of the universe. An increased energy density due to dark radiation could lead to a faster expansion rate of the universe, affecting our understanding of the age and size of the universe.\n\n3. Impact on structure formation: The presence of dark radiation could influence the formation of cosmic structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark radiation could either suppress or enhance the growth of these structures, depending on its properties and interactions with dark matter.\n\n4. Modifying the nature of dark matter: If dark radiation particles are discovered to be a significant component of the universe, it could change our understanding of the nature of dark matter itself. For example, if sterile neutrinos are found to be a major component of dark radiation, it could imply that dark matter is composed of a mixture of cold and warm dark matter particles.\n\n5. Constraints on particle physics models: The detection of dark radiation would provide valuable information about the properties of these hypothetical particles, such as their masses and interaction strengths. This could help constrain various particle physics models and potentially point towards new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark radiation could significantly affect our current understanding of the composition and behavior of dark matter in the universe. It could lead to changes in our understanding of the early universe, the expansion rate, structure formation, and the nature of dark matter itself. Additionally, it could provide valuable constraints on particle physics models and potentially reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model."
