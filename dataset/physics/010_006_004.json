    "message_2": "To find the pressure at the bottom of the container, we can use the formula for pressure in a fluid at rest:\n\nP = ρgh\n\nwhere P is the pressure, ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the height of the fluid column.\n\nGiven:\nDensity of water, ρ = 1000 kg/m³\nGravitational acceleration, g = 9.8 m/s²\nHeight of the container, h = 20 cm = 0.2 m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = (1000 kg/m³) × (9.8 m/s²) × (0.2 m)\n\nP = 1960 Pa (Pascals)\n\nSo, the pressure at the bottom of the container is 1960 Pascals."
