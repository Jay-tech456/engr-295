    "message_2": "To calculate the hydrostatic pressure on the bottom of the container, we need to know the height of the water column and the density of the water. The height of the water column is given as 2 meters. The density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³.\n\nHydrostatic pressure (P) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = ρgh\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid (water), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the fluid column.\n\nP = (1000 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)(2 m)\nP = 19620 kg m²/s² m³ = 19620 N/m² = 19620 Pa\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure on the bottom of the container is 19620 Pa (Pascals).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the buoyant force acting on the wooden block. The buoyant force (F_b) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_b = ρ_water * V_displaced * g\n\nwhere ρ_water is the density of water, V_displaced is the volume of water displaced by the wooden block, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the wooden block:\n\nV_block = length * width * height\nV_block = (1 m)(0.5 m)(0.2 m)\nV_block = 0.1 m³\n\nSince the wooden block is floating on the water, it displaces an equal volume of water. Therefore, V_displaced = V_block = 0.1 m³.\n\nNow, we can calculate the buoyant force:\n\nF_b = (1000 kg/m³)(0.1 m³)(9.81 m/s²)\nF_b = 981 kg m²/s² = 981 N\n\nThe buoyant force acting on the wooden block is 981 N (Newtons)."
