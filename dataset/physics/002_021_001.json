    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide in the container, we need to use the following equation:\n\nfugacity (f) = pressure (P) * phi\n\nwhere phi is the fugacity coefficient.\n\nThe fugacity coefficient (phi) can be calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS), which is a widely used equation of state for non-ideal gases. The PR EOS is given by:\n\nP = (R * T) / (V - b) - a / (V^2 + 2 * b * V - b^2)\n\nwhere P is the pressure, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, V is the molar volume, a and b are the Peng-Robinson parameters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Peng-Robinson parameters a and b. They are given by:\n\na = 0.45724 * (R^2 * Tc^2) / Pc\nb = 0.07780 * (R * Tc) / Pc\n\nwhere Tc and Pc are the critical temperature and pressure of carbon dioxide, respectively. For carbon dioxide, Tc = 304.1 K and Pc = 7.38 MPa.\n\nUsing the gas constant R = 8.314 J/(mol*K):\n\na = 0.45724 * (8.314^2 * 304.1^2) / (7.38 * 10^6)\na ≈ 0.3641 m^6 Pa/mol^2\n\nb = 0.07780 * (8.314 * 304.1) / (7.38 * 10^6)\nb ≈ 3.59 * 10^-4 m^3/mol\n\nNow, we need to find the molar volume (V) of carbon dioxide. The number of moles (n) can be calculated using the molar mass of CO2 (44.01 g/mol):\n\nn = mass / molar_mass\nn = 2000 g / 44.01 g/mol\nn ≈ 45.44 mol\n\nThe volume of the container can be calculated using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\nV = nRT / P\nV = (45.44 mol * 8.314 J/(mol*K) * 300 K) / (8 * 10^6 Pa)\nV ≈ 0.0141 m^3\n\nThe molar volume (V) can be calculated by dividing the volume by the number of moles:\n\nV = 0.0141 m^3 / 45.44 mol\nV ≈ 3.10 * 10^-4 m^3/mol\n\nNow, we can solve the PR EOS for the compressibility factor (Z):\n\nZ = (P * V) / (R * T)\n\nZ = (8 * 10^6 Pa * 3.10 * 10^-4 m^3/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol*K) * 300 K)\nZ ≈ 1.01\n\nThe fugacity coefficient (phi) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nphi = exp[(Z - 1) - log(Z - B) - (A / (2 * sqrt(2) * B)) * log((Z + (1 + sqrt(2)) * B) / (Z + (1 - sqrt(2)) * B))]\n\nwhere A and B are dimensionless parameters given by:\n\nA = a * P / (R^2 * T^2)\nB = b * P / (R * T)\n\nA = 0.3641 m^6 Pa/mol^2 * (8 * 10^6 Pa) / (8.314^2 J^2/(mol^2*K^2) * 300^2 K^2)\nA ≈ 0.984\n\nB = 3.59 * 10^-4 m^3/mol * (8 * 10^6 Pa) / (8.314 J/(mol*K) * 300 K)\nB ≈ 0.115\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity coefficient (phi):\n\nphi = exp[(1.01 - 1) - log(1.01 - 0.115) - (0.984 / (2 * sqrt(2) * 0.115)) * log((1.01 + (1 + sqrt(2)) * 0.115) / (1.01 + (1 - sqrt(2)) * 0.115))]\nphi ≈ 0.992\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity (f) of carbon dioxide:\n\nfugacity (f) = pressure (P) * phi\nf = 8 * 10^6 Pa * 0.992\nf ≈ 7.94 * 10^6 Pa\n\nThe fugacity of carbon dioxide in the container is approximately 7.94 MPa."
