    "message_1": "A ray of light is traveling in air (n=1.00) and is incident on a water (n=1.33) surface at an angle of 40 degrees to the normal. Calculate the angle of refraction using Snell's Law.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction using Snell's Law, we can use the formula:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and water in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence (40 degrees), and θ2 is the angle of refraction that we want to find.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1.00 * sin(40°) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(40°) ≈ 0.6428\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.33:\n\n0.6428 / 1.33 ≈ sin(θ2)\n\n0.4833 ≈ sin(θ2)\n\nTo find the angle of refraction θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.4833:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4833)\n\nθ2 ≈ 29.2°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 29.2 degrees."
