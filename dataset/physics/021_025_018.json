    "message_2": "The minimum mass required for a collapsing object to become a primordial black hole is determined by the Schwarzschild radius, which is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor a primordial black hole, the minimum mass is typically considered to be around the Planck mass, which is approximately 2.2 x 10^-8 kg. This mass corresponds to a Schwarzschild radius of about 10^-35 meters. The density required for a collapsing object to become a primordial black hole can be estimated using the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / (4/3 * pi * Rs^3)\n\nFor a primordial black hole with a mass of 2.2 x 10^-8 kg and a Schwarzschild radius of 10^-35 meters, the required density would be on the order of 10^93 kg/m^3.\n\nThe theory of black hole evaporation through Hawking radiation states that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation causes the black hole to lose mass over time, eventually leading to its evaporation. The evaporation time is proportional to the cube of the black hole's mass, so smaller black holes evaporate faster than larger ones.\n\nPrimordial black holes with masses around the Planck mass would have already evaporated due to Hawking radiation since the beginning of the universe. However, primordial black holes with larger masses could still exist and potentially contribute to the dark matter in the universe. The evaporation timescale for these black holes would be much longer, allowing them to persist throughout the age of the universe.\n\nThe possible existence of primordial black holes as a source of dark matter is still an open question in astrophysics. While they could potentially account for some of the dark matter, current observational constraints suggest that they cannot be the dominant source. Further observations and research are needed to determine the role of primordial black holes in the universe's dark matter content."
