    "message_2": "The relationship between the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth and the variability of the Earth's atmospheric electrostatic field is complex and not yet fully understood. However, several studies have shown that there is a correlation between the two phenomena.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. When these particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with atmospheric molecules, creating secondary particles such as electrons, muons, and other charged particles. These secondary particles can ionize the atmosphere, which in turn can influence the Earth's atmospheric electrostatic field.\n\nThe Earth's atmospheric electrostatic field, also known as the global electric circuit, is a natural electrical system that exists between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. It is maintained by thunderstorms, which generate electric currents that flow through the atmosphere. The ionization caused by cosmic rays can affect the conductivity of the atmosphere, which in turn can influence the global electric circuit.\n\nThe relationship between cosmic ray flux and the Earth's atmospheric electrostatic field can be influenced by several factors, including solar activity, geomagnetic activity, and atmospheric conditions. For example, during periods of high solar activity, the solar wind can shield the Earth from cosmic rays, reducing their flux and potentially affecting the atmospheric electrostatic field.\n\nIn summary, there is a relationship between the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth and the variability of the Earth's atmospheric electrostatic field, but the exact nature of this relationship is still an active area of research. The interaction between cosmic rays and the Earth's atmosphere can influence the global electric circuit, but the extent of this influence depends on various factors such as solar and geomagnetic activity, as well as atmospheric conditions."
