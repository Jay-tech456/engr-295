    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil of 200 turns carrying a current of 5 A, and a secondary coil of 800 turns. If the magnetic field at the center of the primary coil is 0.035 T, what is the magnetic field at the center of the secondary coil? Assume both coils are tightly wound and have the same cross-sectional area.",
    "message_2": "In an ideal transformer, the ratio of the number of turns in the primary coil (N1) to the number of turns in the secondary coil (N2) is equal to the ratio of the magnetic field in the primary coil (B1) to the magnetic field in the secondary coil (B2). This can be expressed as:\n\nN1/N2 = B1/B2\n\nGiven the number of turns in the primary coil (N1) is 200, the number of turns in the secondary coil (N2) is 800, and the magnetic field at the center of the primary coil (B1) is 0.035 T, we can solve for the magnetic field at the center of the secondary coil (B2):\n\n200/800 = 0.035/B2\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for B2:\n\nB2 = (800/200) * 0.035\n\nB2 = 4 * 0.035\n\nB2 = 0.14 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the secondary coil is 0.14 T."
