    "message_2": "To determine the neutron diffraction pattern produced by a crystal of copper, we can use Bragg's Law, which relates the angle of diffraction (θ) to the wavelength (λ) of the incident neutron beam and the interplanar spacing (d) of the crystal lattice.\n\nBragg's Law: nλ = 2d sinθ\n\nHere, n is an integer representing the order of diffraction, and θ is the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam.\n\nFirst, we need to find the interplanar spacing (d) for the (1 1 1) plane in the copper crystal. We can use the formula:\n\nd = a / √(h² + k² + l²)\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant of the copper crystal, and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\nFor copper, the lattice constant a = 3.61 Å (angstroms). The Miller indices for the given plane are (1 1 1). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = 3.61 Å / √(1² + 1² + 1²) = 3.61 Å / √3 = 2.08 Å\n\nNow that we have the interplanar spacing, we can use Bragg's Law to find the angle of diffraction (θ). The incident neutron beam has a wavelength of λ = 1.8 Å. Let's solve for θ when n = 1 (first-order diffraction):\n\n1.8 Å = 2 × 2.08 Å × sinθ\n\nSolving for sinθ:\n\nsinθ = 1.8 Å / (2 × 2.08 Å) = 0.4327\n\nNow, find θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.4327) = 25.9°\n\nSo, the angle of diffraction for the first-order diffraction (n = 1) is 25.9°. The neutron diffraction pattern produced by the copper crystal will show a peak at this angle for the (1 1 1) plane. Higher-order diffractions (n > 1) may also be present, but their intensities will generally be weaker."
