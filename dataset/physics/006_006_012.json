    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of a neutral hydrogen atom, we need to consider the interaction between the magnetic moment of the proton (μ_p) and the magnetic moment of the electron (μ_e). This interaction is described by the following formula:\n\nΔE = -μ_p • μ_e • (1/r^3)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two hyperfine levels, and r is the distance between the proton and the electron.\n\nWe can rewrite the magnetic moments in terms of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (γ_e), the Bohr magneton (μ_B), and the nuclear magneton (μ_N):\n\nμ_p = g_p * μ_N\nμ_e = g_e * μ_B\n\nwhere g_p and g_e are the g-factors for the proton and the electron, respectively. For the electron, g_e ≈ 2, and for the proton, g_p ≈ 5.585.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the energy difference formula as:\n\nΔE = -g_p * μ_N * g_e * μ_B * (1/r^3)\n\nTo convert this energy difference to a frequency, we can use the Planck's relation:\n\nΔf = ΔE / h\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js).\n\nFor the ground state of hydrogen, the distance between the proton and the electron is approximately equal to the Bohr radius (a_0), which is 5.291 x 10^(-11) m. The values of μ_B and μ_N are:\n\nμ_B = 9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T\nμ_N = 5.051 x 10^(-27) J/T\n\nNow, we can plug in all the values and calculate the hyperfine splitting frequency:\n\nΔf = -g_p * μ_N * g_e * μ_B * (1/a_0^3) / h\n\nΔf = -5.585 * (5.051 x 10^(-27) J/T) * 2 * (9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * (1/(5.291 x 10^(-11) m)^3) / (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js)\n\nΔf ≈ 1.420 x 10^9 Hz\n\nSo, the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of a neutral hydrogen atom is approximately 1.420 GHz."
