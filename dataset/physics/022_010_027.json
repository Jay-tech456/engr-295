    "message_2": "If dark matter did not exist in our universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) would appear differently in several ways. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Its presence affects the distribution and evolution of matter density fluctuations, which in turn influence the CMBR.\n\n1. Acoustic Oscillations: The CMBR contains information about the density fluctuations in the early universe, which are seen as temperature fluctuations in the CMBR. These fluctuations are a result of acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma, driven by the competition between gravitational forces (from both ordinary and dark matter) and radiation pressure. If there were no dark matter, the balance between these forces would be different, leading to a different pattern of acoustic oscillations. This would result in a different distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMBR.\n\n2. Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect: The CMBR photons travel through the universe and experience gravitational redshift and blueshift as they pass through regions of varying matter density. This effect, known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, contributes to the temperature fluctuations in the CMBR. Without dark matter, the distribution of matter in the universe would be different, leading to a different ISW effect and thus a different pattern of temperature fluctuations in the CMBR.\n\n3. Lensing Effect: The CMBR photons are also affected by gravitational lensing as they pass through the large-scale structures in the universe. Dark matter contributes significantly to the mass of these structures, and its absence would result in weaker lensing effects. This would lead to a different pattern of temperature fluctuations in the CMBR due to lensing.\n\n4. Overall Amplitude of Fluctuations: Dark matter contributes to the overall matter density of the universe. Without dark matter, the total matter density would be lower, which would affect the amplitude of the density fluctuations in the early universe. Consequently, the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations in the CMBR would also be different.\n\nIn summary, if dark matter did not exist in our universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation would have a different pattern of temperature fluctuations due to the altered balance of forces in the early universe, a different Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a different lensing effect, and a different overall amplitude of fluctuations. These differences would provide valuable information about the nature of dark matter and its role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe."
