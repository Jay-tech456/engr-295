    "message_2": "To find the critical pressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at its critical point, we can use the van der Waals equation of state for real gases, which is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)²)(V/n - b) = RT\n\nWhere:\nP is the pressure,\nn is the number of moles,\nV is the volume,\nT is the temperature,\nR is the gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K for CO₂),\na and b are the van der Waals constants for CO₂ (a = 3.59 L²·atm/mol² and b = 0.0427 L/mol).\n\nAt the critical point, we have the critical pressure (Pc), critical volume (Vc = 0.0942 L/mol), and critical temperature (Tc = 304.2 K). We can rewrite the van der Waals equation in terms of the critical parameters:\n\n(Pc + a/Vc²)(Vc - b) = RTc\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for CO₂ and solve for the critical pressure (Pc):\n\nPc = (RTc / (Vc - b)) - a/Vc²\n\nPc = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K × 304.2 K) / (0.0942 L/mol - 0.0427 L/mol) - 3.59 L²·atm/mol² / (0.0942 L/mol)²\n\nPc = (24.97 atm) / (0.0515 L/mol) - 3.59 L²·atm/mol² / (0.00887 L²/mol²)\n\nPc = 484.97 atm - 404.49 atm\n\nPc ≈ 80.48 atm\n\nThe critical pressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at its critical point is approximately 80.48 atm."
