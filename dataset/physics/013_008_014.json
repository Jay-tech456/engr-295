    "message_2": "To determine the distance to a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon like a gamma-ray burst (GRB) or quasar, we can use observations of their spectra and apply the principles of redshift and standard candles. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Obtain the spectrum: First, we need to obtain the spectrum of the astrophysical phenomenon using a telescope equipped with a spectrograph. This will provide us with information about the wavelengths of light emitted by the object.\n\n2. Identify spectral lines: Next, we need to identify the spectral lines in the spectrum. These lines correspond to specific elements and can be used as a reference to measure the redshift.\n\n3. Measure the redshift: Redshift (z) is a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. By comparing the observed wavelengths of the spectral lines to their rest wavelengths (the wavelengths they would have if the object were not moving away from us), we can determine the redshift of the object. The formula for redshift is:\n\nz = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength\n\n4. Calculate the distance: Once we have the redshift, we can use the Hubble Law and the Hubble constant (H0) to estimate the distance to the object. The Hubble Law states that the recessional velocity (v) of an object is proportional to its distance (d) from the observer:\n\nv = H0 * d\n\nThe recessional velocity can be calculated using the redshift and the speed of light (c):\n\nv = c * z\n\nCombining these equations, we get:\n\nd = (c * z) / H0\n\nBy plugging in the values for c, z, and H0, we can estimate the distance to the astrophysical phenomenon.\n\n5. Use standard candles (optional): For some objects, like certain types of supernovae or quasars, we can use the concept of standard candles. Standard candles are objects with known intrinsic brightness, which allows us to estimate their distance using the inverse square law of light. If we can identify a standard candle in the spectrum of the astrophysical phenomenon, we can compare its observed brightness to its intrinsic brightness and calculate the distance.\n\nIn summary, by analyzing the spectrum of a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon, measuring its redshift, and applying the Hubble Law or using standard candles, we can estimate the distance to the object."
