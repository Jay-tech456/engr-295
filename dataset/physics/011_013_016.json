    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nGiven:\nResistivity (ρ) = 1.68 x 10^-8 Ω m\nLength (L) = 2 meters\nCross-sectional Area (A) = 1 mm^2 = 1 x 10^-6 m^2 (converting to square meters)\n\nNow, let's calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 x 10^-8 Ω m) × (2 m) / (1 x 10^-6 m^2)\nR = 3.36 x 10^-8 Ω / 10^-6\nR = 3.36 x 10^-2 Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 x 10^-8 Ω m)\nσ = 5.95 x 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.95 x 10^7 S/m."
