    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it interacts with other matter through gravitational forces. It is estimated that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (like stars, planets, and gas) makes up only about 5%.\n\nHere are some ways dark matter affects the formation and evolution of galaxies:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to pull ordinary matter together, allowing it to clump and form galaxies. Without dark matter, the gravitational forces from ordinary matter alone would not be strong enough to overcome the expansion of the universe, and galaxies would not form.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxy together and maintain the observed rotation speeds.\n\n3. Large-scale structure: Dark matter plays a significant role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters. These structures form along the cosmic web, which is composed of dark matter filaments. The gravitational pull of dark matter attracts ordinary matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters along these filaments.\n\n4. Galaxy mergers and interactions: Dark matter halos surrounding galaxies can influence their interactions and mergers. When galaxies collide, their dark matter halos can merge, affecting the dynamics of the collision and the resulting galaxy's structure.\n\n5. Stability of galaxies: Dark matter provides additional mass and gravitational force that helps maintain the stability of galaxies. Without dark matter, galaxies would be more susceptible to disruption from external forces, such as tidal forces from nearby galaxies.\n\nIn summary, dark matter plays a critical role in the formation and evolution of galaxies by providing the necessary gravitational force to attract ordinary matter, influencing galaxy rotation curves, contributing to large-scale structures, affecting galaxy interactions, and maintaining the stability of galaxies. Without dark matter, the universe would look very different, and the formation of galaxies as we know them would not be possible."
