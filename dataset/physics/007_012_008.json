    "message_2": "Nuclear fusion in a deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuel mixture typically occurs at extremely high temperatures. For the fusion reaction to take place, the positively charged nuclei of deuterium and tritium must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them, known as the Coulomb barrier. This requires the particles to have sufficient kinetic energy, which is directly related to temperature.\n\nThe minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion to occur in a D-T fuel mixture, assuming ideal conditions, is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 x 10^6 K). At this temperature, the kinetic energy of the particles is high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier, allowing the deuterium and tritium nuclei to come close enough to each other for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion."
