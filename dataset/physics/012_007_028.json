    "message_2": "The maximum energy gain of a proton in a plasma-based particle accelerator can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEnergy gain (eV) = Charge of proton (Coulombs) × Electric field (V/m) × Length of accelerator (m)\n\nThe charge of a proton is approximately 1.602 × 10^(-19) Coulombs, the electric field is given as 100 MV/m (which is 100 × 10^6 V/m), and the length of the accelerator is 1 meter.\n\nEnergy gain (eV) = (1.602 × 10^(-19) C) × (100 × 10^6 V/m) × (1 m)\n\nEnergy gain (eV) = 1.602 × 10^(-19) C × 10^8 V\n\nEnergy gain (eV) = 1.602 × 10^(-11) C × V\n\nTo convert the energy gain from electron volts (eV) to joules (J), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) J:\n\nEnergy gain (J) = (1.602 × 10^(-11) C × V) × (1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV)\n\nEnergy gain (J) = 2.566 × 10^(-30) J\n\nSo, the maximum energy gain a proton can achieve in this plasma-based particle accelerator is approximately 2.566 × 10^(-30) joules."
