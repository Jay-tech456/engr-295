    "message_2": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the strong interaction, which is the force that binds quarks and gluons together to form hadrons, mesons, and baryons. To compute the strong interaction phenomena using QCD, we need to employ a combination of theoretical frameworks and numerical techniques. Here is an outline of the steps involved:\n\n1. Understand the basic principles of QCD: QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory based on the SU(3) group. It involves the exchange of gluons between quarks, which carry a \"color\" charge. The strong force is mediated by eight different types of gluons, and the interaction strength is determined by the strong coupling constant, αs.\n\n2. Use perturbative QCD (pQCD) for high-energy processes: In situations where the energy scale is much larger than the QCD scale (ΛQCD), the strong coupling constant becomes small, and we can use perturbation theory to compute the interaction processes. This involves expanding the QCD amplitudes in a power series of αs and calculating the Feynman diagrams for each order. Examples of high-energy processes include deep inelastic scattering, jet production in e+e- collisions, and high transverse momentum processes in hadron collisions.\n\n3. Employ non-perturbative methods for low-energy processes: When the energy scale is comparable to or smaller than ΛQCD, the strong coupling constant becomes large, and perturbation theory is no longer applicable. In these cases, we need to use non-perturbative methods such as lattice QCD, which discretizes spacetime on a grid and solves the QCD equations numerically. Lattice QCD can be used to compute hadron masses, decay constants, and other low-energy observables.\n\n4. Use effective field theories (EFTs) to simplify calculations: EFTs are a powerful tool to systematically integrate out high-energy degrees of freedom and focus on the relevant low-energy physics. For example, chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is an EFT that describes the interactions of low-energy pions and nucleons based on the symmetries of QCD. Heavy quark effective theory (HQET) is another EFT that simplifies the description of heavy quark systems, such as bottom and charm mesons.\n\n5. Combine perturbative and non-perturbative methods: In some cases, we need to match the results from perturbative and non-perturbative calculations to obtain a complete description of the strong interaction phenomena. For example, parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the probability of finding a quark or gluon with a given momentum fraction inside a hadron. These functions are determined from global fits to experimental data, combining perturbative QCD calculations for hard processes with non-perturbative input for the hadron structure.\n\n6. Compare with experimental data: Finally, the results of QCD calculations should be compared with experimental data from particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and electron-positron colliders. This allows us to test the validity of QCD, determine the values of its parameters (such as αs and quark masses), and improve our understanding of the strong interaction phenomena.\n\nIn summary, computing strong interaction phenomena using QCD involves a combination of perturbative and non-perturbative methods, effective field theories, and lattice QCD simulations. These techniques allow us to describe the production of hadrons, mesons, and baryons from quarks and gluons and compare our predictions with experimental data."
