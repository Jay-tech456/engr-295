    "message_2": "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the latest experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG) gives the measured mass of the top quark as approximately 173.1 ± 0.9 GeV/c². This value is based on a combination of measurements from various experiments, including those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Tevatron. Please note that this value may be updated as new experimental data becomes available."
