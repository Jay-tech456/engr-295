    "message_2": "The estimated total mass of dark matter in the observable universe is approximately 2.4 x 10^43 kg or 24 trillion solar masses. This estimate is based on the current understanding of the composition of the universe, which is roughly 26.8% dark matter, 68.3% dark energy, and 4.9% ordinary matter (baryonic matter).\n\nThe evidence supporting the existence of dark matter comes from various observations and phenomena, including:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: The observed rotational speeds of galaxies do not match the predictions based on the visible matter alone. The outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, as predicted by general relativity, is more significant than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. The additional mass causing this lensing effect is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters. Observations of this system show that the majority of the mass, as inferred from gravitational lensing, is separated from the visible matter (gas and stars). This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nThese lines of evidence, along with others, strongly support the conclusion that dark matter exists and makes up a significant portion of the total mass in the observable universe."
