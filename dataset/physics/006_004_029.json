    "message_2": "The Stark effect is the splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. In the case of the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are perturbed by the external electric field, leading to shifts in the energy levels and, consequently, the spectral line wavelengths.\n\nTo calculate the energy level transitions and spectral line wavelengths, we need to consider the perturbation theory. The first-order perturbation to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom due to the Stark effect can be expressed as:\n\nΔE = -e * F * z\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, e is the charge of the electron (1.6 x 10^-19 C), F is the magnitude of the external electric field (3 x 10^6 V/m), and z is the position of the electron along the direction of the electric field.\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the energy level transitions between the n=2 and n=1 levels in the hydrogen atom. The energy levels for the hydrogen atom without the Stark effect are given by:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nFor the n=1 level, E_1 = -13.6 eV, and for the n=2 level, E_2 = -3.4 eV. The energy difference between these levels is:\n\nΔE_0 = E_2 - E_1 = 10.2 eV\n\nNow, we need to consider the perturbation due to the Stark effect. The first-order perturbation to the energy levels can be calculated using the formula mentioned earlier. However, the exact value of z depends on the specific quantum state (i.e., the values of the quantum numbers n, l, and m) and the orientation of the electric field relative to the atom.\n\nIn general, the Stark effect will cause the energy levels to shift by different amounts, leading to a splitting of the spectral lines. The new energy difference between the perturbed levels can be expressed as:\n\nΔE_new = ΔE_0 + ΔE_perturbation\n\nwhere ΔE_perturbation is the change in energy due to the Stark effect.\n\nFinally, the spectral line wavelengths can be calculated using the relation between energy and wavelength:\n\nλ = (h * c) / E\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and E is the energy difference between the levels.\n\nBy plugging in the new energy difference (ΔE_new) into this equation, we can calculate the spectral line wavelengths for the hydrogen atom experiencing the Stark effect due to an external electric field of magnitude 3 x 10^6 V/m. Keep in mind that the exact values of the wavelengths will depend on the specific quantum states and the orientation of the electric field relative to the atom."
