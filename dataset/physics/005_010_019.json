    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at a velocity of 0.9c relative to Earth. A beam of light is emitted from Earth towards the spaceship. According to the observer on the spaceship, the angle between the direction of the beam of light and the direction of motion of the spaceship is 30 degrees. What is the angle between the direction of the beam of light and the direction of motion of the spaceship according to an observer on Earth? (Use the formula for the relativistic aberration of light to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the relativistic aberration of light, which is given by:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ)))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the direction of the beam of light and the direction of motion of the spaceship according to the observer on the spaceship, θ' is the angle according to an observer on Earth, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.9c), c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81) = 1 / sqrt(0.19) ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for the relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(30°) / (2.294(1 + (0.9c/c)cos(30°)))\n\nsin(θ') = 0.5 / (2.294(1 + 0.9cos(30°)))\n\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.5 / (2.294(1 + 0.9 * 0.866))\n\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.5 / (2.294 * 1.779)\n\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.5 / 4.082 ≈ 0.122\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ':\n\nθ' = arcsin(0.122) ≈ 7.1°\n\nSo, according to an observer on Earth, the angle between the direction of the beam of light and the direction of motion of the spaceship is approximately 7.1 degrees."
