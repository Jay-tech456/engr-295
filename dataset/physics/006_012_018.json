    "message_2": "The minimum energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state, also known as the ionization energy, can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/n^2)\n\nIn this formula, E is the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom, n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state), and 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen.\n\nFor the ground state (n = 1):\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus. To ionize the hydrogen atom, we need to provide energy equal to the absolute value of this energy:\n\nIonization energy = |-13.6 eV| = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the minimum energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
