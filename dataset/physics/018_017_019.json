    "message_2": "To calculate the energy density of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at a temperature of 2 trillion degrees Celsius, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a massless gas, which states that the energy density (ε) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T):\n\nε = σ * T^4\n\nHere, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 5.67 x 10^(-8) W m^(-2) K^(-4) for blackbody radiation. However, for QGP, we need to consider the degrees of freedom (dof) and the strong coupling constant (α_s). The dof for QGP is 47.5 (37 for quarks and 10.5 for gluons). The strong coupling constant, α_s, is approximately 0.3 at high energies.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 2 trillion degrees Celsius + 273.15\nT ≈ 2 x 10^12 + 273.15 K\nT ≈ 2 x 10^12 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy density of QGP:\n\nε_QGP = (dof * π^2 / 30) * (k_B * T)^4 / (ħ * c)^3 * (1 - α_s)\n\nHere, k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^(-23) J K^(-1)), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nε_QGP ≈ (47.5 * π^2 / 30) * (1.38 x 10^(-23) * 2 x 10^12)^4 / (1.054 x 10^(-34) * 3 x 10^8)^3 * (1 - 0.3)\nε_QGP ≈ 1.8 x 10^36 J/m^3\n\nThe energy density of the universe shortly after the Big Bang, during the radiation-dominated era, can be estimated using the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is about 2.7 K today. The temperature of the universe at the time was much higher, around 10^13 K. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a massless gas, we can calculate the energy density:\n\nε_universe = σ * T^4\nε_universe ≈ 5.67 x 10^(-8) * (10^13)^4\nε_universe ≈ 5.67 x 10^44 J/m^3\n\nComparing the energy densities:\n\nRatio = ε_QGP / ε_universe\nRatio ≈ (1.8 x 10^36) / (5.67 x 10^44)\nRatio ≈ 3.17 x 10^(-9)\n\nThe energy density of the Quark-Gluon Plasma at 2 trillion degrees Celsius is about 3.17 x 10^(-9) times the energy density of the universe shortly after the Big Bang."
