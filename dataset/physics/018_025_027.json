How does this compare to experimental measurements of the Higgs boson decay into two photons that have been performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)?",
    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson cannot directly decay into two photons because the Higgs boson only couples to particles with mass, and photons are massless. However, the Higgs boson can decay into two photons through loop processes involving virtual particles. The main channels for the Higgs boson decay into two photons are:\n\n1. The W boson loop: In this process, the Higgs boson decays into two virtual W bosons, which then convert into two photons. This is the dominant channel for the Higgs boson decay into two photons.\n\n2. The top quark loop: In this process, the Higgs boson decays into a virtual top quark-antiquark pair, which then convert into two photons. This channel has a smaller contribution to the decay process compared to the W boson loop.\n\nAccording to the Standard Model, the branching ratio for the Higgs boson decay into two photons (H → γγ) is approximately 0.2%. This means that out of every 1000 Higgs boson decays, about 2 will result in two photons.\n\nExperimental measurements of the Higgs boson decay into two photons have been performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The observed branching ratios are consistent with the Standard Model predictions. The ATLAS collaboration measured a branching ratio of 0.22% ± 0.11%, while the CMS collaboration measured a branching ratio of 0.18% ± 0.10%. These measurements are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, providing further evidence for the validity of the Standard Model."
