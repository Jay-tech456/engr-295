    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is the radius of the event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere:\n- r_s is the Schwarzschild radius\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of our Sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Since the black hole is 10 times the mass of our Sun, its mass (M) is:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * (6.67430 × 10^-11) * (1.989 × 10^31)) / (8.98755179 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (2.648 × 10^20) / (8.98755179 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.945 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass 10 times that of our Sun is approximately 2,945 meters or 2.945 kilometers."
