    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by a converging lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the distance of the object from the lens, and v is the distance of the image from the lens.\n\nGiven, the object distance (u) is 20 cm and the focal length (f) is 10 cm. We need to find the image distance (v).\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n2/20 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 1/20 from both sides:\n\n1/v = 2/20 - 1/20\n\n1/v = 1/20\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSo, the distance of the image from the lens is 20 cm."
