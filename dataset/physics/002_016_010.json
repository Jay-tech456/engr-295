    "message_2": "To calculate the critical temperature of the substance, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given the vapor pressure at 298 K (P1 = 1.5 atm) and the boiling point at normal pressure (T2 = 350 K, P2 = 1 atm). We can convert the pressures to Pascals (Pa) for consistency with the units of R:\n\nP1 = 1.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 151987.5 Pa\nP2 = 1 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 101325 Pa\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(101325/151987.5) = -(45000 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/350 K - 1/T1)\n\nSolving for T1:\n\n1/T1 = 1/350 + ln(101325/151987.5) * (8.314 J/mol·K) / (45000 J/mol)\n1/T1 ≈ 0.002857 + 0.000233\n1/T1 ≈ 0.003090\n\nT1 ≈ 1 / 0.003090\nT1 ≈ 323.62 K\n\nNow we can use the critical temperature and boiling point relationship:\n\nTc = Tb * (1 + a)\nwhere a = (1 - T1/Tb) / (1 - T1/Tc)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Tc:\n\nTc = Tb * (1 + a) / (1 - T1/Tb * a)\n\nWe know Tb = 350 K, T1 = 323.62 K, and a = (1 - T1/Tb) / (1 - T1/Tc). We can substitute T1 and Tb into the equation for a:\n\na = (1 - 323.62/350) / (1 - 323.62/Tc)\n\nNow we can substitute a back into the equation for Tc:\n\nTc = 350 * (1 + (1 - 323.62/350) / (1 - 323.62/Tc)) / (1 - 323.62/350 * (1 - 323.62/350) / (1 - 323.62/Tc))\n\nThis equation can be solved numerically for Tc:\n\nTc ≈ 518.6 K\n\nTherefore, the critical temperature of the substance is approximately 518.6 K."
