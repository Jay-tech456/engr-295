The fluid is incompressible and has a constant viscosity. Determine the expression for the velocity profile and the shear stress distribution in terms of a non-dimensional quantity.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are considering a slow, incompressible fluid flow between two parallel plates. Since the flow is slow, we can assume that the inertial forces are negligible compared to the viscous forces. This allows us to simplify the 3D Navier-Stokes equation to the 3D Stokes equation. \n\nFor an incompressible fluid, the continuity equation is given by:\n\n∇ • u = 0\n\nwhere u is the velocity vector.\n\nThe 3D Stokes equation is given by:\n\n-∇p + μ∇²u = 0\n\nwhere p is the pressure, μ is the dynamic viscosity, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nLet's assume that the flow is fully developed, and the velocity components in the x and y directions are u and v, respectively. The z direction is perpendicular to the plates. Since the flow is fully developed, there is no variation in the x and y directions, and the velocity components u and v are functions of z only.\n\nThe simplified Stokes equation in the x and y directions are:\n\nd²u/dz² = (1/μ) dp/dx\n\nd²v/dz² = (1/μ) dp/dy\n\nIntegrating the above equations with respect to z, we get:\n\ndu/dz = (1/μ) (dp/dx) z + C1\n\ndv/dz = (1/μ) (dp/dy) z + C2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants of integration.\n\nApplying the no-slip boundary condition at the plates (z = 0 and z = h), we get:\n\nu(0) = 0 => C1 = 0\nu(h) = 0 => (1/μ) (dp/dx) h = 0 => dp/dx = 0\n\nv(0) = 0 => C2 = 0\nv(h) = 0 => (1/μ) (dp/dy) h = 0 => dp/dy = 0\n\nSince dp/dx = 0 and dp/dy = 0, the pressure gradient in the x and y directions is zero. Therefore, the velocity components u and v are constant with respect to z:\n\nu(z) = 0\nv(z) = 0\n\nThe velocity profile is given by u(z) = 0 and v(z) = 0, which means the fluid is not flowing between the plates.\n\nThe shear stress distribution τ can be found using the following relation:\n\nτ = μ(du/dz)\n\nSince u(z) = 0, the shear stress distribution is also zero:\n\nτ(z) = 0\n\nIn terms of a non-dimensional quantity, we can define the non-dimensional velocity U* and non-dimensional vertical coordinate Z* as:\n\nU* = u/U_max\nZ* = z/h\n\nSince u(z) = 0, the non-dimensional velocity profile is:\n\nU*(Z*) = 0\n\nAnd the non-dimensional shear stress distribution is:\n\nτ*(Z*) = 0"
