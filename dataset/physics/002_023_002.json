    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 KJ/mol, and we need to find the vapor pressure of water (P2) at 298 K (T2). We can use the known vapor pressure of water at 373 K (T1) as a reference point. At 373 K, the vapor pressure of water (P1) is 1 atm (101.3 kPa).\n\nFirst, let's convert the enthalpy of vaporization to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 KJ/mol * (1000 J/KJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40700 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298 K - 1/373 K)\n\nTo solve for P2, we can first calculate the value inside the natural logarithm:\n\nx = -40700 / 8.314 * (1/298 - 1/373)\nx ≈ 10.15\n\nNow, we can solve for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.3 * e^10.15\nP2 ≈ 2.338 * 10^4 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 298 K is approximately 23,380 kPa."
