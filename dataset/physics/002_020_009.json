    "message_1": "What is the compressibility factor of a 2 moles monoatomic ideal gas at a pressure of 3 atm and a temperature of 500 K?",
    "message_2": "The compressibility factor (Z) is a dimensionless quantity that represents the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. For an ideal gas, the compressibility factor is equal to 1. Since the problem states that we are dealing with an ideal gas, we can directly conclude that the compressibility factor Z = 1."
