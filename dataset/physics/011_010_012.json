    "message_2": "To find the dielectric constant of a crystal, we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation, which relates the dielectric constant to the polarizability of the crystal:\n\nK = (1 + 2χ) / (1 - χ)\n\nwhere K is the dielectric constant and χ is the electric susceptibility of the crystal.\n\nThe electric susceptibility (χ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nχ = Nα / 3ε₀\n\nwhere N is the number of dipoles per unit volume, α is the polarizability of the crystal, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²).\n\nFirst, we need to find the polarizability (α) of the crystal using the dipole moment (p) and the lattice parameter (a). The dipole moment (p) can be converted from Debye to Coulomb·meters using the conversion factor 1 Debye = 3.336 x 10^(-30) C·m:\n\np = 2.5 Debye * (3.336 x 10^(-30) C·m/Debye) = 8.34 x 10^(-30) C·m\n\nThe polarizability (α) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = p² / (3kT)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^(-23) J/K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Assuming room temperature (T = 298 K), we can calculate the polarizability:\n\nα = (8.34 x 10^(-30) C·m)² / (3 * 1.381 x 10^(-23) J/K * 298 K) = 2.16 x 10^(-40) C²·m²/N\n\nNext, we need to find the number of dipoles per unit volume (N). Since the crystal has a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The volume of the unit cell can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a):\n\nV = a³ = (5 x 10^(-10) m)³ = 1.25 x 10^(-28) m³\n\nThe number of dipoles per unit volume (N) can be calculated as:\n\nN = 4 atoms/unit cell / (1.25 x 10^(-28) m³/unit cell) = 3.2 x 10^(28) m^(-3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the electric susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = Nα / 3ε₀ = (3.2 x 10^(28) m^(-3)) * (2.16 x 10^(-40) C²·m²/N) / (3 * 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²) = 0.027\n\nFinally, we can calculate the dielectric constant (K) using the Clausius-Mossotti equation:\n\nK = (1 + 2χ) / (1 - χ) = (1 + 2 * 0.027) / (1 - 0.027) = 1.056 / 0.973 = 1.085\n\nThe dielectric constant of the crystal is approximately 1.085."
