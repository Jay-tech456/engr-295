    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (1/n_final² - 1/n_initial²)\n\nIn this case, the electron is transitioning from the n=2 energy level to the n=∞ energy level. So, n_initial = 2 and n_final = ∞.\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (1/∞² - 1/2²)\n\nSince 1/∞² is essentially zero:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (0 - 1/4)\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (-1/4)\n\nIonization energy = 3.4 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom when the electron transition takes place from the n=2 energy level to the n=∞ energy level is 3.4 eV."
