    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field produced by the rod at a point on its perpendicular bisector, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nSince the point is on the perpendicular bisector of the rod, we can divide the rod into two equal parts, each with a length of 7.5 cm (half of the total length). We can then find the magnetic field produced by each half and add them together.\n\nLet's consider the first half of the rod. We can integrate the Biot-Savart law along the length of the rod:\n\nB₁ = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r₁²)\n\nwhere r₁ is the distance from the first half of the rod to the point.\n\nNow, let's consider the second half of the rod:\n\nB₂ = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r₂²)\n\nwhere r₂ is the distance from the second half of the rod to the point.\n\nSince the point is on the perpendicular bisector, r₁ = r₂ = r. Therefore, we can add the magnetic fields produced by each half of the rod:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²) + ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nB_total = 2 * ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB_total = 2 * ∫(4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3.2 A * dl) / (4 * π * (0.05 m)²)\n\nB_total = 2 * ∫(1.28 × 10⁻⁶ Tm * dl) / (0.0025 m²)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field, we need to integrate this expression along the length of the rod (from 0 to 0.075 m):\n\nB_total = 2 * [1.28 × 10⁻⁶ Tm * (0.075 m - 0 m)] / (0.0025 m²)\n\nB_total = 2 * (9.6 × 10⁻⁸ T) / (0.0025 m²)\n\nB_total ≈ 7.68 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the rod at a point 5 cm away from the center of the rod, on its perpendicular bisector, is approximately 7.68 × 10⁻⁵ T."
