    "message_2": "To determine the location of the image, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\ndo = 20 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/15 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60di, we get:\n\n4di = 3di + 60\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ndi = 60 cm\n\nSo, the image is located 60 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, let's determine the characteristics of the image:\n\n1. Real or virtual: Since the object is placed outside the focal length of the converging lens, the image will be real.\n\n2. Upright or inverted: Real images formed by converging lenses are always inverted.\n\n3. Magnified or reduced: To determine this, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification = -di/do\n\nmagnification = -60/20 = -3\n\nSince the magnification is -3 (negative), the image is inverted and 3 times larger than the object, so it is magnified.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is located 60 cm from the lens, it is real, inverted, and magnified."
