    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays from a distant object are not focused at a single point after reflecting off a spherical mirror. This is due to the fact that rays closer to the edge of the mirror have a shorter focal length than rays closer to the center. The maximum possible spherical aberration is the difference in focal lengths between the edge and the center of the mirror.\n\nTo calculate the maximum possible spherical aberration, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = (1/R) - (1/R')\n\nwhere f is the focal length, R is the radius of curvature of the mirror, and R' is the radius of curvature of the mirror at the edge.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of curvature (R) of the mirror. Since the focal length (f) is given as 20 cm, we can use the formula:\n\nR = 2f\n\nR = 2 * 20 cm = 40 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the radius of curvature at the edge of the mirror (R'). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the center of the mirror to the edge:\n\nr = (diameter / 2) = 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm\n\nThe distance from the center of the mirror to the edge (r) and the radius of curvature (R) form a right triangle with the distance from the edge of the mirror to the center of curvature (R') as the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nR'^2 = R^2 + r^2\n\nR'^2 = (40 cm)^2 + (15 cm)^2 = 1600 cm^2 + 225 cm^2 = 1825 cm^2\n\nR' = √1825 cm^2 ≈ 42.72 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the focal length at the edge of the mirror (f'):\n\n1/f' = (1/R) - (1/R')\n\n1/f' = (1/40 cm) - (1/42.72 cm) ≈ 0.025 - 0.0234 = 0.0016 cm^(-1)\n\nf' ≈ 1 / 0.0016 cm^(-1) ≈ 625 cm\n\nThe maximum possible spherical aberration is the difference between the focal lengths at the center and the edge of the mirror:\n\nSpherical aberration = |f' - f| = |625 cm - 20 cm| = 605 cm"
