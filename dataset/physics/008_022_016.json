    "message_2": "The weak mixing angle, also known as the Weinberg angle or the electroweak mixing angle, is a parameter in the electroweak theory of particle physics that determines the relative strengths of the weak and electromagnetic forces. It is usually denoted by the symbol θ_W.\n\nThe precise value of the weak mixing angle as measured at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN is sin²θ_W = 0.23122. The uncertainty associated with this measurement is ±0.00016.\n\nThis value and its uncertainty are obtained from a combination of several experiments conducted at the LEP collider, including measurements of the Z boson properties, as well as other measurements from the SLD, Tevatron, and LHC experiments. The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics, and its precise determination is crucial for testing the consistency of the model and for predicting the properties of undiscovered particles."
