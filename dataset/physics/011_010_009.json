    "message_2": "To calculate the dielectric constant of a crystal of NaCl, we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation:\n\nK = (1 + 2χ) / (1 - χ)\n\nwhere K is the dielectric constant and χ is the electric susceptibility. The electric susceptibility can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nχ = (4πNα) / 3ε₀\n\nwhere N is the number of ions per unit volume, α is the polarizability of the ions, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ions per unit volume (N). Since the crystal is cubic and has a perfect structure, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell:\n\nV = a³\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant (5.64 Å or 5.64 x 10^(-10) m).\n\nV = (5.64 x 10^(-10) m)³ = 1.79 x 10^(-28) m³\n\nThere are 4 NaCl formula units per unit cell in a cubic crystal structure. Therefore, the number of ions (both Na+ and Cl-) per unit cell is 8. To find the number of ions per unit volume, we can divide the number of ions per unit cell by the volume of the unit cell:\n\nN = 8 / (1.79 x 10^(-28) m³) = 4.47 x 10^(27) ions/m³\n\nNext, we need to find the polarizability (α) of the ions. We can use the following equation:\n\nα = e²a² / (4πε₀R)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C), a is the lattice constant, and R is the ionicity factor.\n\nα = (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)²(5.64 x 10^(-10) m)² / (4π(8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²)(1.747)) = 3.29 x 10^(-41) C²·m²/N\n\nNow, we can calculate the electric susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = (4π(4.47 x 10^(27) ions/m³)(3.29 x 10^(-41) C²·m²/N)) / 3(8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²) = 0.514\n\nFinally, we can calculate the dielectric constant (K):\n\nK = (1 + 2(0.514)) / (1 - 0.514) = 3.06\n\nThe dielectric constant of the NaCl crystal is approximately 3.06."
