    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. It is also known as the Schwarzschild radius. The event horizon is directly related to the mass of the black hole and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEvent Horizon (Schwarzschild radius) = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the event horizon of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass into kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so 3 solar masses would be:\n\n3 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nEvent Horizon = 2(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)(5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nEvent Horizon â‰ˆ 8.856 x 10^3 meters or 8.856 kilometers\n\nThe event horizon of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8.856 kilometers. Note that the radius given in the problem (9 kilometers) is not needed for this calculation, as the event horizon is determined solely by the mass of the black hole."
