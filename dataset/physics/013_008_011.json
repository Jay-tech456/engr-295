    "message_2": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that emit intense gamma-ray radiation, making them the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. They are detected at cosmological distances, and their durations range from milliseconds to several minutes. GRBs are classified into two categories based on their duration: short-duration GRBs (less than 2 seconds) and long-duration GRBs (more than 2 seconds).\n\nThe mechanisms behind the emission of gamma-ray bursts are still not fully understood, but several theoretical models have been proposed to explain their origins. The most widely accepted models for long-duration GRBs involve the collapse of massive stars, while short-duration GRBs are thought to be caused by the merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes.\n\nLong-duration GRBs are believed to be associated with the final stages of massive star evolution. Massive stars, with masses greater than 20-30 times the mass of the Sun, undergo a process called core-collapse supernova when they reach the end of their lives. In some cases, the core-collapse supernova can lead to the formation of a black hole. The most popular model for long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, which involves the formation of a rapidly rotating black hole. In this model, the collapsing core of the massive star forms a black hole, and the surrounding material forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields in the system can launch a pair of relativistic jets along the rotation axis. These jets can break through the outer layers of the star and emit gamma-ray radiation, producing a gamma-ray burst.\n\nShort-duration GRBs are thought to be caused by the merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes. When two compact objects orbit each other, they lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves, causing their orbits to decay. Eventually, the objects merge, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of gamma-ray radiation. This process is known as the binary merger model.\n\nAstrophysical observations support these theoretical models. For example, long-duration GRBs have been found to be associated with supernovae in star-forming galaxies, suggesting a connection to massive star evolution. Additionally, the recent detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger, accompanied by a short-duration GRB, provides strong evidence for the binary merger model.\n\nIn conclusion, gamma-ray bursts are linked to the formation and evolution of massive stars in the universe through the core-collapse supernova process and the formation of black holes. Long-duration GRBs are associated with the collapse of massive stars, while short-duration GRBs are related to the merger of compact objects. These connections are supported by both theoretical models and astrophysical observations."
