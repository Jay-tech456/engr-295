    "message_2": "The weak mixing angle, also known as the Weinberg angle or the electroweak mixing angle, is a parameter in the electroweak theory of particle physics that describes the mixing between the electromagnetic and weak forces. At the energy scale of 91.1876 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the Z boson, the weak mixing angle was measured in the LEP collider experiment.\n\nThe value of the weak mixing angle (θ_W) at this energy scale is approximately 0.23126, or equivalently, sin²θ_W ≈ 0.23126. This value is obtained from the precisely measured quantities like the Z boson mass, the W boson mass, and the electromagnetic coupling constant. It is important to note that the weak mixing angle is a running parameter, meaning its value depends on the energy scale at which it is measured."
