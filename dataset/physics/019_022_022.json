    "message_2": "The relation between holographic dualities and entanglement entropy in a 2+1-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) defined on a compact manifold can be understood through the AdS/CFT correspondence. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between a gravitational theory in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on its boundary.\n\nEntanglement entropy is a measure of the quantum entanglement between two subsystems in a quantum system. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the entanglement entropy of a region in the boundary CFT can be computed using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, which relates the entanglement entropy to the area of a minimal surface in the bulk AdS space.\n\nTo find the holographic dual of a free massive scalar field using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the action for the free massive scalar field in the 2+1-dimensional QFT on a compact manifold. The action is given by:\n\nS = ∫d^3x √g [1/2 (∇φ)^2 - 1/2 m^2 φ^2],\n\nwhere φ is the scalar field, m is its mass, and g is the determinant of the metric tensor.\n\n2. Find the equation of motion for the scalar field by varying the action with respect to φ:\n\n∇^2 φ - m^2 φ = 0.\n\n3. Solve the equation of motion in the AdS space. The AdS metric in Poincaré coordinates is given by:\n\nds^2 = (L/z)^2 (dz^2 + η_μν dx^μ dx^ν),\n\nwhere L is the AdS radius, z is the radial coordinate, and η_μν is the Minkowski metric.\n\n4. Impose the appropriate boundary conditions for the scalar field at the AdS boundary (z → 0). The solution should behave as:\n\nφ(z, x) ~ z^Δ f(x),\n\nwhere Δ is the conformal dimension of the dual operator in the boundary CFT, and f(x) is a function of the boundary coordinates.\n\n5. Compute the entanglement entropy of a region in the boundary CFT using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula:\n\nS_E = Area(Γ_A)/4G_N,\n\nwhere Γ_A is the minimal surface in the bulk AdS space whose boundary coincides with the entangling surface in the boundary CFT, and G_N is the Newton's constant in the bulk gravitational theory.\n\n6. Analyze the validity of the duality in the strong coupling limit. In the strong coupling limit, the bulk gravitational theory becomes strongly coupled, and the classical gravity approximation may not be valid. One needs to consider higher-order corrections in the gravitational action, such as higher-curvature terms, to capture the full quantum behavior of the system. The validity of the duality in this limit depends on the convergence of these corrections and their impact on the entanglement entropy calculation.\n\nIn summary, the relation between holographic dualities and entanglement entropy in a 2+1-dimensional QFT on a compact manifold can be understood through the AdS/CFT correspondence and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. The holographic dual of a free massive scalar field can be found by solving its equation of motion in the AdS space and imposing appropriate boundary conditions. The validity of the duality in the strong coupling limit depends on the convergence of higher-order corrections in the gravitational action and their impact on the entanglement entropy calculation."
