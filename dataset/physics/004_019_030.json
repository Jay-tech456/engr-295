(Assume the observer's clock in the absence of gravity ticks once every second.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect experienced by an observer orbiting a black hole, we can use the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. The time dilation factor is given by:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\n\nwhere:\nt' is the time experienced by the observer near the black hole\nt is the time experienced by the observer far from any significant gravitational source\nG is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM is the mass of the black hole\nr is the distance from the center of the black hole to the observer\nc is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass 10 times greater than the sun, we have:\n\nM = 10 * M_sun = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe distance from the event horizon to the observer is 100 km, so we need to find the Schwarzschild radius (R_s) first:\n\nR_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2 = (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nR_s ≈ 2.954 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, we can find the distance from the center of the black hole to the observer (r):\n\nr = R_s + 100 km = 2.954 x 10^4 m + 100 x 10^3 m = 1.2954 x 10^5 m\n\nNow we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\nt' = 1 s * sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (1.2954 x 10^5 m * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\nt' ≈ 1 s * sqrt(1 - 0.655)\nt' ≈ 1 s * sqrt(0.345)\nt' ≈ 1 s * 0.587\n\nSo, the time dilation effect experienced by the observer orbiting the black hole is approximately 0.587 seconds for every second experienced by the observer far from any significant gravitational source."
