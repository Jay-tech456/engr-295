    "message_2": "In high-energy physics, supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical concept that proposes a relationship between the two fundamental classes of particles: bosons and fermions. The main difference between a supersymmetric particle and a non-supersymmetric particle lies in their spin and the symmetry that relates them.\n\nBosons are particles with integer spins (e.g., 0, 1, 2) and are responsible for mediating forces between other particles. Examples include photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons. Fermions, on the other hand, have half-integer spins (e.g., 1/2, 3/2) and make up the matter in the universe. Examples include electrons, quarks, and neutrinos.\n\nIn supersymmetry, every particle has a \"superpartner\" with a spin that differs by 1/2. For example, a fermion with a spin of 1/2 would have a bosonic superpartner with a spin of 0, and a boson with a spin of 1 would have a fermionic superpartner with a spin of 1/2. These supersymmetric particles are often denoted with a tilde (~) above the symbol of their corresponding standard model particle (e.g., selectron for the supersymmetric partner of the electron).\n\nThe presence of supersymmetric particles can be experimentally detected through their production and decay processes in high-energy particle collisions, such as those occurring at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Supersymmetric particles are expected to be heavier than their standard model counterparts, so they would decay into lighter particles, including the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable and could serve as a candidate for dark matter.\n\nTo detect supersymmetric particles, physicists look for signatures of their production and decay in the data collected from particle collisions. This involves searching for events with specific characteristics, such as an excess of certain particle types or an imbalance in the total momentum of the detected particles (due to the undetected LSP escaping the detector). If the observed data shows a statistically significant deviation from the predictions of the standard model, it could be evidence for the existence of supersymmetric particles.\n\nHowever, despite extensive searches, no supersymmetric particles have been discovered so far, and the experimental limits on their masses and properties have become increasingly stringent. This has led to ongoing debates about the viability of supersymmetry as a solution to some of the outstanding problems in particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter."
