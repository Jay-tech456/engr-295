    "message_2": "To find the fugacity of water vapor at a pressure of 1 bar and temperature of 100°C, we can use the steam tables. Steam tables provide properties of water and steam, such as enthalpy, entropy, specific volume, and fugacity, at various temperatures and pressures.\n\nFirst, we need to find the saturation pressure of water at 100°C. From the steam tables, the saturation pressure of water at 100°C is approximately 1.014 bar.\n\nNow, we can find the fugacity coefficient (φ) using the steam tables. At 100°C and 1 bar, the fugacity coefficient of water vapor is approximately 0.995.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity (f) using the following equation:\n\nf = φ * P\n\nwhere f is the fugacity, φ is the fugacity coefficient, and P is the pressure.\n\nf = 0.995 * 1 bar = 0.995 bar\n\nSo, the fugacity of water vapor at a pressure of 1 bar and temperature of 100°C is approximately 0.995 bar."
