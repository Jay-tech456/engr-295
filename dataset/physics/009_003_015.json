    "message_1": "A light ray travels from medium A into medium B at an angle of incidence of 30 degrees. The refractive index of medium A is 1.5 and the critical angle for total internal reflection at the boundary of medium A and B is 42 degrees. Calculate the angle of refraction and determine whether the light ray undergoes total internal reflection or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the light ray undergoes total internal reflection, we first need to compare the angle of incidence (30 degrees) with the critical angle (42 degrees). Since the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, total internal reflection does not occur.\n\nNow, let's calculate the angle of refraction using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of medium A, θ1 is the angle of incidence, n2 is the refractive index of medium B, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nWe are given n1 = 1.5 and θ1 = 30 degrees. We can find n2 using the critical angle formula:\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere θc is the critical angle.\n\nsin(42) = n2 / 1.5\n\nn2 = 1.5 * sin(42) ≈ 1.01\n\nNow we can use Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction:\n\n1.5 * sin(30) = 1.01 * sin(θ2)\n\n0.75 = 1.01 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.75 / 1.01 ≈ 0.743\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.743) ≈ 48.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 48.3 degrees, and the light ray does not undergo total internal reflection."
