    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy, we first need to find the total energy of the particle. The rest energy of the particle is given by $E_0 = m_0 c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWhen the particle is accelerated through a potential difference $V$, it gains an energy $qV$, where $q$ is the charge of the particle. The total energy of the particle is then given by:\n\n$E = E_0 + qV$\n\nNow, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the total energy of the particle:\n\n$E^2 = (m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2$\n\nwhere $p$ is the relativistic momentum of the particle. We can rewrite this equation in terms of the kinetic energy $K$:\n\n$E = E_0 + K$\n\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation, we get:\n\n$(E_0 + K)^2 = (m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2$\n\nNow, we want to solve for the kinetic energy $K$. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$K = \\sqrt{(m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2} - E_0$\n\nSince the particle is accelerated through a potential difference $V$, we can substitute the energy gained by the particle, $qV$, for the kinetic energy $K$:\n\n$qV = \\sqrt{(m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2} - E_0$\n\nNow, we can solve for the relativistic kinetic energy $K$ in terms of the rest energy $E_0$:\n\n$K = qV + E_0 - \\sqrt{(m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2}$"
