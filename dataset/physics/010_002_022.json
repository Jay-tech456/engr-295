    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the water flowing through the pipe, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage velocity = Flow rate / Cross-sectional area of the pipe\n\nFirst, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The pipe has a diameter of 8 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 4 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we'll divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):\n\nRadius = 4 inches / 12 = 1/3 feet\n\nNow we can find the cross-sectional area of the pipe using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nArea = π * (radius)^2\nArea = π * (1/3 ft)^2\nArea ≈ 3.14159 * (1/9) ft^2\nArea ≈ 0.34898 ft^2\n\nNow we can find the average velocity:\n\nAverage velocity = Flow rate / Cross-sectional area\nAverage velocity = 0.1 ft³/s / 0.34898 ft²\nAverage velocity ≈ 0.28647 ft/s\n\nThe average velocity of the water flowing through the pipe is approximately 0.28647 feet per second."
