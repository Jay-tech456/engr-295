    "message_2": "To determine the image location, we can use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/di\n\n50 / 600 = 1/di\n\nNow we can solve for di:\n\ndi = 600 / 50\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image is located 12 cm away from the lens.\n\nNext, we can determine the image height using the magnification equation:\n\nM = hi/ho = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, hi is the image height, and ho is the object height. We don't have the object height, so let's assume it's h.\n\nM = -12/30 = -2/5\n\nSince the magnification is negative, the image is inverted. The image height (hi) is related to the object height (ho) by the magnification:\n\nhi = -2/5 * ho\n\nThe image height is 2/5 times the object height, and it is inverted.\n\nIn summary, the image is located 12 cm away from the lens, the image height is 2/5 times the object height, and the image is inverted."
