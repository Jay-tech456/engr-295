    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the scattering of two electrons via photon exchange is described by the process called Møller scattering. To calculate the cross-section up to the second order in perturbation theory, we need to consider the Feynman diagrams contributing to this process.\n\nAt the lowest (second) order in perturbation theory, there are two Feynman diagrams: one where the photon is exchanged in the t-channel and another where the photon is exchanged in the u-channel. The matrix element for the process can be written as:\n\nM = -e^2 (u_2 γ^μ u_1) (u_4 γ_μ u_3) D_μν (q) (-e^2) (v_1 γ^ν v_2)\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, u_i and v_i are the spinors for the incoming and outgoing electrons, γ^μ are the Dirac gamma matrices, and D_μν (q) is the photon propagator.\n\nTo calculate the cross-section, we need to square the matrix element and average over initial spins and sum over final spins:\n\n| M |^2 = (1/4) ∑_(spins) | M |^2\n\nNext, we need to integrate over the phase space of the final state particles:\n\ndσ = (1/2s) | M |^2 dΠ_2 dΠ_3\n\nwhere s is the Mandelstam variable (center-of-mass energy squared), and dΠ_i are the phase space factors for the final state particles.\n\nAfter performing the spin sums, phase space integrals, and some algebra, we obtain the differential cross-section for Møller scattering:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / 4s) (sin^4(θ/2) + cos^4(θ/2))^(-1)\n\nwhere α = e^2 / (4π) is the fine-structure constant, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nTo obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫ dσ/dΩ dΩ\n\nPerforming this integration, we find the total cross-section for Møller scattering up to the second order in perturbation theory:\n\nσ = (4πα^2 / s) (2π / 3)\n\nThis is the result for the cross-section of two electrons scattering via photon exchange in a quantum field theory framework up to the second order in perturbation theory."
