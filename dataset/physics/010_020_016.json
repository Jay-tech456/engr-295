    "message_1": "A student is trying to pour a non-Newtonian fluid from a container onto a flat surface. The fluid appears to have a consistency that is similar to ketchup, where it flows less easily when a force is applied slowly, but becomes more liquid-like when a stronger force is applied. The student wants to determine the shear rate and shear stress required to pour the fluid onto the surface without it splattering or becoming stuck to the container. Using the data provided in the fluid's material safety data sheet, calculate the necessary shear rate and shear stress for the student to successfully pour the fluid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the necessary shear rate and shear stress for the student to successfully pour the non-Newtonian fluid, we need to know the specific rheological properties of the fluid. These properties can be found in the fluid's material safety data sheet (MSDS). However, you have not provided the data from the MSDS.\n\nNon-Newtonian fluids like the one described in the problem can be modeled using the power-law model, which is given by the equation:\n\nτ = K * (du/dy)^n\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, K is the consistency index, du/dy is the shear rate, and n is the flow behavior index. The values of K and n can be found in the MSDS.\n\nOnce you provide the values of K and n from the MSDS, we can proceed with the calculations to determine the necessary shear rate and shear stress for the student to pour the fluid without splattering or becoming stuck to the container."
