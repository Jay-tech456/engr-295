    "message_2": "For an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant. The work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2 moles\nR = 8.31 J/mol*K\nT = 300 K\nVi = 3 L\nVf = 6 L\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nW = (2 moles) * (8.31 J/mol*K) * (300 K) * ln(6 L / 3 L)\n\nW = (2 moles) * (8.31 J/mol*K) * (300 K) * ln(2)\n\nW = 16.62 J/mol * 300 K * 0.6931\n\nW = 3453.18 J * 0.6931\n\nW â‰ˆ 2392.24 J\n\nThe work done by the gas during this isothermal expansion is approximately 2392.24 Joules."
