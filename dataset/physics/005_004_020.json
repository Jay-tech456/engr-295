    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we first need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.8c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy using the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the student (70 kg) and c is the speed of light.\n\nK = (1.6667 - 1) * 70 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK = 0.6667 * 70 kg * (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 4.2 * 10^18 J\n\nSo, the student's relativistic kinetic energy is approximately 4.2 x 10^18 Joules."
