    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment, conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, provides evidence for the quantization of energy levels in an atom by demonstrating the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms through the inelastic collisions between electrons and mercury atoms.\n\nIn the experiment, a heated cathode emits electrons, which are then accelerated by an electric field towards a grid. The electrons gain kinetic energy from the electric field and collide with mercury atoms in a vapor-filled tube. If the kinetic energy of the electron is sufficient, it can excite the mercury atom by transferring a specific amount of energy to the atom, causing the electron in the atom to jump to a higher energy level. This process is called inelastic collision.\n\nAfter the collision, the electron loses its kinetic energy and is no longer attracted to the grid. Instead, it is repelled by a second electric field and collected by a nearby electrode. The current produced by the collected electrons is measured, and the accelerating voltage is varied.\n\nThe experiment shows that the current increases with the accelerating voltage until it reaches a specific value, at which point the current suddenly drops. This drop corresponds to the energy required to excite the mercury atom. As the voltage is further increased, the current increases again until it reaches another specific value, where it drops again. These drops in current occur at regular intervals, indicating that the energy required to excite the mercury atoms is quantized, meaning it can only take on specific, discrete values.\n\nThis observation supports the idea that energy levels in atoms are quantized, as proposed by Niels Bohr in his atomic model. The Franck-Hertz experiment provided experimental evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms and was a significant step in the development of quantum mechanics. Franck and Hertz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1925 for their discovery."
