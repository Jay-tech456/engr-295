    "message_2": "To estimate the expected signal rate of dark matter particles in a direct detection experiment, we need to consider several factors, such as the local dark matter density, the dark matter mass, the target material's mass, and the cross-section of the interaction between dark matter particles and the target nuclei. \n\nLet's assume the local dark matter density is ρ = 0.3 GeV/c²/cm³, as given. We also need to know the velocity distribution of dark matter particles, which is typically assumed to follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with a characteristic velocity of v₀ = 220 km/s and an escape velocity of v_esc = 544 km/s in the galactic frame. We also need to consider the Earth's velocity relative to the dark matter halo, which is about v_E = 232 km/s.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases: \n\n1. Dark matter mass m₁ = 100 GeV/c²\n2. Dark matter mass m₂ = 1000 GeV/c²\n\nThe number density of dark matter particles for each case can be calculated as:\n\nn₁ = ρ / m₁\nn₂ = ρ / m₂\n\nThe differential interaction rate per unit target mass can be expressed as:\n\ndR/dE = n * σ * v\n\nwhere E is the recoil energy, σ is the interaction cross-section, and v is the relative velocity between the dark matter particle and the target nucleus.\n\nTo estimate the signal rate, we need to integrate this differential rate over the energy range of interest and multiply it by the target mass. However, without information about the interaction cross-section and the target material, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the signal rate.\n\nRegarding the change in the signal rate when the dark matter mass is increased from 100 GeV/c² to 1000 GeV/c², we can make a qualitative statement. Since the number density of dark matter particles is inversely proportional to the dark matter mass, increasing the mass will decrease the number density, which in turn will decrease the signal rate. However, the actual change in the signal rate will depend on the specific interaction cross-section and the target material."
