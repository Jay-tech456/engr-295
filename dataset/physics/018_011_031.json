    "message_2": "To calculate the expected number of high-energy cosmic neutrino interactions per year in a detector, we can use the following formula:\n\nN = Flux × Cross-section × Volume × Time\n\nwhere N is the number of interactions, Flux is the neutrino flux, Cross-section is the interaction cross-section, Volume is the detector volume, and Time is the observation time.\n\nGiven values:\nFlux = 1 neutrino/km²/year\nCross-section = 10⁻³⁹ cm²\nVolume = 1 km³\nTime = 1 year\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units to be consistent. We'll convert the volume from km³ to cm³ and the flux from neutrinos/km²/year to neutrinos/cm²/year.\n\n1 km³ = (10⁵ cm/km)³ = 10¹⁵ cm³\n\n1 neutrino/km²/year = 1 neutrino/(10⁵ cm/km)²/year = 1 neutrino/10¹⁰ cm²/year\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nN = (1 neutrino/10¹⁰ cm²/year) × (10⁻³⁹ cm²) × (10¹⁵ cm³) × (1 year)\n\nN = 10⁻²⁴ neutrinos/year\n\nThe expected number of high-energy cosmic neutrino interactions per year in a detector with a volume of 1 km³ is approximately 10⁻²⁴ neutrinos/year. This is an extremely small number, indicating that detecting high-energy cosmic neutrinos is a very rare event."
