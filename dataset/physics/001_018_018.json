    "message_2": "To determine the maximum key transmission distance for a quantum key distribution (QKD) system using single photon communication, we need to consider the factors that limit the transmission distance. In this case, we are given perfect communication channels and a decoherence time of 1 ns. \n\nThe decoherence time is the time it takes for a quantum state to lose its coherence due to interaction with the environment. In a QKD system, this means that after the decoherence time, the quantum state of the photon cannot be reliably used for secure key distribution.\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second (m/s). To find the maximum distance the photon can travel before decoherence occurs, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed × time\n\nIn this case, the speed is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and the time is the decoherence time (1 ns, which is 1 x 10^-9 seconds).\n\ndistance = (3 x 10^8 m/s) × (1 x 10^-9 s)\n\ndistance = 3 x 10^-1 meters\n\ndistance = 0.3 meters\n\nSo, the maximum key transmission distance for a quantum key distribution system using single photon communication between two points, assuming perfect communication channels and a decoherence time of 1 ns, is 0.3 meters."
