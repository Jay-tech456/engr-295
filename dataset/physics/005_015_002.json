    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the proton, we can use the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1.67 × 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.99c\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v in terms of m/s:\nv = 0.99 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.97 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic mass:\n\nm = 1.67 × 10^-27 kg / sqrt(1 - (2.97 × 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2)\nm ≈ 1.67 × 10^-27 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.9801)\nm ≈ 1.67 × 10^-27 kg / sqrt(0.0199)\nm ≈ 1.67 × 10^-27 kg / 0.1411\nm ≈ 1.183 × 10^-26 kg\n\nNow, let's calculate the relativistic kinetic energy using the following equation:\n\nK = (m - m0)c^2\n\nK = (1.183 × 10^-26 kg - 1.67 × 10^-27 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ (1.016 × 10^-26 kg) × 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nK ≈ 9.144 × 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton is approximately 1.183 × 10^-26 kg, and the relativistic kinetic energy gained by the proton is approximately 9.144 × 10^-10 J."
