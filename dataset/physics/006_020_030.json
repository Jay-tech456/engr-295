    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section, we need to use the Mott formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε₀))^2 * (1 / (4 * E * sin^2(θ/2))) * (1 - β^2 * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\ndσ/dΩ is the differential cross section,\nZ is the atomic number of the target nucleus (for helium, Z = 2),\ne is the elementary charge (e = 1.602 × 10^(-19) C),\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (ε₀ = 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/N·m²),\nE is the energy of the incoming electron (100 eV = 100 * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J),\nθ is the scattering angle (30 degrees),\nβ is the ratio of the electron speed to the speed of light (β = v/c).\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of the incoming electron (v) using its energy (E) and mass (m_e = 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg):\n\nE = 0.5 * m_e * v^2\nv = sqrt(2 * E / m_e)\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 100 * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J / 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg) ≈ 1.875 × 10^6 m/s\n\nNow, we can find β:\n\nβ = v / c\nβ = 1.875 × 10^6 m/s / 2.998 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 0.00625\n\nNext, we can plug all the values into the Mott formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (2 * 1.602 × 10^(-19) C / (4 * π * 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/N·m²))^2 * (1 / (4 * 100 * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J * sin^2(30/2))) * (1 - 0.00625^2 * sin^2(30/2))\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (2.82 × 10^(-29) m²)^2 * (1 / (6.451 × 10^(-18) J * 0.25)) * (1 - 0.00009766)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 7.94 × 10^(-58) m² / (1.613 × 10^(-18) J) * 0.99990234\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 3.93 × 10^(-40) m²/sr\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom with an incoming electron of energy 100 eV and a scattering angle of 30 degrees is approximately 3.93 × 10^(-40) m²/sr."
