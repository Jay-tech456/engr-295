    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 3 cm away from the axis of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid, which is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the coil is helical, we can assume that the turns are uniformly distributed along the axis. Let's assume the length of the coil is L. Then, n = N / L, where N is the total number of turns (20 turns).\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a point 3 cm away from the axis of the coil. To do this, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid at a radial distance r from its axis:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ * n * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the coil (5 cm), r is the radial distance from the axis (3 cm), and I is the current (5 A).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB(r) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * (20 / L) * 5 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.03 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB(r) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * (100 / L) * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.0009 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB(r) = (π × 10⁻⁵ Tm²/A * (100 / L)) / (2 * (0.0034 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB(r) ≈ (3.14 × 10⁻⁵ Tm²/A * (100 / L)) / (2 * 0.0101 m³)\n\nB(r) ≈ (3.14 × 10⁻³ T/A * (100 / L)) / 0.0202\n\nB(r) ≈ (0.314 T * (100 / L)) / 0.0202\n\nSince the coil is long enough such that its ends can be neglected, the magnetic field at a point 3 cm away from the axis of the coil will be approximately:\n\nB(r) ≈ (15.52 T * (100 / L))\n\nTo find the exact value of the magnetic field, we would need to know the length of the coil (L)."
