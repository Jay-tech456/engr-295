    "message_2": "Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a black hole, bends the path of light due to its strong gravitational field. This effect is a direct consequence of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which states that massive objects can curve spacetime around them.\n\nAs light approaches a black hole, the gravitational field of the black hole causes the light to follow a curved path. This curvature can cause the light to be focused or defocused, depending on the alignment between the light source, the black hole, and the observer. In some cases, the light can even be bent so much that it forms a complete loop around the black hole, creating a phenomenon known as an \"Einstein ring.\"\n\nGravitational lensing can also cause multiple images of the same object to appear, as light from the object takes different paths around the black hole before reaching the observer. The images can be distorted, magnified, or demagnified, depending on the specific geometry of the lensing situation.\n\nIn the case of a black hole, the gravitational lensing effect becomes more pronounced as the light gets closer to the event horizon, which is the point of no return beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. At the event horizon, the gravitational field is so strong that light is bent into a closed orbit, and any light that crosses the event horizon is lost forever.\n\nIn summary, gravitational lensing caused by a black hole can result in the bending of light, the formation of multiple images, and the distortion and magnification of those images. As light gets closer to the event horizon, the lensing effects become more extreme, ultimately leading to the capture of light by the black hole itself."
