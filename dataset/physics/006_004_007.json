    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the Stark effect, which describes the splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. For the hydrogen atom, the linear Stark effect can be applied to the Balmer series.\n\nThe linear Stark effect states that the energy shift ΔE due to an electric field E is given by:\n\nΔE = -e * d * E\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), d is the electric dipole moment, and E is the electric field.\n\nFor the Balmer series, the energy difference between adjacent levels is given by:\n\nΔE₀ = 13.6 eV * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)\n\nwhere n₁ and n₂ are the principal quantum numbers of the lower and upper energy levels, respectively, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nWe are given that the splitting factor is 2.5 times the original spacing, so the energy shift due to the electric field is:\n\nΔE = 2.5 * ΔE₀\n\nNow, we need to find the electric dipole moment, d. For the hydrogen atom in the Balmer series, the dipole moment can be approximated as:\n\nd ≈ a₀ * n₂\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius (5.29 × 10^(-11) m) and n₂ is the principal quantum number of the upper energy level.\n\nSince we are dealing with the Balmer series, n₁ = 2. The first line in the Balmer series corresponds to n₂ = 3. Now we can calculate the energy difference between these levels:\n\nΔE₀ = 13.6 eV * (1/2² - 1/3²) ≈ 1.89 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy shift due to the electric field:\n\nΔE = 2.5 * ΔE₀ ≈ 4.73 eV\n\nNext, we can find the electric dipole moment for n₂ = 3:\n\nd ≈ a₀ * n₂ ≈ 5.29 × 10^(-11) m * 3 ≈ 1.59 × 10^(-10) m\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the electric field E:\n\nE = ΔE / (-e * d) ≈ 4.73 eV / (-1.6 × 10^(-19) C * 1.59 × 10^(-10) m) ≈ -1.85 × 10^8 V/m\n\nThe direction of the electric field should be opposite to the direction of the electric dipole moment to cause the splitting of the spectral lines. Since the dipole moment points from the lower energy level (n₁) to the higher energy level (n₂), the electric field should point from the higher energy level to the lower energy level.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the electric field required to cause a splitting of the spectral lines in the hydrogen atom's Balmer series by a factor of 2.5 times their original spacing is 1.85 × 10^8 V/m, and the direction should be from the higher energy level to the lower energy level."
