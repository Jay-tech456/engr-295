    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a straight conductor carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, for a simpler approach, we can use Ampere's Law in the form of the formula for the magnetic field around a long straight conductor:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A),\nI is the current in the conductor (5 A),\nr is the distance from the conductor to the point in space (0.1 m, since we need to convert 10 cm to meters).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB = 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the straight conductor carrying a current of 5 A and located 10 cm away from a point in space is 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
