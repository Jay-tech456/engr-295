    "message_2": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical framework in high-energy physics that aims to address the hierarchy problem, which is the large discrepancy between the electroweak scale (around 100 GeV) and the Planck scale (around 10^19 GeV). This huge gap between the two scales raises the question of why the Higgs boson mass, which is responsible for giving particles mass through the Higgs mechanism, is not much larger due to quantum corrections.\n\nThe hierarchy problem arises because the Higgs boson mass receives large quantum corrections from the virtual particles in the loop diagrams. These corrections depend on the masses of the particles in the loops, and without any additional structure, they would naturally drive the Higgs mass to a much higher value, close to the Planck scale. This is in stark contrast to the observed Higgs mass of around 125 GeV.\n\nSupersymmetry addresses this problem by introducing a symmetry between fermions (particles with half-integer spin) and bosons (particles with integer spin). In SUSY, every Standard Model particle has a corresponding superpartner with a spin differing by 1/2. These superpartners have not yet been observed, but their existence is postulated to cancel out the large quantum corrections to the Higgs mass.\n\nIn supersymmetric models, the quantum corrections from the Standard Model particles and their superpartners cancel each other out, preventing the Higgs mass from being driven to a much higher value. This cancellation is a result of the symmetry between fermions and bosons, which ensures that their contributions to the Higgs mass have opposite signs.\n\nHowever, for this cancellation to be effective, the superpartner masses should not be too far from the electroweak scale. This implies that if supersymmetry is the solution to the hierarchy problem, we should expect to find superpartners with masses not much higher than the electroweak scale. So far, experimental searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have not found any evidence for supersymmetric particles, which has put constraints on the parameter space of SUSY models and raised questions about the viability of SUSY as a solution to the hierarchy problem.\n\nIn summary, supersymmetry addresses the hierarchy problem by introducing a symmetry between fermions and bosons, which leads to a cancellation of the large quantum corrections to the Higgs mass. This keeps the Higgs mass stable at the electroweak scale and prevents it from being driven to a much higher value. However, the experimental search for supersymmetric particles is still ongoing, and their discovery would provide crucial evidence for the validity of SUSY as a solution to the hierarchy problem."
