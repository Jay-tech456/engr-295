    "message_1": "A double-slit apparatus has a slit separation of 0.25 mm and a distance of 1 m from the screen. A laser beam with a wavelength of 633 nm is incident normally on the slits. What is the distance between the central bright fringe and the third bright fringe on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central bright fringe and the third bright fringe on the screen, we can use the formula for the position of bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\n- y is the distance from the central bright fringe to the m-th bright fringe\n- m is the order of the bright fringe (m = 0 for the central bright fringe, m = 1 for the first bright fringe, etc.)\n- λ is the wavelength of the light (in this case, 633 nm or 633 * 10^(-9) m)\n- L is the distance from the slits to the screen (1 m)\n- d is the slit separation (0.25 mm or 0.25 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nWe want to find the distance between the central bright fringe (m = 0) and the third bright fringe (m = 3). First, let's find the position of the third bright fringe (m = 3):\n\ny_3 = (3 * 633 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\ny_3 ≈ 0.007596 m\n\nSince the central bright fringe (m = 0) is at y = 0, the distance between the central bright fringe and the third bright fringe is simply y_3:\n\ndistance = y_3 ≈ 0.007596 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central bright fringe and the third bright fringe on the screen is approximately 0.007596 meters, or 7.596 mm."
