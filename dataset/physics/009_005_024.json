    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the image distance (di) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo find di, we can first find the common denominator (60):\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 2/60 from both sides:\n\n1/60 = 1/di\n\nThus, di = 60 cm.\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the mirror is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object."
