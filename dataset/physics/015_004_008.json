    "message_1": "What is the estimated total energy released in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion if the event occurred approximately 50 million light-years away and we observed its effects on Earth? Assume the supernova was a Type II core-collapse and had a mass of 20 solar masses at the time of the explosion.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the total energy released in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy released in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the supernova (in kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the supernova to the observer (in meters).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the supernova from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 20 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from light-years to meters. One light-year is approximately 9.461 x 10^15 meters, so:\n\nR = 50 million light-years * (9.461 x 10^15 m/light-year) = 4.7305 x 10^23 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.7305 x 10^23 m)\nE â‰ˆ 2.00 x 10^46 Joules\n\nSo, the estimated total energy released in gravitational waves by the supernova explosion is approximately 2.00 x 10^46 Joules. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, as the actual energy released in gravitational waves can vary depending on the specific details of the supernova event."
