    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between a cold reservoir at 10°C and a warm reservoir at 40°C. The heat pump transfers heat to the warm reservoir at a rate of 500 J/s while consuming 2.5 kW of power from the electrical supply. What is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the warm reservoir (Q_w) to the work input (W) from the electrical supply.\n\nCOP = Q_w / W\n\nGiven that the heat pump transfers heat to the warm reservoir at a rate of 500 J/s and consumes 2.5 kW of power from the electrical supply, we can calculate the COP.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the power consumption from kW to J/s:\n\n2.5 kW = 2.5 * 1000 W = 2500 J/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the COP:\n\nCOP = Q_w / W = 500 J/s / 2500 J/s = 0.2\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 0.2."
