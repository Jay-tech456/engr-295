    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of a gas mixture, we can use the following formula:\n\nCp (mixture) = Σ xi * Cp (individual gas)\n\nwhere Cp (mixture) is the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture, xi is the mole fraction of each individual gas, and Cp (individual gas) is the specific heat capacity of each individual gas.\n\nFirst, let's find the specific heat capacity of each individual gas at constant pressure (Cp) in J/(mol*K):\n\n1. Nitrogen (N2): Cp (N2) = 29.12 J/(mol*K)\n2. Oxygen (O2): Cp (O2) = 29.38 J/(mol*K)\n3. Carbon dioxide (CO2): Cp (CO2) = 37.11 J/(mol*K)\n\nNow, let's find the mole fraction of each gas in the mixture:\n\n1. Nitrogen (N2): 40% = 0.40\n2. Oxygen (O2): 50% = 0.50\n3. Carbon dioxide (CO2): 10% = 0.10\n\nNow, we can calculate the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture using the formula:\n\nCp (mixture) = Σ xi * Cp (individual gas)\n\nCp (mixture) = (0.40 * 29.12) + (0.50 * 29.38) + (0.10 * 37.11)\nCp (mixture) = 11.648 + 14.69 + 3.711\nCp (mixture) = 30.049 J/(mol*K)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture at 298 K and 1 atm is approximately 30.049 J/(mol*K)."
