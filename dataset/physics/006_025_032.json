    "message_2": "The energy released in the nuclear fission of a uranium-235 nucleus can be calculated using the mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc²) and the mass defect of the fission reaction. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the uranium-235 nucleus and the combined mass of the fission products (two daughter nuclei, gamma rays, and neutrons).\n\nThe energy released in a single fission event of uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts), which is equivalent to 3.2 × 10^(-11) joules. This value includes the kinetic energy of the fission fragments (two daughter nuclei), the energy of the emitted gamma rays, and the energy of the released neutrons.\n\nIt's important to note that the energy released per fission event can vary depending on the specific fission products and their distribution. However, the value of 200 MeV is a commonly used average for the energy released in the fission of uranium-235."
