    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the activity coefficient of a solution that contains 0.1 mole fraction of benzene and 0.9 mole fraction of toluene at 25 degrees Celsius. Given that the activity coefficients of pure benzene and pure toluene at the same temperature are 0.6 and 0.7 respectively, calculate the activity coefficient of the mixture.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of the mixture, we can use the mole fraction weighted average method. This method involves multiplying the activity coefficient of each component by its mole fraction and then summing the results.\n\nActivity coefficient of the mixture (γ_mix) = (mole fraction of benzene × activity coefficient of benzene) + (mole fraction of toluene × activity coefficient of toluene)\n\nGiven:\nMole fraction of benzene (x_benzene) = 0.1\nMole fraction of toluene (x_toluene) = 0.9\nActivity coefficient of pure benzene (γ_benzene) = 0.6\nActivity coefficient of pure toluene (γ_toluene) = 0.7\n\nNow, let's calculate the activity coefficient of the mixture:\n\nγ_mix = (x_benzene × γ_benzene) + (x_toluene × γ_toluene)\nγ_mix = (0.1 × 0.6) + (0.9 × 0.7)\nγ_mix = 0.06 + 0.63\nγ_mix = 0.69\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of the mixture is 0.69."
