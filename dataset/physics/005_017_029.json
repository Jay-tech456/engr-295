    "message_1": "A particle is moving in a straight line with a velocity of 0.9c. What is the trajectory of the particle as observed from a stationary observer?",
    "message_2": "Since the particle is moving in a straight line with a velocity of 0.9c (where c is the speed of light), its trajectory as observed from a stationary observer will also be a straight line. The particle's motion will be along the same direction as its velocity vector, and the observer will see the particle moving at a speed of 0.9c in that direction."
