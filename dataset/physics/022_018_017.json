    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are one of the proposed candidates for dark matter in our Milky Way galaxy. They are non-luminous, massive objects that could be present in the galactic halo. Some potential candidates for MACHOs include black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and white dwarfs.\n\nTo estimate the fraction of dark matter in our Milky Way galaxy that could be composed of MACHOs, we can refer to the results of microlensing surveys, such as the MACHO Project, EROS, and OGLE. These surveys have searched for MACHOs by observing the gravitational microlensing effect they cause on background stars.\n\nThe MACHO Project, for instance, found that MACHOs with masses between 0.1 and 1 solar mass could account for about 20% of the dark matter in the Milky Way's halo. However, other studies, such as the EROS and OGLE surveys, have placed tighter constraints on the MACHO contribution, suggesting that they could account for less than 10% of the dark matter in the halo.\n\nBased on these results, the estimated fraction of dark matter in our Milky Way galaxy that could be composed of MACHOs is likely less than 10%. However, it is important to note that these estimates are subject to uncertainties and depend on the assumptions made in the surveys.\n\nIn summary, while MACHOs could contribute to the dark matter content of our Milky Way galaxy, they are unlikely to account for the majority of it. Other dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions, are still being investigated as potential explanations for the majority of the dark matter in the universe."
