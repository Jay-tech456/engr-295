    "message_1": "What is the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with masses of 10 solar masses and 25 solar masses at a distance of 500 megaparsecs from the Earth?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of the gravitational wave\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\nM = total mass of the binary black hole system (in kg)\nω = angular frequency of the binary system (in rad/s)\nr = distance from the binary system to the Earth (in meters)\nc = speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\n10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg\n25 solar masses = 25 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 4.9725 × 10³¹ kg\n\nThe total mass of the binary black hole system is:\n\nM = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg + 4.9725 × 10³¹ kg = 6.9615 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency of the binary system. This can be approximated using the following formula:\n\nω ≈ (G * M / a³)^(1/2)\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the binary system. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the semi-major axis or the angular frequency. Therefore, we cannot proceed further with the calculation of the amplitude of the gravitational waves.\n\nIf we had the semi-major axis or the angular frequency, we could then convert the distance from megaparsecs to meters and plug all the values into the formula to find the amplitude of the gravitational waves."
