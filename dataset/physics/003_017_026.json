    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, we can find the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and then multiply it by 4 to account for all sides. Let's consider one side of the square loop with length L = 10 cm = 0.1 m. The current I = 2 A.\n\nWe can divide the side into small segments (dl) and integrate the magnetic field contributions from each segment. However, due to symmetry, the vertical components of the magnetic field from the segments on the opposite sides of the square will cancel each other out, leaving only the horizontal components. Thus, we only need to consider the horizontal components of the magnetic field.\n\nLet's consider a small segment dl at a distance x from the center of the side. The distance from this segment to the center of the square is r = √((L/2 - x)² + (L/2)²). The angle between dl and r is θ, where tan(θ) = (L/2 - x) / (L/2). The horizontal component of the magnetic field dBx due to this segment is:\n\ndBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / r³\n\nIntegrating dBx over the length of the side from x = 0 to x = L, we get the magnetic field due to one side:\n\nB_side = ∫(dBx) from 0 to L\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the square loop by multiplying B_side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nTo find the exact value of B_total, we can use numerical integration methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. However, this calculation is quite complex and usually requires a computer or calculator to perform the integration.\n\nFor the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. Curl your right hand in the direction of the current, and your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. Since the current is flowing in a square loop, the magnetic field at the center will be pointing either into or out of the loop, depending on the direction of the current flow."
