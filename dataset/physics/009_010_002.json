    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the image distance (di) using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 15 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator (30) and rewrite the equation:\n\n2/30 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find di by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values for di and do:\n\nM = -30/30\n\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
