    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the steel ball, we first need to find the volume of the submerged part of the ball and the mass of the water displaced by the ball. \n\nLet's first find the volume of the steel ball (V_ball):\n\nV_ball = (4/3) * π * r^3\nV_ball = (4/3) * π * (0.1 m)^3\nV_ball ≈ 0.00419 m³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the steel ball (m_ball):\n\nm_ball = density_ball * V_ball\nm_ball = 7800 kg/m³ * 0.00419 m³\nm_ball ≈ 32.68 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the submerged part of the ball (V_submerged). Since the ball is denser than water, it will sink until it displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³.\n\nLet's find the mass of the water displaced by the ball (m_water):\n\nm_water = m_ball\nm_water = 32.68 kg\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the submerged part of the ball (V_submerged):\n\nV_submerged = m_water / density_water\nV_submerged = 32.68 kg / 1000 kg/m³\nV_submerged ≈ 0.03268 m³\n\nNow we can find the buoyant force (F_buoyant) acting on the steel ball:\n\nF_buoyant = m_water * g\nF_buoyant = 32.68 kg * 9.81 m/s²\nF_buoyant ≈ 320.5 N\n\nNow, let's find the depth to which the ball will sink in water. Since the ball is denser than water, it will sink until it displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight. We already found the volume of the submerged part of the ball (V_submerged). We can use this to find the depth (h) to which the ball will sink in water:\n\nV_submerged = (4/3) * π * r^3 * (h / (2 * r))\n0.03268 m³ = (4/3) * π * (0.1 m)^3 * (h / (2 * 0.1 m))\n\nSolving for h:\n\nh ≈ 1.56\n\nSince the height of the water in the container is 1.2 m, the ball will sink to the bottom of the container and be completely submerged. The depth to which the ball will sink in water is 1.2 m."
