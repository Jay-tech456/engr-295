    "message_2": "The angular momentum of a collapsing interstellar cloud plays a crucial role in the formation and rotational dynamics of a protoplanetary disk around a newborn star. Angular momentum is a measure of the rotational motion of an object, and in the context of a collapsing interstellar cloud, it is a conserved quantity. This means that as the cloud collapses, its total angular momentum remains constant.\n\n1. Formation of the protoplanetary disk: As the interstellar cloud collapses under its own gravity, it begins to rotate faster due to the conservation of angular momentum. This is similar to how an ice skater spins faster when they pull their arms closer to their body. As the cloud's rotation rate increases, it starts to flatten into a disk-like structure, which is the protoplanetary disk. This disk is where the material for forming planets and other celestial bodies is found.\n\n2. Rotational dynamics of the protoplanetary disk: The angular momentum of the collapsing cloud determines the rotational dynamics of the protoplanetary disk. The disk rotates around the central newborn star, with material in the disk orbiting the star at different speeds depending on its distance from the star. The inner regions of the disk, closer to the star, rotate faster than the outer regions due to the conservation of angular momentum.\n\nThe distribution of angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk has significant implications for the formation of planets and other celestial bodies:\n\na) Formation of planets: The differential rotation in the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of local density enhancements and instabilities. These density enhancements can eventually lead to the formation of planetesimals, which are the building blocks of planets. The angular momentum of the collapsing cloud, therefore, influences the distribution of planetesimals and the eventual formation of planets in the disk.\n\nb) Orbital dynamics of planets: The angular momentum of the collapsing cloud also affects the orbital dynamics of the planets that form in the protoplanetary disk. Planets that form closer to the star will have higher angular momentum and will, therefore, orbit the star faster than planets that form farther out in the disk.\n\nIn summary, the angular momentum of a collapsing interstellar cloud is a key factor in the formation and rotational dynamics of a protoplanetary disk around a newborn star. It influences the disk's structure, the formation of planets, and their orbital dynamics."
