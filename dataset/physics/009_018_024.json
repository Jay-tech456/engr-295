    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the bright fringes on the screen are formed due to constructive interference of light waves from the two slits. The position of these bright fringes can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance from the central bright fringe to the m-th bright fringe\nm = order of the bright fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 2 for the second bright fringe, and so on)\nλ = wavelength of the light (600 nm)\nL = distance from the slits to the screen (1 m)\nd = distance between the slits (0.2 mm)\n\nFirst, let's convert the units to meters:\n\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\nd = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we'll calculate the position of the first (m = 1) and second (m = 2) bright fringes:\n\ny1 = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\ny1 ≈ 3 * 10^(-3) m\n\ny2 = (2 * 600 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\ny2 ≈ 6 * 10^(-3) m\n\nFinally, we'll find the distance between the first and second bright fringes:\n\nDistance = y2 - y1\nDistance ≈ 6 * 10^(-3) - 3 * 10^(-3)\nDistance ≈ 3 * 10^(-3) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen is approximately 3 mm."
