    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at 0.6c relative to the Earth. An observer on the spaceship releases a small ball with a velocity of 0.4c relative to the spaceship. What is the velocity of the ball relative to the Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is:\n\nV_rel = (V1 + V2) / (1 + (V1 * V2) / c^2)\n\nwhere V_rel is the relative velocity of the ball with respect to Earth, V1 is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth (0.6c), V2 is the velocity of the ball relative to the spaceship (0.4c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nV_rel = (0.6c + 0.4c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.4c) / c^2)\n\nV_rel = (1c) / (1 + 0.24)\n\nV_rel = 1c / 1.24\n\nV_rel â‰ˆ 0.80645c\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball relative to the Earth is approximately 0.80645c."
