    "message_2": "The thermal conductivity of a material is its ability to conduct heat. It depends on the material's composition and structure, as well as the temperature range in question. In the temperature range of -50°C to 150°C, the thermal conductivity of a material can change in various ways depending on the specific material.\n\nFor most metals, thermal conductivity increases with temperature. This is because the lattice vibrations (phonons) and free electrons, which are responsible for heat conduction in metals, become more energetic as the temperature rises. However, the rate of increase in thermal conductivity may not be linear and can vary depending on the metal.\n\nFor non-metallic materials, such as ceramics, polymers, and insulators, the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature is more complex. In some cases, thermal conductivity may increase with temperature due to increased phonon vibrations. In other cases, it may decrease due to factors such as increased phonon scattering or changes in the material's structure.\n\nIn general, the thermal conductivity of a material in the temperature range of -50°C to 150°C will depend on the specific material and its properties. To determine the exact relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature for a given material, it is necessary to consult experimental data or perform calculations using appropriate theoretical models."
