    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the signal received by the spaceship's radio, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the spaceship is moving towards the Earth, which is the source of the radio signal.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler effect formula is given by:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f' is the observed frequency by the spaceship, f is the emitted frequency by the Earth's radio station (1 GHz), and β is the ratio of the spaceship's speed (v) to the speed of light (c).\n\nIn this problem, the spaceship is moving at a speed of 0.8c, so β = 0.8.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf' = 1 GHz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\nf' = 1 GHz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\nf' = 1 GHz * sqrt(9)\nf' = 1 GHz * 3\n\nf' = 3 GHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the signal received by the spaceship's radio is 3 GHz. Note that the speed of sound in space is not relevant to this problem, as radio waves are electromagnetic waves and travel at the speed of light, not the speed of sound."
