    "message_2": "To determine the critical magnetic field strength (Hc) required to disrupt the superconductivity of a specific material at a given temperature, you can use the following formula:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere:\n- Hc(T) is the critical magnetic field strength at temperature T\n- Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field strength at absolute zero (0 K)\n- T is the given temperature\n- Tc is the critical temperature at which the material transitions from a superconductor to a normal conductor\n\nTo use this formula, you'll need to know the material's critical temperature (Tc) and its critical magnetic field strength at absolute zero (Hc(0)). These values are specific to each superconducting material and can be found in reference materials or scientific literature. Once you have these values, you can plug them into the formula along with the given temperature (T) to calculate the critical magnetic field strength required to disrupt the material's superconductivity."
