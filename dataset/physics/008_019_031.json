    "message_2": "The probability of a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons is given by the branching ratio, which is the ratio of the decay width of the Higgs boson to W boson pair (Γ(H→WW)) to the total decay width of the Higgs boson (Γ(H)).\n\nThe branching ratio for Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons is approximately 21.5% for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, which is the mass of the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC.\n\nThe production rate of Higgs bosons at the LHC can be compared with the experimentally observed values in different production modes. The main production modes for Higgs bosons at the LHC are:\n\n1. Gluon-gluon fusion (ggF)\n2. Vector boson fusion (VBF)\n3. Associated production with a W or Z boson (WH, ZH)\n4. Associated production with top quarks (ttH)\n\nThe predicted production rates for these modes are:\n\n1. ggF: ~89%\n2. VBF: ~7%\n3. WH, ZH: ~3%\n4. ttH: ~1%\n\nThe experimentally observed values at the LHC are in good agreement with these predicted values within the experimental uncertainties. The observed signal strengths (μ) for the different production modes, which are the ratios of the observed production rates to the predicted production rates, are close to 1, indicating a good match between the theoretical predictions and experimental observations.\n\nFor example, the combined signal strength for the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons in all production modes, as measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, is approximately 1.0 ± 0.1, which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction."
