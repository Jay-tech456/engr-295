    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT * ln(T2/T1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the change in entropy, m is the mass of the copper block, c is the specific heat capacity of copper, ΔT is the change in temperature, T1 is the initial temperature, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 500 g\nc = 0.385 J/g°C\nT1 = 20°C\nT2 = 120°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 120°C - 20°C\nΔT = 100°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (500 g)(0.385 J/g°C)(100°C) * ln(120°C/20°C)\nΔS = 19250 J°C * ln(6)\nΔS ≈ 19250 J°C * 1.792\nΔS ≈ 34518 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the copper block is approximately 34,518 J/K."
