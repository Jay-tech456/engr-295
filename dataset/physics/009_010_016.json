    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the lens, we first need to determine the image distance (v) using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (focal length)\nu = 30 cm (object distance)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 600 / 50\nv = 12 cm (image distance)\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = v / u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = 12 cm / 30 cm\nM = 0.4\n\nSo, the magnification of the image formed by the lens is 0.4."
