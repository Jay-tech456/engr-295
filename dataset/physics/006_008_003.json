    "message_1": "A metal has a work function of 2.3 eV. When illuminated with a certain color light, electrons are emitted with a kinetic energy of 1.8 eV. What is the frequency and wavelength of the incident light?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE_photon = E_kinetic + Work function\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, E_kinetic is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, and the work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy of the incident photon:\n\nE_photon = E_kinetic + Work function\nE_photon = 1.8 eV + 2.3 eV\nE_photon = 4.1 eV\n\nNow, we can convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J:\n\nE_photon (J) = 4.1 eV * 1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV\nE_photon (J) = 6.5682 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNext, we can use the Planck's equation to find the frequency of the incident light:\n\nE_photon = h * f\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) and f is the frequency.\n\nf = E_photon / h\nf = (6.5682 x 10^(-19) J) / (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js)\nf = 9.914 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can use the speed of light equation to find the wavelength of the incident light:\n\nc = λ * f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency.\n\nλ = c / f\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (9.914 x 10^14 Hz)\nλ = 3.024 x 10^(-7) m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers (nm), we can convert meters to nanometers:\n\nλ (nm) = 3.024 x 10^(-7) m * (10^9 nm/m)\nλ (nm) = 302.4 nm\n\nSo, the frequency of the incident light is 9.914 x 10^14 Hz, and the wavelength is 302.4 nm."
