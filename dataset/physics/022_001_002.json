    "message_2": "The theoretical rationale behind the existence of dark matter particles stems from several astrophysical and cosmological observations that cannot be explained by the presence of ordinary matter alone. These observations include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is stronger than can be accounted for by the visible mass in those objects. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang, provide information about the distribution of matter in the early universe. The observed pattern of fluctuations is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps to hold these structures together.\n\nGiven these observations, several candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed. These candidates can be broadly classified into two categories: hot dark matter (HDM) and cold dark matter (CDM).\n\n1. Hot dark matter: These are particles that were moving at relativistic speeds in the early universe. Neutrinos, which are known to have a small but non-zero mass, are a prime example of HDM. However, HDM alone cannot explain the observed large-scale structure of the universe, as it would tend to smooth out the distribution of matter on large scales.\n\n2. Cold dark matter: These are particles that were moving at non-relativistic speeds in the early universe. CDM is considered a more viable candidate for dark matter because it can better explain the observed structure formation in the universe. Some of the proposed CDM candidates include:\n\n   a. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): These are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. They are considered one of the most promising dark matter candidates, and several experiments are currently underway to search for WIMPs, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and direct detection experiments like the XENON and LUX experiments.\n\n   b. Axions: These are hypothetical particles that were proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Axions are predicted to be very light and interact very weakly with ordinary matter, making them a potential dark matter candidate. Experiments like the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) are searching for axions.\n\n   c. Sterile neutrinos: These are hypothetical neutrinos that do not interact through the weak nuclear force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the dark matter density.\n\nIt is important to note that the search for dark matter particles is still ongoing, and no definitive evidence for any of these candidates has been found yet. Future experiments and observations may provide more insights into the nature of dark matter and help to identify the particles responsible for this mysterious component of the universe."
