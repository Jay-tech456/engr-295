    "message_2": "To calculate the duration and frequency of gravitational waves produced during the final stages of the merger of two black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system.\n2. Calculate the chirp mass (M_c), which is a combination of the total mass and reduced mass.\n3. Calculate the frequency (f) and duration (T) of the gravitational waves using the chirp mass.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system.\n\nM = m1 + m2 = 10 M_sun + 15 M_sun = 25 M_sun\nμ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (10 M_sun * 15 M_sun) / (25 M_sun) = 6 M_sun\n\nStep 2: Calculate the chirp mass (M_c).\n\nM_c = (μ^(3/5)) * (M^(2/5)) = (6^(3/5)) * (25^(2/5)) ≈ 12.84 M_sun\n\nStep 3: Calculate the frequency (f) and duration (T) of the gravitational waves using the chirp mass.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf_ISCO = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * M)\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the total mass of the system.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf_ISCO ≈ (3 * 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * (6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2) * (25 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg))\nf_ISCO ≈ 219.9 Hz\n\nThe duration of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nT ≈ 5 * G * M_c / (256 * c^3 * f^(8/3))\nwhere M_c is the chirp mass and f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT ≈ 5 * (6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2) * (12.84 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg) / (256 * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^3 * (219.9 Hz)^(8/3))\nT ≈ 0.019 s\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced during the final stages of the merger of two black holes with masses of 10 and 15 solar masses is approximately 219.9 Hz, and the duration of the gravitational waves is approximately 0.019 seconds."
