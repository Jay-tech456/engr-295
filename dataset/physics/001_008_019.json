    "message_2": "To calculate the energy level splitting between the two spin states of a particle with spin 1/2 in a magnetic field, we can use the formula:\n\nΔE = g * μ_B * B\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy level splitting, g is the g-factor (which is approximately 2 for a free electron), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T), and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the magnetic field strength B = 0.05 T, we can plug in the values and calculate the energy level splitting:\n\nΔE = 2 * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T) * 0.05 T\n\nΔE = 2 * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T) * 0.05 T = 9.274 × 10^-25 J\n\nSo, the energy level splitting between the two spin states of the particle is approximately 9.274 × 10^-25 J."
