    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator (60) and rewrite the equation:\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/di\n\nSubtracting 2/60 from both sides, we get:\n\n1/60 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (di) by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 60 cm\n\nNext, we can determine the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found for di and do:\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object.\n\nFinally, since the image distance (di) is positive, the image is real and inverted. In the case of a concave mirror, a real image is formed on the same side as the object.\n\nIn summary, the image distance is 60 cm, the magnification is -2, and the image is real and inverted."
