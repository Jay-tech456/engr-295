    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of quantum tunneling and the formula for the transmission probability of a particle through a potential barrier. The transmission probability (T) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = exp(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the wave number (K) inside the barrier. The wave number can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / h^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the alpha particle, V is the potential barrier height, E is the energy of the alpha particle, and h is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe mass of an alpha particle (m) is approximately 6.64 × 10^-27 kg, the barrier height (V) is 40 MeV (6.4 × 10^-14 J), the energy of the alpha particle (E) is 5 MeV (8 × 10^-13 J), and the reduced Planck constant (h) is approximately 1.054 × 10^-34 Js.\n\nK = sqrt(2 * 6.64 × 10^-27 * (6.4 × 10^-14 - 8 × 10^-13) / (1.054 × 10^-34)^2)\nK ≈ 1.29 × 10^13 m^-1\n\nNow we can calculate the transmission probability (T) using the formula mentioned earlier:\n\nL = 20 fm = 20 × 10^-15 m\n\nT = exp(-2 * 1.29 × 10^13 * 20 × 10^-15)\nT ≈ 1.16 × 10^-112\n\nThe probability of finding an emitted alpha particle from a nucleus with 5 MeV energy on the other side of an alpha-particle barrier with height 40 MeV and width 20 fm is approximately 1.16 × 10^-112. This probability is extremely low, which indicates that it is highly unlikely for the alpha particle to tunnel through the barrier."
