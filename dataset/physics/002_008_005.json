    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of the copper, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat input (750 J), m is the mass (150 g), c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (80°C - 20°C = 60°C).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 750 J / (150 g × 60°C)\n\nc = 750 J / 9000 g°C\n\nc ≈ 0.0833 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the piece of copper is approximately 0.0833 J/g°C."
