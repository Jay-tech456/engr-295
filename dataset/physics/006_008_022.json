Suppose a photon of frequency v = 6.0 x 10^14 Hz is incident on the metal surface, calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron emitted.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the threshold frequency for aluminum, we can use the equation:\n\nWork function (Φ) = h * ν₀\n\nwhere Φ is the work function, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and ν₀ is the threshold frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the work function from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so:\n\nΦ = 4.26 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 6.8232 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can solve for the threshold frequency:\n\nν₀ = Φ / h = (6.8232 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 1.03 x 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we are given that a photon of frequency v = 6.0 x 10^14 Hz is incident on the metal surface. To calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron emitted, we can use the equation:\n\nKE = h * (ν - ν₀)\n\nwhere KE is the maximum kinetic energy, ν is the frequency of the incident photon, and ν₀ is the threshold frequency.\n\nKE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * ((6.0 x 10^14 Hz) - (1.03 x 10^15 Hz)) = -2.53 x 10^-19 J\n\nSince the kinetic energy is negative, it means that the incident photon does not have enough energy to overcome the work function of the metal and no photoelectron will be emitted."
