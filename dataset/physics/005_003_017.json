    "message_2": "The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the second spaceship with respect to Earth, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth (0.8c), v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = (0.8c + 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * 0.6c) / c^2)\n\nTo simplify the equation, let's divide both the numerator and denominator by c:\n\nv/c = (0.8 + 0.6) / (1 + (0.8 * 0.6))\n\nNow, let's calculate the value:\n\nv/c = (1.4) / (1 + 0.48)\nv/c = 1.4 / 1.48\n\nv/c ≈ 0.9459\n\nNow, multiply both sides by c to get the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth:\n\nv ≈ 0.9459c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth is approximately 0.9459 times the speed of light."
