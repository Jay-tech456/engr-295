    "message_2": "To find the Boyle temperature of the gas, we need to use the combined gas law equation, which is:\n\n(P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nSince the pressure is kept constant, P1 = P2. Therefore, we can simplify the combined gas law equation as follows:\n\n(V1 / T1) = (V2 / T2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for T2:\n\n(2.5 L / 298.15 K) = (1.5 L / T2)\n\nTo solve for T2, we can cross-multiply and divide:\n\nT2 = (1.5 L * 298.15 K) / 2.5 L\n\nT2 ≈ 178.89 K\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature of the gas when its volume is reduced to 1.5 L while keeping its pressure constant is approximately 178.89 K."
