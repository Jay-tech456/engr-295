    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r') / |r'|³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, dl is the small current element, r' is the vector from the current element to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere, we can define the current density J as:\n\nJ = I / (4/3 * π * R³)\n\nNow, let's consider a small volume element dV inside the sphere at a distance r' from the center. The current through this volume element is:\n\ndI = J * dV\n\nTo find the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the sphere, we need to integrate the contribution of magnetic field dB from all the volume elements inside the sphere.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when r < R (i.e., the point P is inside the sphere). In this case, we can use the symmetry of the problem to simplify the calculation. Since the current is uniformly distributed, the magnetic field at the point P will be directed along the radial direction. Therefore, the cross product in the Biot-Savart law becomes:\n\ndl × r' = dl * r' * sin(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r'. Due to symmetry, the magnetic field components in the tangential direction will cancel out, and only the radial components will add up. Thus, we can write:\n\ndB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * r' * sin(θ)) / |r'|³\n\nNow, let's integrate this expression over the entire volume of the sphere. We can use spherical coordinates for the integration:\n\ndV = r'^2 * sin(θ) * dr' * dθ * dφ\n\nIntegrating over the entire volume, we get:\n\nB_radial(r) = ∫∫∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (J * r'^2 * sin(θ) * dr' * dθ * dφ * r' * sin(θ)) / r'^3\n                   = (μ₀ * J / 4π) * ∫(0 to R) ∫(0 to π) ∫(0 to 2π) (r'^2 * sin(θ) * dr' * dθ * dφ)\n\nPerforming the integration, we obtain:\n\nB_radial(r) = (2/3) * μ₀ * J * r\n                   = (2/3) * μ₀ * (I / (4/3 * π * R³)) * r\n                   = (1/2) * (μ₀ * I * r) / (π * R³)\n\nNow, let's consider the case when r > R (i.e., the point P is outside the sphere). In this case, we can treat the sphere as a point current source with the total current I. Using the formula for the magnetic field due to a point current source, we get:\n\nB_radial(r) = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the sphere carrying a steady current I is:\n\nB_radial(r) = (1/2) * (μ₀ * I * r) / (π * R³) for r < R\nB_radial(r) = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) for r ≥ R"
