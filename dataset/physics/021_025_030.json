    "message_2": "The likelihood of supermassive black holes being the source of primordial black holes is currently a topic of debate and research among physicists and astronomers. Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They are different from the more commonly known stellar black holes, which form from the collapse of massive stars.\n\nThere are several theories about the formation of supermassive black holes, which are found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. One theory suggests that they may have formed from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, while another theory proposes that they could have formed from the merger of many smaller black holes, including primordial black holes.\n\nHowever, the idea that supermassive black holes could be the source of primordial black holes is less likely, as it would require a mechanism for the supermassive black holes to create or \"seed\" primordial black holes in the early universe. This would involve a reversal of the more commonly accepted idea that primordial black holes could have played a role in the formation of supermassive black holes.\n\nAs for observational evidence, there is currently no direct evidence supporting the idea that supermassive black holes are the source of primordial black holes. Most of the observational evidence related to primordial black holes comes from their potential effects on cosmic microwave background radiation, gravitational lensing, and gamma-ray bursts. However, these observations are not specific to the relationship between supermassive black holes and primordial black holes.\n\nIn summary, while there is ongoing research and debate about the formation and relationship between supermassive black holes and primordial black holes, it is currently less likely that supermassive black holes are the source of primordial black holes. The observational evidence available does not specifically support this idea, and more research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between these two types of black holes."
