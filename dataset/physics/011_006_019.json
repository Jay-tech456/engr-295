Using the equations for the band structure and conductivity of graphene, calculate the electronic conductivity of the graphene sheet as a function of the electric field strength and the dimensions of the sheet.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the electronic conductivity of the graphene sheet, we need to consider the band structure and the carrier concentration in graphene. Graphene has a unique band structure, with conical bands touching at the Dirac points. The energy-momentum relation near the Dirac points can be described by the following equation:\n\nE(k) = ± ħv_F |k|\n\nwhere E(k) is the energy as a function of the wave vector k, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, v_F is the Fermi velocity in graphene (approximately 10^6 m/s), and the plus and minus signs correspond to the conduction and valence bands, respectively.\n\nThe carrier concentration (n) in graphene can be determined from the Fermi energy (E_F) using the following equation:\n\nn = (k_F^2) / (4π)\n\nwhere k_F is the Fermi wave vector, which can be related to the Fermi energy by:\n\nE_F = ħv_F k_F\n\nNow, we can calculate the conductivity (σ) of graphene using the Kubo formula, which relates the conductivity to the carrier concentration and the scattering time (τ):\n\nσ = e^2 n τ / m*\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge and m* is the effective mass of the charge carriers in graphene. For graphene, the effective mass is given by:\n\nm* = ħ k_F / v_F\n\nSubstituting the expressions for n and m* into the Kubo formula, we get:\n\nσ = e^2 (k_F^2) τ / (4π ħ k_F)\n\nσ = e^2 k_F τ / (4π ħ)\n\nNow, we need to consider the effect of the electric field (E) on the scattering time (τ). The scattering time can be related to the mobility (μ) of the charge carriers:\n\nμ = e τ / m*\n\nThe mobility of charge carriers in graphene depends on the electric field strength. In general, the mobility decreases as the electric field strength increases due to increased scattering events. The relationship between the mobility and the electric field strength can be described by a power law:\n\nμ(E) = μ_0 (1 + (E/E_0)^α)^(-1)\n\nwhere μ_0 is the mobility at zero electric field, E_0 is a characteristic electric field strength, and α is a constant that depends on the scattering mechanism.\n\nTo find the conductivity as a function of the electric field strength, we can substitute the expression for the mobility into the Kubo formula:\n\nσ(E) = e^2 k_F τ(E) / (4π ħ)\n\nσ(E) = e^2 k_F (μ(E) m*) / (4π ħ e)\n\nσ(E) = k_F μ(E) ħ v_F / (4π ħ)\n\nσ(E) = k_F μ_0 (1 + (E/E_0)^α)^(-1) v_F / (4π)\n\nFinally, we can express the Fermi wave vector (k_F) in terms of the dimensions of the graphene sheet (L and W) and the carrier concentration (n):\n\nk_F = √(4πn) = √(4π N / (LW))\n\nwhere N is the total number of charge carriers in the graphene sheet.\n\nThe electronic conductivity of the graphene sheet as a function of the electric field strength (E) and the dimensions of the sheet (L and W) is given by:\n\nσ(E, L, W) = (√(4π N / (LW))) μ_0 (1 + (E/E_0)^α)^(-1) v_F / (4π)"
