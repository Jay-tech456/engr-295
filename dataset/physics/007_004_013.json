    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total energy produced by the 200 kg of enriched uranium fuel and then calculate the electrical output based on the thermal efficiency of the reactor.\n\n1. Calculate the total energy produced by the fuel:\nEnergy density of the fuel = 76.4 GJ/kg\nTotal energy produced = (Energy density) × (Mass of fuel)\nTotal energy produced = 76.4 GJ/kg × 200 kg = 15280 GJ\n\n2. Convert the average burn-up from GWd/t to GJ/kg:\n1 GWd/t = (1 × 10^9 W) × (24 × 3600 s) / (10^6 kg)\n1 GWd/t = 86.4 GJ/kg\n\n3. Calculate the mass of fuel consumed:\nBurn-up = 50 GWd/t = 50 × 86.4 GJ/kg = 4320 GJ/kg\nMass of fuel consumed = (Total energy produced) / (Burn-up)\nMass of fuel consumed = 15280 GJ / 4320 GJ/kg = 3.54 kg\n\n4. Calculate the thermal power output of the reactor:\nThermal power output = (Total energy produced) / (Mass of fuel consumed)\nThermal power output = 15280 GJ / 3.54 kg = 4320 GW\n\n5. Calculate the electrical output based on the thermal efficiency:\nElectrical output = (Thermal power output) × (Thermal efficiency)\nElectrical output = 4320 GW × 0.33 = 1425.6 GW\n\nThe maximum electrical output of the nuclear reactor is 1425.6 GW."
