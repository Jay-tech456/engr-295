    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the magnetic phase transition of iron-based superconductors can be understood by examining the interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and the crystal lattice structure. Iron-based superconductors are a class of high-temperature superconductors that exhibit superconductivity when cooled below a certain critical temperature (Tc). These materials typically have a layered structure with iron and other elements, such as arsenic or selenium, forming planes that are responsible for their unique properties.\n\nAt high temperatures, iron-based superconductors exhibit a paramagnetic state, where the magnetic moments of the iron atoms are randomly oriented. As the temperature is lowered, a magnetic phase transition occurs, and the material enters an antiferromagnetic state. In this state, the magnetic moments of the iron atoms align in a specific pattern, resulting in a net magnetization of zero.\n\nThe magnetic phase transition is closely related to the superconducting properties of iron-based superconductors. The onset of superconductivity is often accompanied by a suppression of the antiferromagnetic order. This is because the formation of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for superconductivity, is generally incompatible with the presence of long-range magnetic order.\n\nAs the temperature is further lowered below the critical temperature (Tc), the material enters the superconducting state, where electrical resistance drops to zero, and the material exhibits perfect diamagnetism. In this state, the magnetic moments of the iron atoms are effectively \"locked\" into the superconducting state, and the material no longer exhibits any magnetic order.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the magnetic phase transition of iron-based superconductors can be described as follows:\n\n1. At high temperatures, the material is in a paramagnetic state with randomly oriented magnetic moments.\n2. As the temperature is lowered, a magnetic phase transition occurs, and the material enters an antiferromagnetic state with a specific pattern of magnetic moments.\n3. The onset of superconductivity suppresses the antiferromagnetic order, and the material enters the superconducting state below the critical temperature (Tc).\n4. In the superconducting state, the magnetic moments are effectively \"locked\" and the material exhibits perfect diamagnetism.\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between temperature, magnetism, and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors is crucial for the development of new materials with improved properties and potential applications in various fields, such as energy transmission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantum computing."
