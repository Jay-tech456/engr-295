    "message_2": "To find the minimum distance between the object and the convex lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the image distance (v) is 40 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/40 - 1/u\n\nNow, we need to solve for u (the object distance):\n\n1/u = 1/20 - 1/40\n1/u = (2 - 1)/40\n1/u = 1/40\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nu = 40 cm\n\nSo, the minimum distance between the object and the convex lens is 40 cm."
