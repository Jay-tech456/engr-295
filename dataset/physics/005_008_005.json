Calculate the distance between Earth and the spacecraft according to an Earth observer after 4 years have passed for Earth. Use the Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lorentz transformation equations for space and time. The Lorentz transformation equations are given by:\n\nx' = γ(x - vt)\nt' = γ(t - vx/c^2)\n\nwhere x and t are the coordinates in the Earth's frame, x' and t' are the coordinates in the spacecraft's frame, v is the relative velocity between the frames, c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor γ for the given relative velocity of 0.8c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ = 5/3\n\nNow, we need to find the time t' in the spacecraft's frame when 4 years have passed for Earth. We can use the second Lorentz transformation equation for this:\n\nt' = γ(t - vx/c^2)\nt' = (5/3)(4 - (0.8c)(4)/c^2)\nt' = (5/3)(4 - 3.2)\nt' = (5/3)(0.8)\nt' = 4/3 years\n\nNow, we can use the first Lorentz transformation equation to find the distance x' in the spacecraft's frame when t' = 4/3 years:\n\nx' = γ(x - vt)\nx' = (5/3)(3c - 0.8c(4/3))\nx' = (5/3)(3c - 3.2c)\nx' = (5/3)(-0.2c)\nx' = -1/3 c\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the spacecraft is moving away from Earth. So, the distance between Earth and the spacecraft according to an Earth observer after 4 years have passed for Earth is:\n\nDistance = 3 light-years - 1/3 light-year\nDistance = 8/3 light-years ≈ 2.67 light-years"
