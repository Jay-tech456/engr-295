    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are one of the proposed candidates for dark matter in the universe. They are made up of baryonic matter and include objects such as brown dwarfs, black holes, and other massive compact objects. The upper limit of mass for MACHOs is constrained by various observational data and experiments, such as microlensing surveys and dynamical constraints.\n\nBased on current observational data, the upper limit of mass for MACHOs to still be considered a viable candidate for making up a significant portion of dark matter is around 30 solar masses. This is because objects with masses above this limit would have been detected through various surveys and experiments, such as the EROS (Experience de Recherche d'Objets Sombres) and MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Objects) projects, which have not found a significant number of MACHOs in this mass range.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the exact upper limit may vary depending on the specific assumptions and models used in the analysis. Additionally, recent discoveries of massive black holes through gravitational wave observations have opened up the possibility that primordial black holes with masses in the range of 1 to 100 solar masses could still contribute to the dark matter content of the universe. However, this is still an area of active research and debate among scientists."
