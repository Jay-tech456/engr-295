    "message_1": "A parallel-plate capacitor with a thickness of 2 cm and a plate separation distance of 3 cm has a current of 4 A flowing through it. What is the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm above the center of the capacitor?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm above the center of the capacitor, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the capacitor is a parallel-plate capacitor, the magnetic field produced by the current flowing through the plates will cancel each other out. Therefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm above the center of the capacitor will be 0 T (Tesla)."
