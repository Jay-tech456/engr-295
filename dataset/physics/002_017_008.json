    "message_1": "A physics student is given a sample of carbon dioxide stored at 25 °C with a volume of 3.0 L. Calculate the critical pressure of carbon dioxide.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical pressure of carbon dioxide, we need to know its critical constants. The critical constants for carbon dioxide are:\n\nCritical temperature (Tc) = 304.1 K\nCritical pressure (Pc) = 7.38 MPa\n\nHowever, the given information is about a sample of carbon dioxide at 25 °C and 3.0 L volume. This information is not directly related to the critical pressure. The critical pressure is a property of the substance and does not depend on the specific sample's conditions.\n\nSo, the critical pressure of carbon dioxide is:\n\nPc = 7.38 MPa"
