    "message_2": "The magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a spin glass system is a measure of how much the material becomes magnetized in response to an applied magnetic field. In a spin glass system, the magnetic moments of the individual atoms or ions are randomly oriented, leading to a complex and disordered magnetic state.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of a spin glass system as a function of temperature (T) can be described by the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nχ(T) = C / (T - θ)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, and θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. For a spin glass system, the Curie-Weiss temperature is typically negative, indicating the presence of frustration and competition between different magnetic interactions.\n\nAs the temperature decreases, the magnetic susceptibility of a spin glass system increases, reaching a maximum value at the freezing temperature (Tf). Below Tf, the system enters a spin glass phase, where the magnetic moments become frozen in a disordered and non-equilibrium state. In this phase, the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a power-law dependence on temperature:\n\nχ(T) ∝ (T - Tf)^(-γ)\n\nwhere γ is a critical exponent.\n\nIn comparison, the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic system also follows the Curie-Weiss law, but with a positive Curie-Weiss temperature. This indicates that the magnetic interactions in a ferromagnetic system are cooperative and favor parallel alignment of the magnetic moments. As the temperature decreases, the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic system increases, reaching a maximum value at the Curie temperature (Tc). Below Tc, the system enters a ferromagnetic phase, where the magnetic moments align parallel to each other, leading to a spontaneous magnetization.\n\nIn summary, both spin glass and ferromagnetic systems exhibit an increase in magnetic susceptibility as the temperature decreases. However, the spin glass system has a negative Curie-Weiss temperature and enters a disordered, non-equilibrium state at low temperatures, while the ferromagnetic system has a positive Curie-Weiss temperature and enters a cooperative, ordered state at low temperatures."
