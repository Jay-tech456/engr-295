    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier, we can use the formula for the transmission coefficient (T) in quantum mechanics, which is given by:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the decay constant and L is the width of the barrier. The decay constant (K) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nK = (1 / ħ) * sqrt(2 * m * (V - E))\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 x 10^(-34) Js), m is the mass of the electron (9.1 x 10^(-31) kg), V is the potential energy of the barrier (2 eV), and E is the energy of the electron (3 eV).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the potential energy (V) and the energy of the electron (E) from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We can do this using the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.602176634 x 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, V = 2 eV * (1.602176634 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 3.204353268 x 10^(-19) J\nand E = 3 eV * (1.602176634 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 4.806529902 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNow we can calculate the decay constant (K):\n\nK = (1 / (1.0545718 x 10^(-34) Js)) * sqrt(2 * (9.1 x 10^(-31) kg) * ((3.204353268 x 10^(-19) J) - (4.806529902 x 10^(-19) J)))\nK ≈ 1.213 x 10^10 m^(-1)\n\nThe width of the barrier (L) is equal to the Bohr radius:\n\nL = 5 x 10^(-11) m\n\nNow we can calculate the transmission coefficient (T):\n\nT = e^(-2 * (1.213 x 10^10 m^(-1)) * (5 x 10^(-11) m))\nT ≈ 0.000450\n\nSo, the probability of an electron tunneling through the potential barrier is approximately 0.045% or 4.5 x 10^(-4)."
