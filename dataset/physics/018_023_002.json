    "message_2": "To improve the precision of the strong coupling constant (αs) determination through QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) sum rules, we can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Higher-order perturbative calculations: Including higher-order terms in the perturbative series can lead to better precision in the determination of αs. This requires calculating higher-order corrections to the QCD sum rules, which can be computationally intensive but will lead to more accurate results.\n\n2. Improved non-perturbative contributions: Non-perturbative effects play a crucial role in QCD sum rules. Improving our understanding of these effects, such as condensates and instantons, and incorporating them more accurately in the sum rules can lead to better precision in αs determination.\n\n3. Lattice QCD simulations: Lattice QCD provides a non-perturbative approach to study QCD and can be used to calculate various quantities, including αs, with high precision. By improving lattice QCD simulations, such as using finer lattice spacings, larger volumes, and better algorithms, we can obtain more accurate results for αs, which can then be used to improve the QCD sum rules.\n\n4. Experimental data: QCD sum rules rely on experimental data for various quantities, such as spectral functions and decay constants. By improving the precision of these experimental measurements, we can reduce the uncertainties in the QCD sum rules and obtain a more precise value for αs.\n\n5. Cross-checks and consistency: Comparing the results obtained from different methods, such as QCD sum rules, lattice QCD, and experimental measurements, can help identify inconsistencies and improve the overall precision of αs determination. This requires a collaborative effort between theorists and experimentalists to ensure that the methods are consistent and compatible.\n\n6. Global analyses: Performing global analyses that combine various sources of information, such as QCD sum rules, lattice QCD, and experimental data, can help constrain the value of αs more precisely. This requires developing sophisticated statistical methods and tools to combine the different sources of information in a consistent manner.\n\nIn summary, improving the precision of the strong coupling constant determination through QCD sum rules requires a combination of theoretical advancements, better experimental data, and sophisticated statistical analyses. By working together, physicists can continue to refine our understanding of the strong force and the fundamental parameters that govern it."
