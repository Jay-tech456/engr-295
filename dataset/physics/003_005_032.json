    "message_1": "A straight wire carrying a current of 5 A is located at a distance of 15 cm from a point P. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at point P due to the wire.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at point P due to the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire to point P.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 5 A (current)\nr = 15 cm = 0.15 m (distance)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.3 m)\n\nB = (20/0.3) × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB ≈ 6.67 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 6.67 × 10⁻⁷ T.\n\nNow, let's determine the direction of the magnetic field. We can use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field around the wire. Point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), and your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have information about the orientation of the wire and point P, we can't provide a specific direction. However, you can use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field based on the given orientation of the wire and point P in your specific problem."
