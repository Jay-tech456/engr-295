    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the physics student to solve:\n\nCalculate the fugacity of water vapor at a temperature of 100°C and a pressure of 1 atm, given that the vapor pressure of pure water at this temperature is 1.01325 atm.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of water vapor, we can use the following formula:\n\nfugacity = φ * P\n\nwhere φ is the fugacity coefficient and P is the pressure of the system.\n\nFirst, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ). We can use the following equation to find the fugacity coefficient:\n\nφ = (P_actual / P_ideal)\n\nwhere P_actual is the actual pressure of the system (1 atm) and P_ideal is the vapor pressure of pure water at the given temperature (1.01325 atm).\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity coefficient:\n\nφ = (1 atm) / (1.01325 atm) = 0.9869\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity of water vapor:\n\nfugacity = φ * P = 0.9869 * 1 atm = 0.9869 atm\n\nSo, the fugacity of water vapor at a temperature of 100°C and a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 0.9869 atm."
