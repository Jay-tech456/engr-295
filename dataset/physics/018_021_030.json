    "message_2": "The decay of a muon into an electron and a photon in a vacuum is a highly suppressed process due to the conservation of lepton flavor. In the Standard Model of particle physics, this decay is forbidden at tree level and can only occur through higher-order loop processes, making it extremely rare.\n\nThe probability of this decay happening in a vacuum is very low, with a branching ratio on the order of 10^(-13) or less. This means that out of about 10^13 muon decays, only one would result in an electron and a photon.\n\nIn a non-vacuum environment with a heavy nucleus present, the probability of this decay can be slightly enhanced due to the interaction of the muon with the heavy nucleus. This interaction can lead to processes such as nuclear muon capture, where the muon is captured by the nucleus and subsequently decays. However, even in this case, the probability of a muon decaying into an electron and a photon remains extremely low, and the enhancement factor is not significant enough to make this decay a common occurrence.\n\nIn summary, the probability of a muon decaying into an electron and a photon is extremely low in both vacuum and non-vacuum environments, with only a slight enhancement in the presence of a heavy nucleus."
