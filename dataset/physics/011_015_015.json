    "message_2": "When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the surface of a magnetic thin film, it can significantly affect the magnetic properties of the film, particularly its magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic anisotropy refers to the dependence of the magnetic properties on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In a magnetic thin film, the magnetic anisotropy is typically dominated by shape anisotropy and magnetocrystalline anisotropy.\n\nThe effect of the perpendicular magnetic field on the magnetic anisotropy can be understood in terms of the competition between the different energy contributions in the system. These energy contributions include the Zeeman energy (associated with the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moments), the exchange energy (related to the interaction between neighboring magnetic moments), the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (arising from the dependence of the magnetic properties on the crystallographic directions), and the shape anisotropy energy (due to the demagnetizing field created by the shape of the film).\n\nWhen a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the surface of the thin film, the Zeeman energy tends to align the magnetic moments along the direction of the field. This can lead to a reorientation of the magnetic moments and a change in the magnetic anisotropy. Depending on the strength of the applied field and the relative magnitudes of the other energy contributions, the following effects can be observed:\n\n1. Increase in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy: If the applied field is strong enough, it can overcome the shape anisotropy and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, leading to a preferential alignment of the magnetic moments along the direction of the field. This results in an increase in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.\n\n2. Magnetic reorientation transition: In some cases, the applied field can induce a transition between different magnetic states, such as from an in-plane magnetization state to a perpendicular magnetization state. This transition is associated with a change in the magnetic anisotropy.\n\n3. Modification of domain structures: The applied field can also affect the magnetic domain structures in the thin film, leading to changes in the domain size, shape, and arrangement. These changes can, in turn, influence the magnetic anisotropy.\n\n4. Induction of magnetic bistability or multistability: In some magnetic thin films, the competition between the different energy contributions can lead to the coexistence of multiple stable magnetic states with different anisotropy properties. The applied field can be used to control the switching between these states.\n\nIn summary, the application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of a magnetic thin film can significantly affect its magnetic anisotropy, leading to various effects such as an increase in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, magnetic reorientation transitions, modification of domain structures, and induction of magnetic bistability or multistability. The specific effects depend on the strength of the applied field and the relative magnitudes of the different energy contributions in the system."
