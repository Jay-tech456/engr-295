    "message_2": "As of my knowledge up to September 2021, the most precise measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson is approximately 125.1 GeV/c² (gigaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared), with an uncertainty of about 0.14 GeV/c². This value was obtained through the combined analysis of data from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nThe measurement of the Higgs boson mass was achieved using the LHC by observing the decay products of the Higgs boson in various decay channels. The LHC accelerates protons to nearly the speed of light and collides them at high energies, producing a variety of particles, including the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays rapidly into other particles, which can be detected by the ATLAS and CMS detectors.\n\nThe most prominent decay channels for the Higgs boson include decays into pairs of photons, Z bosons, W bosons, and bottom quarks. By analyzing the energy and momentum of these decay products, physicists can reconstruct the mass of the Higgs boson. The mass measurement is obtained by combining the results from multiple decay channels and both the ATLAS and CMS experiments, which helps to reduce the overall uncertainty in the measurement.\n\nIt is important to note that the mass of the Higgs boson is a crucial parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics, as it helps to determine the properties of the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving other particles mass. The precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass also allows physicists to test the consistency of the Standard Model and probe for potential new physics beyond the current theoretical framework."
