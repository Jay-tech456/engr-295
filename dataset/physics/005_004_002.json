    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy and momentum of a particle, we need to use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E): E = γmc^2\n2. Relativistic momentum (p): p = γmv\n\nwhere:\n- m is the mass of the particle (0.5 kg)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\n- v is the velocity of the particle (0.4c)\n- γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, given by the equation: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.4c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.16)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.84)\nγ ≈ 1.091\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE ≈ 1.091 * 0.5 kg * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 1.091 * 0.5 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 J/kg\nE ≈ 4.914 x 10^16 J\n\nAnd finally, the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np ≈ 1.091 * 0.5 kg * 0.4 * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 1.091 * 0.5 kg * 1.2 x 10^8 m/s\np ≈ 6.546 x 10^7 kg*m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the particle is approximately 4.914 x 10^16 Joules, and its relativistic momentum is approximately 6.546 x 10^7 kg*m/s."
