    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, the distance of closest approach (also known as the impact parameter) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K.E.)\n\nwhere d is the distance of closest approach, k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the two particles, and K.E. is the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nGiven the charges of the gold nucleus (+79e) and the alpha particle (+2e), we can substitute the values into the formula. The charge of an electron (e) is 1.6 x 10^-19 C, so the charges of the gold nucleus and the alpha particle are:\n\nq1 = +79e = +79 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C\nq2 = +2e = +2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle is given as 5.5 MeV, which we need to convert to Joules:\n\nK.E. = 5.5 MeV * (1.6 x 10^-13 J/MeV) = 8.8 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2 * 79 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C * 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C) / (2 * 8.8 x 10^-13 J)\n\nd â‰ˆ 2.27 x 10^-14 m\n\nSo, the distance of closest approach between the gold nucleus and the alpha particle in this Rutherford scattering experiment is approximately 2.27 x 10^-14 meters."
