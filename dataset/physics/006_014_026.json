    "message_1": "Calculate the lifetime of an excited state in an atom if the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is 3 eV and the decay rate is 4.5 x 10^8 s^-1.",
    "message_2": "The lifetime (τ) of an excited state in an atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nτ = 1 / decay rate\n\nGiven the decay rate (Γ) is 4.5 x 10^8 s^-1, we can calculate the lifetime as follows:\n\nτ = 1 / (4.5 x 10^8 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 2.22 x 10^-9 s\n\nTherefore, the lifetime of the excited state is approximately 2.22 x 10^-9 seconds."
