    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of a coaxial cable carrying a current of 5 A? The inner radius of the cable is 1 cm, the outer radius is 2 cm, and the cable is made of a material with magnetic permeability of 4π x 10^-7 H/m.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of a coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Since the distance is greater than the outer radius of the cable, we can treat the cable as a long straight wire carrying a total current of 5 A.\n\nAmpere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the material, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the wire.\n\nGiven the values:\nμ₀ = 4π x 10^-7 H/m\nI = 5 A\nr = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 H/m * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nB = (20π x 10^-7 T) / (0.08π)\n\nB = (20 x 10^-7 T) / 0.08\n\nB = 2.5 x 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is 2.5 x 10^-6 Tesla."
