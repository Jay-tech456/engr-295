    "message_2": "To find the pressure drop per meter of length of the pipe due to friction, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\nΔP/L = f * (ρ * v²) / (2 * D)\n\nwhere ΔP is the pressure drop, L is the length of the pipe, f is the Darcy friction factor, ρ is the density of the liquid, v is the flow velocity, and D is the diameter of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to find the flow velocity (v). The flow rate (Q) is given as 0.5 m³/s. The flow velocity can be found using the formula:\n\nQ = A * v\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. For a circular pipe, the area can be calculated as:\n\nA = π * (D/2)²\n\nA = π * (0.1/2)²\nA ≈ 0.00785 m²\n\nNow, we can find the flow velocity:\n\nv = Q / A\nv = 0.5 / 0.00785\nv ≈ 63.69 m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime and calculate the Darcy friction factor (f). The Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRe = (ρ * v * D) / μ\n\nwhere μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid.\n\nRe = (800 * 63.69 * 0.1) / 0.02\nRe ≈ 2,547,600\n\nSince the Reynolds number is greater than 4000, the flow is considered turbulent. We can use the Colebrook equation to estimate the Darcy friction factor (f):\n\n1 / √f = -2 * log10((ε / (3.7 * D)) + (2.51 / (Re * √f)))\n\nwhere ε is the pipe roughness. Assuming a smooth pipe (ε = 0), we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1 / √f = -2 * log10(2.51 / (Re * √f))\n\nSolving this equation iteratively, we get:\n\nf ≈ 0.008\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure drop per meter of length of the pipe using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\nΔP/L = f * (ρ * v²) / (2 * D)\nΔP/L = 0.008 * (800 * 63.69²) / (2 * 0.1)\nΔP/L ≈ 129,032 Pa/m\n\nThe pressure drop per meter of length of the pipe due to friction is approximately 129,032 Pa/m."
