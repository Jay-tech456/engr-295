    "message_1": "What is the internal energy of a gas that undergoes a process where it expands from a volume of 2 L to 6 L, and has a work done on it of 500 J, assuming the gas does not transfer heat to or from its surroundings? The gas has a constant pressure of 5 atm and there are no changes in its chemical composition.",
    "message_2": "To find the change in internal energy of the gas, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (∆U) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\n∆U = Q - W\n\nSince the gas does not transfer heat to or from its surroundings, Q = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n∆U = -W\n\nWe are given that the work done on the gas is 500 J. However, since the work is done on the gas, the work done by the system is negative:\n\nW = -500 J\n\nNow we can find the change in internal energy:\n\n∆U = -(-500 J)\n∆U = 500 J\n\nThe internal energy of the gas increases by 500 J during the process."
