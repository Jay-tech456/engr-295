    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures 800 K and 300 K. What is the Carnot efficiency of this heat engine?",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency of a heat engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. The temperatures must be in the same unit, such as Kelvin (K).\n\nIn this case, T_hot = 800 K and T_cold = 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 800 K) = 1 - 0.375 = 0.625\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of this heat engine is 0.625 or 62.5%."
