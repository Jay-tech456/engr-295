    "message_1": "Sure, here is a possible problem for a physics student:\n\nYou have been tasked with building a topological qubit using a Majorana fermion. Given that the fermion is located on a nanowire with length 1 µm and diameter 50 nm, and that the proximity effect creates a superconducting gap of 0.1 eV, calculate:\n\n1. The critical magnetic field above which the fermion will no longer behave as a Majorana particle, given that the effective g-factor is 10.\n2. The minimum temperature required to keep the qubit coherent for at least 1 µs, assuming a relaxation time of 10 µs and a dephasing time of 100 ns.",
    "message_2": "1. To calculate the critical magnetic field, we can use the following formula:\n\nB_c = Δ / (μ_B * g)\n\nwhere B_c is the critical magnetic field, Δ is the superconducting gap, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and g is the effective g-factor.\n\nGiven the superconducting gap Δ = 0.1 eV and the effective g-factor g = 10, we can calculate the critical magnetic field. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 5.79 × 10^(-5) eV/T.\n\nB_c = (0.1 eV) / (5.79 × 10^(-5) eV/T * 10)\nB_c ≈ 172.7 T\n\nSo, the critical magnetic field above which the fermion will no longer behave as a Majorana particle is approximately 172.7 T.\n\n2. To calculate the minimum temperature required to keep the qubit coherent for at least 1 µs, we can use the following formula:\n\nT_min = ħ / (k_B * τ)\n\nwhere T_min is the minimum temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and τ is the relaxation time.\n\nGiven the relaxation time τ = 10 µs and the dephasing time of 100 ns, we can calculate the minimum temperature. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.05 × 10^(-34) J·s, and the Boltzmann constant k_B is approximately 1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nSince the relaxation time is longer than the dephasing time, we will use the relaxation time to calculate the minimum temperature.\n\nT_min = (1.05 × 10^(-34) J·s) / (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K * 10 × 10^(-6) s)\nT_min ≈ 7.6 × 10^(-3) K\n\nSo, the minimum temperature required to keep the qubit coherent for at least 1 µs is approximately 7.6 mK."
