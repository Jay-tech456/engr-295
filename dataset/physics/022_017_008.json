    "message_2": "A WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) is a hypothetical particle that is a candidate for dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. WIMPs are thought to be massive particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter, primarily through the weak nuclear force and gravity.\n\nThe estimated mass range of a WIMP is typically between 1 GeV/c² and 1 TeV/c² (gigaelectronvolt per speed of light squared and teraelectronvolt per speed of light squared, respectively). This mass range is significantly larger than the mass of known subatomic particles like protons (approximately 0.938 GeV/c²) and electrons (approximately 0.000511 GeV/c²). However, it is comparable to the mass of some other hypothetical particles, such as supersymmetric partners of known particles.\n\nThe non-detection of WIMPs in current experiments can indeed be explained by their extremely weak interaction with matter. Since WIMPs interact primarily through the weak nuclear force, they are expected to have a very low probability of interacting with ordinary matter. This makes them difficult to detect directly, as they would rarely produce a signal in a detector.\n\nCurrent experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and dedicated dark matter detectors like the XENON and LUX experiments, have been searching for WIMPs but have not yet found any conclusive evidence for their existence. The non-detection of WIMPs could be due to their weak interaction with matter, or it could be that their mass is outside the range currently being probed by experiments. Alternatively, it is possible that dark matter is composed of particles other than WIMPs, or that our understanding of dark matter needs to be revised.\n\nIn summary, the estimated mass range of a WIMP is between 1 GeV/c² and 1 TeV/c², which is larger than the mass of known subatomic particles. The non-detection of WIMPs in current experiments can be explained by their extremely weak interaction with matter, which makes them difficult to detect directly."
