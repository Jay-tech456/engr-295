    "message_2": "The relationship between wavelength, frequency, and color perception in the human eye can be described by the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the visible light spectrum. Visible light is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can detect, and it consists of wavelengths ranging from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm.\n\nWavelength and frequency are inversely related, as described by the equation:\n\nc = λν\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second), λ (lambda) is the wavelength, and ν (nu) is the frequency. As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.\n\nColor perception in the human eye is determined by the wavelength of light. Our eyes contain specialized cells called cones, which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. There are three types of cones: S-cones (short-wavelength), M-cones (medium-wavelength), and L-cones (long-wavelength). These cones are sensitive to different parts of the visible light spectrum, allowing us to perceive colors.\n\nThe relationship between wavelength and color perception can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Shorter wavelengths (around 380-450 nm) correspond to higher frequencies and are perceived as violet or blue colors.\n2. Medium wavelengths (around 450-550 nm) correspond to intermediate frequencies and are perceived as green and yellow colors.\n3. Longer wavelengths (around 550-750 nm) correspond to lower frequencies and are perceived as orange and red colors.\n\nIt is important to note that color perception is a complex process that involves not only the physical properties of light but also the processing of visual information by the brain. Factors such as brightness, contrast, and surrounding colors can also influence how we perceive colors."
