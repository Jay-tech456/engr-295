    "message_2": "The work function of an atom is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom. In the photoelectric effect, when a photon with energy greater than the work function strikes the atom, an electron is emitted with a certain kinetic energy. The relationship between the energy of the incoming photon (E_photon), the work function (Φ), and the kinetic energy of the emitted electron (KE) is given by the equation:\n\nE_photon = Φ + KE\n\nIn this problem, we are given the photoelectric threshold energy (E_photon) as 4.5 eV and the kinetic energy of the emitted electron (KE) as 3.2 eV. We can use the equation above to solve for the work function (Φ):\n\n4.5 eV = Φ + 3.2 eV\n\nTo find the work function, subtract the kinetic energy from the photoelectric threshold energy:\n\nΦ = 4.5 eV - 3.2 eV\nΦ = 1.3 eV\n\nThe work function of the atom is 1.3 eV."
