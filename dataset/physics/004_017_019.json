    "message_2": "In General Relativity, the deflection angle of light by a point mass can be calculated using the formula derived by Albert Einstein:\n\nα = 4GM / (c^2 * b),\n\nwhere α is the deflection angle, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the point mass, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the closest distance the light would pass by the point mass in the absence of gravity).\n\nIn Newtonian gravity, the deflection angle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα_Newton = 2GM / (c^2 * b),\n\nwhich is half the value of the deflection angle predicted by General Relativity.\n\nGravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a star or a galaxy. This effect can be used to illustrate the difference between the predictions of General Relativity and Newtonian gravity.\n\nIn the case of a point mass, the deflection angle predicted by General Relativity is twice the value predicted by Newtonian gravity. This means that the light will be bent more in the presence of a massive object according to General Relativity than it would be according to Newtonian gravity. This difference in deflection angles can lead to observable effects, such as the formation of multiple images of a background source (e.g., a distant galaxy) due to the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground massive object (e.g., a galaxy cluster).\n\nOne of the first experimental confirmations of General Relativity came from the observation of the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the 1919 solar eclipse. The measured deflection angle was found to be in agreement with the prediction of General Relativity, providing strong evidence for the validity of Einstein's theory over Newtonian gravity."
