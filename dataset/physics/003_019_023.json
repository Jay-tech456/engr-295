    "message_1": "A coaxial cable with a radius of 0.5 cm has an inner conductor carrying a current of 2 A in the positive x direction, while the outer conductor carries a current of -1 A in the positive z direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the cable?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, let's consider the magnetic field due to the inner conductor carrying a current of 2 A in the positive x direction. Since the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the conductor, we can choose a circular loop of radius r (2 cm in this case) centered on the conductor as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field will be tangent to this loop at every point.\n\nFor the inner conductor, the enclosed current is 2 A. Therefore, we have:\n\n∮B_inner⋅dl = μ₀(2 A)\n\nSince B_inner is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB_inner ∮dl = μ₀(2 A)\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the loop is equal to the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr:\n\nB_inner(2πr) = μ₀(2 A)\n\nNow, we can solve for B_inner:\n\nB_inner = (μ₀(2 A)) / (2πr)\n\nNext, let's consider the magnetic field due to the outer conductor carrying a current of -1 A in the positive z direction. Since the current is in the opposite direction, the magnetic field will be in the opposite direction as well. We can use the same circular loop of radius r centered on the conductor as our path for the line integral.\n\nFor the outer conductor, the enclosed current is -1 A. Therefore, we have:\n\n∮B_outer⋅dl = μ₀(-1 A)\n\nSince B_outer is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB_outer ∮dl = μ₀(-1 A)\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the loop is equal to the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr:\n\nB_outer(2πr) = μ₀(-1 A)\n\nNow, we can solve for B_outer:\n\nB_outer = (μ₀(-1 A)) / (2πr)\n\nSince the magnetic fields due to the inner and outer conductors are in opposite directions, we can find the net magnetic field by adding the magnitudes of the two fields:\n\nB_net = B_inner + B_outer\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for r and μ₀:\n\nr = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB_inner = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 2 A) / (2π × 0.02 m) = 20 × 10^(-7) T = 2 × 10^(-5) T\nB_outer = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × (-1 A)) / (2π × 0.02 m) = -10 × 10^(-7) T = -1 × 10^(-5) T\n\nB_net = 2 × 10^(-5) T + (-1 × 10^(-5) T) = 1 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the net magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the cable is 1 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the inner conductor is stronger than the magnetic field due to the outer conductor, the net magnetic field will be in the same direction as the magnetic field due to the inner conductor, which is tangent to the circular loop centered on the conductor."
