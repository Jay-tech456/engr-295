    "message_1": "A convex lens made of crown glass has a focal length of 20 cm. The refractive index of the crown glass for red light is 1.51, and for violet light, it is 1.54. Calculate the focal length of the convex lens for violet light. How much farther will the violet light rays focus from the lens compared to the red light rays?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the focal length of the convex lens for violet light, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since the lens is made of the same material, the ratio of the focal lengths for red and violet light will be the same as the ratio of their refractive indices:\n\nf_violet / f_red = n_violet / n_red\n\nWe are given the focal length for red light (f_red = 20 cm) and the refractive indices for red (n_red = 1.51) and violet (n_violet = 1.54) light. We can now find the focal length for violet light (f_violet):\n\nf_violet = f_red * (n_violet / n_red)\nf_violet = 20 cm * (1.54 / 1.51)\nf_violet ≈ 20.26 cm\n\nThe focal length of the convex lens for violet light is approximately 20.26 cm.\n\nTo find how much farther the violet light rays focus from the lens compared to the red light rays, we can subtract the focal length of red light from the focal length of violet light:\n\nDifference = f_violet - f_red\nDifference = 20.26 cm - 20 cm\nDifference ≈ 0.26 cm\n\nThe violet light rays will focus approximately 0.26 cm farther from the lens compared to the red light rays."
