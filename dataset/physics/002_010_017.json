    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat energy required to completely vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = m × L\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy required, m is the mass of water, and L is the specific latent heat of vaporization.\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 grams = 0.05 kg (converting grams to kilograms)\nL = 2.26 × 10^6 J/kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nQ = 0.05 kg × 2.26 × 10^6 J/kg\n\nQ = 1.13 × 10^5 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat energy required to completely vaporize 50 grams of water at its boiling point and atmospheric pressure is 1.13 × 10^5 Joules."
