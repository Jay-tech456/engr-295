    "message_2": "The relationship between the magnetic susceptibility (χ) and temperature (T) of a ferromagnetic material is described by the Curie-Weiss law. The Curie-Weiss law states that the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic material is inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature and the Curie temperature (Tc) of the material. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ is the magnetic susceptibility, T is the temperature, Tc is the Curie temperature, and C is the Curie constant, which depends on the material.\n\nThe Curie temperature is a critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic. Below the Curie temperature, the material exhibits ferromagnetic behavior, with a strong, spontaneous magnetization due to the alignment of magnetic moments in the material.\n\nAs the temperature of a ferromagnetic material increases, its magnetic susceptibility decreases. This is because the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments to become more randomly oriented, reducing the overall magnetization of the material. When the temperature reaches the Curie temperature, the material undergoes a phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, and its magnetic susceptibility drops significantly.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the magnetic susceptibility and temperature of a ferromagnetic material is described by the Curie-Weiss law, and increasing the temperature reduces the magnetic properties of the material. When the temperature reaches the Curie temperature, the material loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic."
