    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 25°C, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nGiven the enthalpy of vaporization of water at 25°C, we can use the known vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) as a reference point. The vapor pressure of water at 100°C is 101.3 kPa (boiling point at sea level).\n\nΔHvap for water at 25°C is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol.\nR (ideal gas constant) = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nNow, we need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 373.15 K (100°C)\nT2 = 298.15 K (25°C)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -((40.7 * 10^3) / 8.314) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.3 * exp(-((40.7 * 10^3) / 8.314) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3.17 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3.17 kPa."
