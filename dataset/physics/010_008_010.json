    "message_2": "To find the volume of the metal block, we can use the principle of buoyancy. The apparent loss of weight of the block is equal to the buoyant force acting on it, which is given by:\n\nBuoyant force = weight of water displaced = weight of the block - apparent weight of the block\n\nWe are given that the apparent loss of weight is 80 grams, so:\n\nBuoyant force = 120 grams - 80 grams = 40 grams\n\nNow, we can use the formula for buoyant force:\n\nBuoyant force = volume of water displaced × density of water × acceleration due to gravity\n\nSince we are working with grams and specific gravity, we can ignore the acceleration due to gravity in this case, as it will cancel out in the calculations. The density of water is 1.0 g/cm³ (given as specific gravity of water). Therefore:\n\n40 grams = volume of water displaced × 1.0 g/cm³\n\nVolume of water displaced = 40 cm³\n\nSince the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the metal block, the volume of the metal block is 40 cm³."
