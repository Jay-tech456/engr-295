    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire measures 20 cm x 30 cm and is situated in the xy plane. The wire carries a current of 2 A in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point P located 10 cm above the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately, then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at point P.\n\nLet's label the four corners of the rectangle A, B, C, and D, with A at the origin (0, 0), B at (20 cm, 0), C at (20 cm, 30 cm), and D at (0, 30 cm). The current flows from A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A.\n\n1. Segment AB:\nThe differential length vector dl = dx i (in the positive x-direction), and the position vector r = (x i + 10 k) - (0 i + 0 j + 10 k) = x i. The distance r = x. The cross product dl x r = dx i x x i = 0 (since the cross product of parallel vectors is zero). Therefore, the magnetic field due to segment AB is zero.\n\n2. Segment BC:\nThe differential length vector dl = dy j (in the positive y-direction), and the position vector r = (20 i + y j + 10 k) - (20 i + 0 j + 10 k) = y j. The distance r = y. The cross product dl x r = dy j x y j = 0 (since the cross product of parallel vectors is zero). Therefore, the magnetic field due to segment BC is zero.\n\n3. Segment CD:\nThe differential length vector dl = -dx i (in the negative x-direction), and the position vector r = (-x i + 30 j + 10 k) - (0 i + 30 j + 10 k) = -x i. The distance r = x. The cross product dl x r = -dx i x -x i = 0 (since the cross product of parallel vectors is zero). Therefore, the magnetic field due to segment CD is zero.\n\n4. Segment DA:\nThe differential length vector dl = -dy j (in the negative y-direction), and the position vector r = (0 i + (30-y) j + 10 k) - (0 i + 30 j + 10 k) = -y j. The distance r = y. The cross product dl x r = -dy j x -y j = 0 (since the cross product of parallel vectors is zero). Therefore, the magnetic field due to segment DA is zero.\n\nSince the magnetic field due to each segment is zero, the total magnetic field at point P is also zero. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is 0 T, and there is no direction associated with it."
