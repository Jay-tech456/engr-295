    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, its existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter and its influence on the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies show that the mass distribution within these galaxies does not follow the distribution of visible matter. The rotation curves remain flat or even rise at large distances from the galactic center, indicating the presence of an unseen mass component, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter can bend light from distant galaxies due to its gravitational influence. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, has been observed in galaxy clusters, where the mass distribution inferred from lensing is much greater than the mass in visible matter alone.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Observations of the CMB reveal fluctuations in temperature that are consistent with the presence of dark matter. Theoretical models that include dark matter provide a better fit to the observed CMB data than models without it.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of cosmic structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n5. Galaxy cluster dynamics: The velocities of galaxies within galaxy clusters are higher than what would be expected based on the visible mass of the cluster. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational attraction to hold the galaxies together.\n\nThe presence of dark matter has a significant influence on the formation and evolution of galaxies:\n\n1. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxy formation. It collapses under its own gravity, forming dark matter halos that attract baryonic (normal) matter, leading to the formation of galaxies within these halos.\n\n2. The distribution and amount of dark matter in a galaxy can affect its morphology and dynamics. For example, the presence of a massive dark matter halo can stabilize a spiral galaxy, preventing it from evolving into an elliptical galaxy.\n\n3. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the hierarchical structure formation of the universe. Smaller dark matter halos merge to form larger ones, leading to the formation of galaxy groups, clusters, and superclusters.\n\n4. The interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter can influence the rate of star formation in galaxies. Dark matter can help funnel gas into the central regions of galaxies, promoting star formation.\n\nIn summary, dark matter is an essential component of our current understanding of the universe. Its presence is supported by multiple lines of evidence, and it plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies."
