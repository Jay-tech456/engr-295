    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to separate uranium-235 (U-235) and uranium-238 (U-238) using the gas diffusion technique, we need to consider the work done during the enrichment process. The energy required for enrichment is given by the formula:\n\nEnergy = Work * Enrichment Factor * Feed Mass\n\nThe enrichment factor can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEnrichment Factor = (Product Enrichment - Feed Enrichment) / (Feed Enrichment * (1 - Product Enrichment))\n\nWhere:\n- Product Enrichment is the desired enrichment level (4% or 0.04)\n- Feed Enrichment is the initial enrichment level (0.7% or 0.007)\n\nEnrichment Factor = (0.04 - 0.007) / (0.007 * (1 - 0.04))\nEnrichment Factor ≈ 5.34\n\nNow, we need to determine the feed mass required to achieve the desired enrichment level. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nFeed Mass = Product Mass * (Product Enrichment / (1 - Product Enrichment)) * (1 / Feed Enrichment - 1)\n\nAssuming we want to produce 1 kg of enriched uranium, we can calculate the feed mass as follows:\n\nFeed Mass = 1 * (0.04 / (1 - 0.04)) * (1 / 0.007 - 1)\nFeed Mass ≈ 7.29 kg\n\nNow that we have the enrichment factor and the feed mass, we can calculate the energy required for the enrichment process. The work required for the gas diffusion technique is approximately 2500 kWh per Separative Work Unit (SWU).\n\nEnergy = Work * Enrichment Factor * Feed Mass\nEnergy = 2500 kWh/SWU * 5.34 SWU * 7.29 kg\nEnergy ≈ 97,400 kWh\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy needed to separate uranium-235 and uranium-238 using the gas diffusion technique to achieve a 4% enrichment level from a feed material containing 0.7% U-235 is approximately 97,400 kWh."
