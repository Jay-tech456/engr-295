    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of an external electric field. In the hydrogen atom, the most significant Stark effect occurs for the n=2 energy level, which corresponds to the Balmer series of spectral lines. The Balmer series is associated with transitions from higher energy levels to the n=2 level.\n\nThe most significant Stark effect will be observed for the transition with the largest change in the electric dipole moment, which is the transition from n=3 to n=2 (3 → 2). This transition corresponds to the H-alpha line in the Balmer series.\n\nTo calculate the wavelength of this spectral line, we can use the Rydberg formula:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1² - 1/n2²)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹), n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, respectively.\n\nFor the H-alpha line (3 → 2 transition), n1 = 2 and n2 = 3:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/2² - 1/3²)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 * (1/4 - 1/9)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 * (5/36)\n\nNow, we can solve for λ:\n\nλ = 1 / (1.097 x 10^7 * 5/36)\nλ ≈ 6.563 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the spectral line that shows the most significant Stark effect in the hydrogen atom when subjected to an electric field of 10^3 V/m is approximately 656.3 nm."
