    "message_2": "In string theory, the scattering amplitudes of interacting particles can be computed using techniques borrowed from quantum field theory (QFT). However, there are some key differences between the two approaches. In string theory, particles are represented as one-dimensional strings rather than point-like objects, and the interactions between these strings are described by the worldsheet, a two-dimensional surface traced out by the strings as they propagate through spacetime.\n\nHere's a general outline of how scattering amplitudes can be computed in string theory using QFT techniques:\n\n1. Worldsheet representation: In string theory, the fundamental object is the string, and its dynamics are described by the worldsheet. The worldsheet is a two-dimensional surface that represents the string's propagation through spacetime. The interactions between strings occur when the worldsheets join or split.\n\n2. Vertex operators: In QFT, local interactions between particles are described by vertex operators. Similarly, in string theory, vertex operators are used to describe the interactions between strings. These operators are inserted at the points on the worldsheet where strings join or split.\n\n3. Path integral formulation: In QFT, the scattering amplitudes are computed using the path integral formulation, which involves summing over all possible paths that particles can take between initial and final states. In string theory, a similar approach is used, but instead of summing over particle paths, we sum over all possible worldsheets connecting the initial and final string configurations.\n\n4. Conformal field theory: The worldsheet dynamics in string theory are described by a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). This is a special type of quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations, which preserve angles but not necessarily distances. The techniques of CFT, such as operator product expansions and correlation functions, can be used to compute scattering amplitudes in string theory.\n\n5. Perturbation theory: In QFT, scattering amplitudes are often computed using perturbation theory, which involves expanding the amplitude in terms of a small coupling constant and summing over Feynman diagrams. In string theory, a similar approach can be used, but instead of Feynman diagrams, we sum over Riemann surfaces (the mathematical objects that describe worldsheets) with increasing genus (the number of handles on the surface). Each genus corresponds to a different order in the perturbation series.\n\n6. Integrating over moduli space: To compute the scattering amplitudes in string theory, we need to integrate over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This is the space of all possible shapes and sizes of the worldsheet, modulo conformal transformations. This integration is typically performed using techniques from algebraic geometry and complex analysis.\n\nBy following these steps and using the techniques of quantum field theory, it is possible to compute the scattering amplitudes of interacting particles in string theory. However, it is important to note that string theory is still an active area of research, and many aspects of the theory, including the computation of scattering amplitudes, are not yet fully understood."
