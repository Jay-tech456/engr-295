    "message_1": "What is the heat capacity of a substance when 200 Joules of heat is added to a 50 gram sample and its temperature increases by 10 degrees Celsius?",
    "message_2": "The heat capacity (C) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat added (in Joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nQ = 200 J\nm = 50 g\nΔT = 10 °C\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c) of the substance. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 200 J / (50 g × 10 °C)\nc = 200 J / 500 g°C\nc = 0.4 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the substance is 0.4 J/g°C."
