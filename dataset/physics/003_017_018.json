    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment, then multiply by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is 5 cm = 0.05 m. The current is 2 A. The center of the square is at a distance of half the diagonal from the midpoint of the segment. The diagonal of the square is given by:\n\nd = √(0.05² + 0.05²) = √(0.0025 + 0.0025) = √0.005 = 0.0707107 m\n\nSo, the distance from the midpoint of the segment to the center of the square is half the diagonal:\n\nr = 0.0707107 / 2 = 0.0353553 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one segment at the center of the square:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, dl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r. Therefore,\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\ndB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * 0.05 m * 0.0353553 m) / (0.0353553 m)³\n\ndB = (10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (0.00353553 A*m²) / (0.04419417 m³)\n\ndB = 7.994 × 10⁻⁹ T\n\nSince there are four segments in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center of the square is:\n\nB = 4 * dB = 4 * 7.994 × 10⁻⁹ T = 31.976 × 10⁻⁹ T ≈ 32 nT\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl your fingers in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. For the square loop, the magnetic field due to each segment will be pointing either upward or downward at the center. In this case, the magnetic field due to all four segments will be pointing in the same direction (either upward or downward).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 32 nT, and the direction is either upward or downward, depending on the direction of the current."
