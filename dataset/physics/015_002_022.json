    "message_2": "To determine the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase, which is given by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and t is the time until coalescence.\n\nHowever, to use this formula, we need to know the time until coalescence, which is not given in the problem. Additionally, the distance of the neutron star merger from Earth (130 million light-years) is not directly relevant to calculating the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nIf we had the time until coalescence, we could plug it into the formula and calculate the frequency. Alternatively, if we had the orbital frequency or the chirp mass of the system, we could use those to estimate the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves."
