    "message_2": "The maximum amount of exposure to cosmic rays that an astronaut can receive during a space mission without experiencing harmful effects on their health is determined by the dose limits set by various space agencies. One of the most commonly used dose limits is set by NASA, which has established a career limit for astronauts based on their age and sex to minimize the risk of radiation-induced cancer.\n\nNASA's career dose limits are expressed in units of Sievert (Sv), which is a measure of the biological effect of ionizing radiation. The limits are designed to keep the risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to cancer below 3% for astronauts. The dose limits vary depending on the astronaut's age and sex, ranging from 1 to 4 Sieverts (Sv) over their career.\n\nFor a single space mission, the dose limits are typically lower. For example, during a 6-month mission on the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts are exposed to an average dose rate of about 0.3 millisieverts (mSv) per day, which amounts to approximately 54 mSv over the entire mission. This is still well below the career dose limits.\n\nIt is important to note that these dose limits are based on the current understanding of the health risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure. As more research is conducted and our understanding of these risks evolves, the dose limits may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of exposure to cosmic rays that an astronaut can receive during a space mission without experiencing harmful effects on their health depends on their age, sex, and the duration of the mission. The dose limits set by NASA aim to keep the risk of radiation-induced cancer below 3% for astronauts throughout their career."
