    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of image currents. When a current-carrying wire is placed near an infinite conducting plane, it creates an image current in the plane that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This image current can be treated as a virtual current-carrying wire located at an equal distance on the other side of the plane.\n\nLet's denote the current in the wire as I and the distance from the wire to the conducting plane as d. In this case, I = 6 A and d = 2 cm = 0.02 m.\n\nNow, we have two current-carrying wires: the original wire and its image. The magnetic field strength at a point P located at a distance d from the original wire and its image can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law. For a long straight wire, the magnetic field strength at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the magnetic field strength due to the original wire at point P. The distance r1 from the original wire to point P is 2d:\n\nr1 = 2 * d = 2 * 0.02 m = 0.04 m\n\nB1 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r1) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nNext, we'll calculate the magnetic field strength due to the image wire at point P. The distance r2 from the image wire to point P is equal to the distance from the original wire to point P, which is r1:\n\nr2 = r1 = 0.04 m\n\nB2 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r2) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nSince the image current is opposite in direction to the original current, the magnetic field strength due to the image wire at point P will be opposite in direction to the magnetic field strength due to the original wire. Therefore, we can find the net magnetic field strength at point P by subtracting B2 from B1:\n\nB_net = B1 - B2 = 0\n\nThe magnetic field strength produced by a long straight wire carrying a current of 6 A at a distance of 2 cm from an infinite conducting plane is 0 T."
