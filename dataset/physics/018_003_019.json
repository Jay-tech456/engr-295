    "message_2": "The electroweak theory, which unifies the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, does not provide an exact prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson. However, it does set constraints on the possible mass range for the Higgs boson based on the precision measurements of other electroweak parameters. Before the discovery of the Higgs boson, these constraints suggested that its mass should be below 200 GeV/c² (gigaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared).\n\nIn 2012, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN announced the discovery of a new particle consistent with the Higgs boson. The mass of this particle was measured to be approximately 125 GeV/c², which is within the range allowed by the electroweak theory. This discovery confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and provided a crucial piece of evidence for the validity of the electroweak theory and the overall Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nFurther measurements and analyses at the LHC have continued to support the properties of the discovered Higgs boson, including its mass, as being consistent with the predictions of the electroweak theory. The discovery of the Higgs boson and the ongoing research at the LHC have deepened our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles in the universe."
