    "message_2": "To determine how much slower time will pass for twin A compared to twin B, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation is given by the following formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere:\n- Δt' is the time experienced by twin A (the moving twin)\n- Δt is the time experienced by twin B (the stationary twin)\n- v is the velocity of twin A relative to twin B\n- c is the speed of light\n\nLet's assume twin A travels at a speed v = 0.99c (99% the speed of light) for a total of 10 years (according to twin B's time) before returning to Earth. We can now calculate the time experienced by twin A:\n\nΔt' = (10 years) / √(1 - (0.99c)²/c²)\nΔt' ≈ (10 years) / √(1 - 0.9801)\nΔt' ≈ (10 years) / √(0.0199)\nΔt' ≈ 2.24 years\n\nSo, twin A would have experienced approximately 2.24 years of time during their journey, while twin B experienced 10 years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the age difference between the twins when twin A returns:\n\nAge difference = Δt - Δt'\nAge difference = 10 years - 2.24 years\nAge difference ≈ 7.76 years\n\nWhen twin A returns, there will be an age difference of approximately 7.76 years between the twins, with twin B being older."
