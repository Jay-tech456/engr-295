    "message_2": "Cooper pairs are formed in superconductors due to the attractive interaction between electrons mediated by lattice vibrations, known as phonons. This attractive interaction leads to the formation of bound electron pairs, which are called Cooper pairs. The formation of Cooper pairs is a key aspect of the BCS (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer) theory, which is the most widely accepted explanation for conventional superconductivity.\n\nIn a normal conductor, electrons move through the lattice and experience resistance due to scattering from impurities and lattice vibrations (phonons). This scattering leads to energy dissipation in the form of heat, which is why there is a finite resistance in normal conductors.\n\nIn a superconductor, below a certain critical temperature (Tc), the attractive interaction between electrons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. These pairs of electrons have a lower energy state than individual electrons, and they form a coherent quantum state known as a condensate. In this state, all the Cooper pairs move in unison and do not experience scattering from impurities or lattice vibrations.\n\nThe absence of scattering means that there is no energy dissipation, and hence, electrical current can flow with zero resistance. This phenomenon is known as superconductivity. The flow of Cooper pairs in a superconductor is described by a macroscopic wave function, which is a solution to the Ginzburg-Landau equations. This wave function also explains other properties of superconductors, such as the Meissner effect, where a superconductor expels magnetic fields from its interior.\n\nIn summary, Cooper pairs form in superconductors due to the attractive interaction between electrons mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). These pairs of electrons form a coherent quantum state, which allows them to move without scattering and energy dissipation. This enables electrical current to flow with zero resistance in superconductors."
