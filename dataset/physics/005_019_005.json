    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at 0.8c relative to Earth, and it emits a beam of light with a frequency of 5.0 × 10^14 Hz in the forward direction. A second identical spaceship is traveling in the opposite direction at the same speed and also emits a beam of light with a frequency of 5.0 × 10^14 Hz. What is the frequency of the interference pattern observed by an observer on Earth when the two beams overlap?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for the frequency of light observed by a stationary observer when the source is moving. The formula is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * ( (c + v_relative) / (c - v_relative) )^(+/- 1/2)\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_source is the source frequency, c is the speed of light, v_relative is the relative velocity of the source, and the +1/2 or -1/2 exponent is used for approaching (+) or receding (-) sources.\n\nFor the first spaceship (approaching):\nf1_observed = (5.0 × 10^14 Hz) * ( (3.0 × 10^8 m/s + 0.8 * 3.0 × 10^8 m/s) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s - 0.8 * 3.0 × 10^8 m/s) )^(1/2)\n\nFor the second spaceship (receding):\nf2_observed = (5.0 × 10^14 Hz) * ( (3.0 × 10^8 m/s - 0.8 * 3.0 × 10^8 m/s) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s + 0.8 * 3.0 × 10^8 m/s) )^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in frequency between the two observed frequencies to determine the interference pattern frequency:\n\nΔf = |f1_observed - f2_observed|\n\nCalculating the observed frequencies:\n\nf1_observed ≈ 5.0 × 10^14 Hz * (1.8 / 1.2)^(1/2) ≈ 5.0 × 10^14 Hz * 1.22474487 ≈ 6.12372435 × 10^14 Hz\n\nf2_observed ≈ 5.0 × 10^14 Hz * (1.2 / 1.8)^(-1/2) ≈ 5.0 × 10^14 Hz * 0.81649658 ≈ 4.0824829 × 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, find the difference in frequency:\n\nΔf = |6.12372435 × 10^14 Hz - 4.0824829 × 10^14 Hz| ≈ 2.04124145 × 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the interference pattern observed by an observer on Earth when the two beams overlap is approximately 2.04 × 10^14 Hz."
