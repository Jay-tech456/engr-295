    "message_2": "The maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs is given by the Carnot efficiency, which is determined by the temperatures of the reservoirs. The Carnot efficiency is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 400 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 400 K)\nEfficiency = 1 - 0.75\nEfficiency = 0.25\n\nThe maximum possible efficiency of the heat engine is 25%."
