    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of production and detection of a W' or Z' boson in a high-energy particle collision at the LHC, we need to know the cross-section (σ) of the process and the integrated luminosity (L) of the experiment. The number of expected events (N) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nN = σ × L\n\nThe cross-section (σ) depends on the specific model and parameters of the W' or Z' boson, such as its mass and couplings to other particles. The integrated luminosity (L) is a measure of the total number of collisions in the experiment and is usually given in units of inverse femtobarns (fb⁻¹).\n\nOnce we have the number of expected events (N), we can estimate the probability of detection by considering the efficiency (ε) of the detector and the branching ratio (BR) of the decay modes of interest. The number of detected events (N_det) can be calculated as:\n\nN_det = N × ε × BR\n\nThe efficiency (ε) depends on the specific detector and its ability to identify and reconstruct the particles produced in the decay of the W' or Z' boson. The branching ratio (BR) is the fraction of the total decay width of the particle that corresponds to a specific decay mode.\n\nAs for the expected decay modes and partial widths of the W' and Z' bosons, these depend on the specific model and parameters of the particles. In general, W' and Z' bosons are expected to decay into a pair of Standard Model particles, such as quarks or leptons. Some possible decay modes for a W' boson include:\n\n- W' → u + d\n- W' → c + s\n- W' → e⁺ + ν_e\n- W' → μ⁺ + ν_μ\n\nFor a Z' boson, some possible decay modes include:\n\n- Z' → u + u\n- Z' → d + d\n- Z' → e⁺ + e⁻\n- Z' → μ⁺ + μ⁻\n\nThe partial widths of these decay modes depend on the couplings of the W' and Z' bosons to the corresponding particles, as well as their masses. To calculate the partial widths, one would typically use perturbation theory and the relevant Feynman rules for the specific model of the W' and Z' bosons.\n\nIn summary, to determine the probability of production and detection of a W' or Z' boson at the LHC, one needs to know the cross-section, integrated luminosity, detector efficiency, and branching ratios of the decay modes of interest. The expected decay modes and partial widths of these new heavy particles depend on the specific model and parameters of the W' and Z' bosons."
