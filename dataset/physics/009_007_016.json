    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula for concave mirrors.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: m = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the mirror\nu = object distance (distance of the object from the mirror)\nv = image distance (distance of the image from the mirror)\nm = magnification\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (concave mirror, so focal length is positive)\nu = -30 cm (object is in front of the mirror, so object distance is negative)\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-30v = -20v + 20*(-30)\n\nNow, simplify and solve for v:\n\n-10v = -600\nv = 60 cm\n\nThe image distance is positive, which means the image is formed on the same side as the object, and it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\n\nm = -v/u\nm = -60/(-30)\nm = 2\n\nThe magnification is 2, which means the image is twice the size of the object and is inverted (since the magnification is positive).\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is:\n1. Positioned 60 cm in front of the mirror (real image)\n2. Twice the size of the object (magnification of 2)\n3. Inverted (positive magnification)"
