    "message_1": "A convex mirror has a focal length of 20 cm. If an object is placed 30 cm away from the mirror, what will be the image distance and magnification produced by the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification produced by the convex mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/v + 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nFor a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. So, f = -20 cm.\n\nThe object distance, u = -30 cm (negative because the object is in front of the mirror).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v + 1/(-30)\n\nMultiplying through by -60 to clear the fractions, we get:\n\n3 = -2v + v\n\nSolving for v, we find:\n\nv = -60 cm\n\nThe image distance is -60 cm, which means the image is formed 60 cm behind the mirror (negative sign indicates it's a virtual image).\n\nNow, we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nm = (-60)/(-30)\n\nm = 2\n\nThe magnification produced by the convex mirror is 2, which means the image is twice the size of the object."
