    "message_2": "To find the total force exerted by the water on the tank's bottom, we can use the formula:\n\nForce = Pressure × Area\n\nThe area of the tank's bottom can be calculated as:\n\nArea = Length × Width = 1.5 m × 1 m = 1.5 m²\n\nGiven the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank is 200 kPa, we can convert it to Pascals (Pa) by multiplying by 1000:\n\nPressure = 200 kPa × 1000 = 200,000 Pa\n\nNow we can find the total force exerted by the water on the tank's bottom:\n\nForce = Pressure × Area = 200,000 Pa × 1.5 m² = 300,000 N\n\nSo, the total force exerted by the water on the tank's bottom is 300,000 Newtons."
