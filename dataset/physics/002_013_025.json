    "message_1": "A Carnot heat engine operates between two heat reservoirs at temperatures 300 K and 600 K respectively. Calculate the maximum efficiency of the engine if it absorbs heat at a rate of 400 J/s. Also, calculate the rate at which it rejects heat to the low-temperature reservoir.",
    "message_2": "The maximum efficiency of a Carnot heat engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_low / T_high)\n\nwhere T_low and T_high are the temperatures of the low-temperature and high-temperature reservoirs, respectively. In this case, T_low = 300 K and T_high = 600 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 600 K) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nNow, we know that the engine absorbs heat at a rate of 400 J/s. To find the rate at which it converts this heat into work, we can use the formula:\n\nWork rate = Efficiency × Heat absorption rate\n\nWork rate = 0.5 × 400 J/s = 200 J/s\n\nThe engine converts 200 J/s of the absorbed heat into work. The remaining heat is rejected to the low-temperature reservoir. To find the rate at which the engine rejects heat, we can use the formula:\n\nHeat rejection rate = Heat absorption rate - Work rate\n\nHeat rejection rate = 400 J/s - 200 J/s = 200 J/s\n\nSo, the maximum efficiency of the Carnot heat engine is 50%, and it rejects heat to the low-temperature reservoir at a rate of 200 J/s."
