    "message_2": "To determine the angle at which the first minimum of the diffraction pattern occurs, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the laser beam, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven:\nλ = 632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\na = 0.5 mm = 0.5 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\nm = 1 (for the first minimum)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 632.8 * 10^(-9)) / (0.5 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 1.2656 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(1.2656 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 1.2656 * 10^(-6) radians (since the angle is very small, sin(θ) ≈ θ in radians)\n\nNow, let's convert the angle from radians to degrees:\n\nθ ≈ (1.2656 * 10^(-6) * 180) / π\n\nθ ≈ 7.25 * 10^(-5) degrees\n\nSo, the angle at which the first minimum of the diffraction pattern occurs is approximately 7.25 * 10^(-5) degrees."
