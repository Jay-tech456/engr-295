    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic energy and momentum of the particle, we can use the following equations from relativistic quantum mechanics:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E): E = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n2. Relativistic momentum (p): p = mv / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nHere, m is the rest mass of the particle, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nRest mass (m) = 2.5 GeV/c²\nVelocity (v) = 0.8c\n\nFirst, let's calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = (2.5 GeV/c²) * c² / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nE = 2.5 GeV / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE = 2.5 GeV / sqrt(0.36)\nE = 2.5 GeV / 0.6\nE = 4.1667 GeV\n\nNow, let's calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = (2.5 GeV/c²) * (0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\np = 2 GeV/c / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = 2 GeV/c / sqrt(0.36)\np = 2 GeV/c / 0.6\np = 3.3333 GeV/c\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the particle is 4.1667 GeV, and its relativistic momentum is 3.3333 GeV/c."
