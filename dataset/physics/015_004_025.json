    "message_2": "To estimate the energy released in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / (5 * R)\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the supernova, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the supernova.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the supernova from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the supernova is:\n\nM = 20 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from light-years to meters. One light-year is approximately 9.461 x 10^15 meters. Therefore, the distance to the supernova is:\n\nR = 10,000 light-years * (9.461 x 10^15 m/light-year) = 9.461 x 10^19 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5 * 9.461 x 10^19 m)\nE ≈ 1.27 x 10^46 J\n\nHowever, this formula gives us the total energy released, and we are interested in the energy released in gravitational waves over a duration of 10 seconds. To find this, we can use the following formula:\n\nE_gw = E * (t_gw / t_total)\n\nwhere E_gw is the energy released in gravitational waves, t_gw is the duration of the emission of gravitational waves (10 seconds), and t_total is the total duration of the supernova explosion. Since the total duration of a supernova explosion is not given, we cannot accurately calculate the energy released in gravitational waves over the 10-second duration. However, we can provide an estimate if we assume that the total duration of the supernova explosion is on the order of 10 seconds. In this case, the energy released in gravitational waves would be approximately:\n\nE_gw ≈ 1.27 x 10^46 J\n\nThis is a rough estimate, and the actual energy released in gravitational waves could be different depending on the specific properties of the supernova explosion and the total duration of the event."
