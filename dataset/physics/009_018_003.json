    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 600 nm is shone at a double-slit with a separation distance of 0.2 mm. If the interference pattern is projected onto a screen 1 m away, what is the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe, we can use the formula for the angular position of dark fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nθ = (m + 1/2) * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the dark fringe, m is the order of the fringe (0 for the central bright fringe, 1 for the first dark fringe, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the separation distance between the slits.\n\nFor the first dark fringe (m = 1):\n\nθ = (1 + 1/2) * (λ / d)\nθ = (3/2) * (600 nm / 0.2 mm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units to be consistent. Let's convert the wavelength to mm:\n\n600 nm = 0.0006 mm\n\nNow, we can plug the values back into the formula:\n\nθ = (3/2) * (0.0006 mm / 0.2 mm)\nθ ≈ 0.0045 radians\n\nNow that we have the angular position of the first dark fringe, we can find the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe on the screen using the small angle approximation:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe, L is the distance between the double-slit and the screen, and θ is the angular position of the first dark fringe.\n\ny = 1 m * tan(0.0045 radians)\ny ≈ 1 m * 0.0045\ny ≈ 0.0045 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe is approximately 0.0045 meters or 4.5 millimeters."
