    "message_2": "To find the force required to stretch the DNA molecule, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force (F) exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement (x) from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = k * x\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (100 piconewtons per nanometer in this case) and x is the displacement.\n\nFirst, we need to find the displacement (x). Since we want to stretch the DNA molecule to 1.5 times its original length, the new length will be:\n\nNew length = 1.5 * original length = 1.5 * 34 nm = 51 nm\n\nThe displacement (x) is the difference between the new length and the original length:\n\nx = 51 nm - 34 nm = 17 nm\n\nNow we can use Hooke's Law to find the force (F):\n\nF = k * x = 100 pN/nm * 17 nm = 1700 piconewtons\n\nSo, the force required to stretch the DNA molecule to 1.5 times its original length is 1700 piconewtons."
