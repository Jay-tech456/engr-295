    "message_1": "A student is using a converging lens of focal length 20 cm to view an object placed 30 cm in front of the lens. If the height of the object is 5 cm, what is the height of the image formed by the lens? What is the magnification of the lens in this case?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nWe are given the focal length f = 20 cm and the object distance u = 30 cm. We can plug these values into the lens formula to find the image distance v.\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 600 / 50\nv = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v / u\n\nM = -12 / 30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. Now, we can find the height of the image (h') using the magnification formula:\n\nh' = M * h\n\nWhere h is the height of the object.\n\nh' = -0.4 * 5\nh' = -2 cm\n\nThe height of the image is 2 cm, and it is inverted (indicated by the negative sign). The magnification of the lens in this case is -0.4 (inverted and reduced in size)."
