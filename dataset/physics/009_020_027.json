    "message_2": "To find the angular separation between the first and second order spectra, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the spectrum, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines on the grating, and θ is the angle of diffraction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 3000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 3000 lines per centimeter = 1 / 30000 lines per meter\n\nd = 1 / 30000 m = 3.33 x 10^-5 m\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the angles for the first (n=1) and second (n=2) order spectra:\n\nFor n = 1:\n\n1 * 600 x 10^-9 m = 3.33 x 10^-5 m * sin(θ1)\n\nSolving for θ1:\n\nsin(θ1) = (600 x 10^-9 m) / (3.33 x 10^-5 m)\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.018) ≈ 1.03°\n\nFor n = 2:\n\n2 * 600 x 10^-9 m = 3.33 x 10^-5 m * sin(θ2)\n\nSolving for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1200 x 10^-9 m) / (3.33 x 10^-5 m)\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.036) ≈ 2.06°\n\nNow, we can find the angular separation between the first and second order spectra:\n\nΔθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 2.06° - 1.03° ≈ 1.03°\n\nSo, the angular separation between the first and second order spectra is approximately 1.03°."
