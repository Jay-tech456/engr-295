    "message_2": "The mass of dark matter particles composed of gravitinos depends on the underlying supersymmetry model and the parameters involved. Gravitinos are hypothetical particles that are the supersymmetric partners of gravitons, the particles that mediate the gravitational force. In some models, gravitinos are considered as potential dark matter candidates.\n\nTo estimate the mass of gravitinos, we need to consider the density of dark matter in the universe. The current dark matter density is approximately 0.3 GeV/cmÂ³. If gravitinos account for 100% of the dark matter, their mass should be such that they can contribute to this density.\n\nThe mass of gravitinos can range from a few eV (electron volts) to several TeV (tera electron volts) depending on the supersymmetry breaking scale. In some models, gravitinos with a mass of around 1 keV (kilo electron volt) to 100 GeV (giga electron volt) can be consistent with the observed dark matter density.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the exact mass of gravitinos and their contribution to the dark matter density is still an open question in theoretical physics. More experimental and observational data are needed to constrain the supersymmetry models and determine the properties of gravitinos."
