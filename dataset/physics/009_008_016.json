    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram and determine the location and height of the image, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the principal axis (a horizontal line) and the concave mirror (a vertical line) on the left side of the axis.\n2. Mark the focal point (F) and the center of curvature (C) on the principal axis. Since the focal length is 15 cm, F is 15 cm to the right of the mirror, and C is twice the focal length, which is 30 cm to the right of the mirror.\n3. Draw the object (a vertical arrow) 30 cm to the right of the mirror, which is at the same position as the center of curvature (C).\n4. Draw three rays from the top of the object:\n   a. A parallel ray to the principal axis, which reflects through the focal point (F).\n   b. A ray passing through the focal point (F), which reflects parallel to the principal axis.\n   c. A ray passing through the center of curvature (C), which reflects back on itself.\n5. The point where all three rays intersect after reflection is the location of the image's top. Since the object is at the center of curvature, the rays will intersect at the same point, and the image will be formed at the same distance from the mirror (30 cm).\n\nNow, let's determine the height of the image:\n\nSince the object is at the center of curvature, the image will be the same size as the object. Therefore, the height of the image is 4 cm.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed at the center of curvature, 30 cm from the mirror, and has a height of 4 cm. The image is real, inverted, and the same size as the object."
