    "message_2": "Varying the incident X-ray angle affects the diffraction pattern of a crystal by changing the conditions under which constructive interference occurs. This is described by Bragg's Law, which states that constructive interference occurs when:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the spacing between the planes of atoms in the crystal, and θ is the angle of incidence of the X-rays.\n\nAs the incident angle (θ) changes, the conditions for constructive interference change, leading to a different diffraction pattern. By analyzing these diffraction patterns at various angles, it is possible to determine the crystal's lattice parameters.\n\nTo determine the lattice parameters from the diffraction patterns, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Measure the angles (θ) at which constructive interference occurs (i.e., where diffraction peaks are observed).\n2. Use Bragg's Law to calculate the corresponding d-spacing values for each observed peak.\n3. Identify the Miller indices (h, k, l) associated with each observed peak. These are integers that describe the orientation of the diffracting planes in the crystal lattice.\n4. Use the d-spacing values and Miller indices to calculate the lattice parameters (a, b, c) of the crystal. For a cubic lattice, for example, the relationship between d-spacing and lattice parameters is given by:\n\nd = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\n\nBy analyzing the diffraction patterns at various incident angles and applying the above steps, the lattice parameters of the crystal can be determined, providing valuable information about the crystal's structure and properties."
