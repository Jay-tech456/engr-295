    "message_1": "A physics student is trying to design an optical fiber that can carry laser light of wavelength 800 nm without losing any of the light due to absorption or scattering. The fiber has a core of refractive index n=1.50 and a cladding of refractive index n=1.45. What should be the minimum angle of incidence for the laser light at the core–cladding interface so that total internal reflection occurs and the light remains confined within the core?",
    "message_2": "For total internal reflection to occur, the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90°, so sin(θ2) = 1. Therefore, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 / n1\n\nPlugging in the given refractive indices:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.45 / 1.50\n\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.9667\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.9667)\n\nθ1 ≈ 74.2°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for the laser light at the core-cladding interface should be greater than 74.2° for total internal reflection to occur and the light to remain confined within the core."
