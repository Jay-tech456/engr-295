    "message_1": "A coaxial cable carries a current of 10 A along its inner conductor. The radius of the inner conductor is 0.5 cm and the radius of the outer conductor is 1.0 cm. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the coaxial cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the problem is cylindrically symmetric, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius of 0.8 cm. The magnetic field will be tangent to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral simplifies to:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nWe are given that the current in the inner conductor is 10 A. Since the radial distance of 0.8 cm is between the inner and outer conductors, the enclosed current is 10 A. The permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB * 2π(0.008 m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2π * 0.008 m)\n\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
