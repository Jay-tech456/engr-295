    "message_2": "The tau lepton, also known as the tau particle or simply tau (τ), is a negatively charged elementary particle and the heaviest of the three leptons (electron, muon, and tau). It has a mass of approximately 1.78 GeV/c², which is about 3470 times heavier than the electron and 17 times heavier than the muon. Due to its larger mass, the tau lepton has a much shorter lifetime (around 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds) and can decay into a wider range of particles compared to the electron and muon.\n\nThe decay modes of a tau lepton can be broadly classified into two categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (either an electron or a muon) and two neutrinos (one tau neutrino and one electron or muon antineutrino). The leptonic decay modes are:\n\n   a) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̄_τ (tau decays into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a tau neutrino)\n   b) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̄_τ (tau decays into a muon, a muon antineutrino, and a tau neutrino)\n\n2. Hadronic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes primarily involve the production of one or more pions or kaons. Some examples of hadronic decays are:\n\n   a) τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ (tau decays into a charged pion and a tau neutrino)\n   b) τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁰ + ν_τ (tau decays into a charged pion, a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino)\n   c) τ⁻ → K⁻ + ν_τ (tau decays into a charged kaon and a tau neutrino)\n\nIn contrast, the electron is stable and does not decay, while the muon decays primarily through the following leptonic decay mode:\n\n   μ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̄_μ (muon decays into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino)\n\nThe muon does not have any hadronic decay modes due to its lower mass compared to the tau lepton. The key difference between the decay modes of tau leptons and those of electrons or muons is the presence of hadronic decay modes for tau leptons, which are absent for electrons and muons."
