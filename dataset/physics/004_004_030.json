Use this equation to calculate the deflection of starlight as it passes close to a massive object, as predicted by General Relativity.

    "message_2": "To find the equation of the geodesic for a light ray traveling through the spacetime fabric in the vicinity of a massive object, we will use the Schwarzschild metric. The Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the massive object, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nFor a light ray, ds² = 0. We can rewrite the metric equation as:\n\n0 = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nSince we are interested in the deflection of starlight, we can assume that the motion is in the equatorial plane (θ = π/2). This simplifies the equation to:\n\n0 = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)dr² + r² dφ²\n\nNow, let's introduce two conserved quantities: the energy per unit mass E and the angular momentum per unit mass L, which are given by:\n\nE = (1 - 2GM/c²r) dt/ds\nL = r² dφ/ds\n\nWe can rewrite the metric equation in terms of E and L:\n\n0 = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)(ds/dt)² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)(dr/ds)² + r² (dφ/ds)²\n\nUsing the conserved quantities, we can rewrite this as:\n\n0 = -c² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)(dr/dt)² + (L²/r²)(1 - 2GM/c²r)\n\nNow, we can solve for dr/dt:\n\n(dr/dt)² = c²(1 - 2GM/c²r) - L²/r²(1 - 2GM/c²r)\n\nTo find the deflection of starlight, we need to find the change in the azimuthal angle φ as the light ray passes close to the massive object. We can do this by integrating dr/dt with respect to φ:\n\n∫(dr/dφ)² dφ = ∫(dr/dt)² (dt/dφ)² dφ\n\nUsing the conserved quantities, we can rewrite this as:\n\n∫(dr/dφ)² dφ = ∫(c²(1 - 2GM/c²r) - L²/r²(1 - 2GM/c²r)) (r²/L²) dφ\n\nLet u = 1/r, then du/dφ = -dr/dφ. The integral becomes:\n\n∫(du/dφ)² dφ = ∫(c²(1 - 2GMu/c²) - L²u²(1 - 2GMu/c²)) (1/L²) dφ\n\nIntegrating this equation and solving for the change in φ, we can find the deflection of starlight as it passes close to a massive object:\n\nΔφ = 4GM/c²b\n\nwhere b is the impact parameter, which is the distance of closest approach in the absence of gravity.\n\nThis equation shows that the deflection of starlight as it passes close to a massive object, as predicted by General Relativity, is proportional to the mass of the object (M) and inversely proportional to the impact parameter (b)."
