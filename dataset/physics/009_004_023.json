    "message_1": "A light ray travels from air (n=1.00) into a material with a refractive index of 1.50. What is the critical angle for the interface between these two media?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for the interface between air (n1 = 1.00) and the material with a refractive index of 1.50 (n2), we can use Snell's Law. Snell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nAt the critical angle, the light ray will be refracted at an angle of 90 degrees (θ2 = 90°) along the interface between the two media. In this case, sin(θ2) = sin(90°) = 1.\n\nNow, we can rearrange Snell's Law to find the critical angle (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 / n1\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.50 / 1.00\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.50\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 1.50:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1.50)\n\nHowever, the value of sin(θ) must be between -1 and 1, and 1.50 is outside this range. This means that there is no critical angle for the given refractive indices, and the light will always be refracted when entering the material with a refractive index of 1.50."
