    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (∆G) for the binding of protein (ubiquitin) and ligand (ubiquitin-binding domain of ABIN-1) at a temperature of 298 K, we need to know the values of the equilibrium constant (K) or the association constant (Ka) for the binding reaction, as well as the concentrations of the reactants and products. Unfortunately, these values are not provided in the question.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the general formula to calculate ∆G for a reaction under standard state conditions:\n\n∆G = -RT ln(K)\n\nWhere:\n∆G = change in free energy\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (298 K in this case)\nK = equilibrium constant or association constant for the binding reaction\n\nOnce you have the value of K, you can plug it into the formula along with the given temperature and gas constant to calculate the change in free energy for the binding of ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-binding domain of ABIN-1."
