    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a high-energy photon interacting with a target nucleus within a given distance, we need to consider the cross-section of the interaction. The cross-section (σ) represents the effective area in which the interaction can occur. For photon-nucleus interactions, the most relevant process is the photonuclear effect, where a photon is absorbed by the nucleus, causing it to emit a particle (usually a neutron or proton).\n\nThe probability (P) of interaction can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nP = 1 - exp(-nσL)\n\nwhere n is the number density of target nuclei, σ is the cross-section of the interaction, and L is the given distance.\n\nThe cross-section depends on the energy of the photon and the target nucleus. For high-energy photons, you can refer to experimental data or theoretical models to find the appropriate cross-section value.\n\nNow, let's consider the momentum transfer in such an interaction. The initial momentum of the photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\np_photon = E_photon / c\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the photon and c is the speed of light.\n\nWhen the photon interacts with the nucleus, it transfers some or all of its momentum to the nucleus and the emitted particle. The expected value of the momentum transfer depends on the details of the interaction, such as the mass and energy of the emitted particle and the recoil of the nucleus. In general, the momentum transfer can be calculated using conservation of momentum and energy principles.\n\nTo find the expected value of the momentum transfer, you would need to average the momentum transfer over all possible outcomes of the interaction, weighted by their probabilities. This would typically involve integrating over the possible final states of the system, taking into account the cross-section for each outcome.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the probability of a high-energy photon interacting with a target nucleus within a given distance, you need to know the cross-section of the interaction, the number density of target nuclei, and the given distance. To find the expected value of the momentum transfer, you need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy principles and average over all possible outcomes of the interaction."
