    "message_1": "What is the distance between an object and a concave mirror if the resulting real image is twice the size of the object and located 20 cm from the mirror? The focal length of the mirror is 10 cm.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula for concave mirrors.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = 10 cm\nReal image distance (v) = 20 cm (real image, so positive)\nMagnification (M) = 2 (twice the size of the object)\n\nFirst, we can find the object distance (u) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n2 = -20/u\nu = -20/2\nu = -10 cm (negative sign indicates that the object is on the same side as the mirror)\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to verify the result:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/(-10) + 1/20\n1/10 = -1/10 + 1/20\n1/10 = -2/20 + 1/20\n1/10 = -1/20\n\nThe result is not consistent with the mirror formula. This indicates that the given problem has no solution with the provided parameters. In a concave mirror, it is not possible to have a real image that is twice the size of the object with a focal length of 10 cm and an image distance of 20 cm."
