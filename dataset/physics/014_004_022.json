    "message_2": "The estimated age of the universe based on observations of the oldest known galaxies and the widely accepted cosmological model, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is approximately 13.8 billion years. This estimation is derived from various observations, including the Hubble constant, which measures the expansion rate of the universe, and the distribution of large-scale cosmic structures.\n\nThis age estimate is consistent with other independent measurements of the age of the universe, such as those based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only 380,000 years old. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations and patterns in the CMB, scientists can infer the age of the universe. The Planck satellite mission, which provided the most precise measurements of the CMB to date, also estimated the age of the universe to be around 13.8 billion years.\n\nThese consistent age estimates from different methods and observations provide strong evidence for the current understanding of the age of the universe."
