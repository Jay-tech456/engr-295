    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at a velocity of 0.9c relative to Earth has a clock on board that measures its own time. If the clock on Earth reads 2 years, how much time has elapsed on the spaceship's clock? Also, find the time dilation factor (gamma).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity:\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\n\nwhere Δt is the time elapsed on Earth (2 years), Δt' is the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock, and γ is the time dilation factor (also known as the Lorentz factor).\n\nFirst, let's find the time dilation factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / √(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the time dilation factor, we can find the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock (Δt'):\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\nΔt' = 2 years / 2.294\nΔt' ≈ 0.872 years\n\nSo, approximately 0.872 years have elapsed on the spaceship's clock, and the time dilation factor (gamma) is approximately 2.294."
