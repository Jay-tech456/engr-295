    "message_2": "The Bethe-Bloch formula describes the energy loss per unit length (dE/dx) of a charged particle passing through a medium. The formula is given by:\n\ndE/dx = -K * z² * Z/A * ρ * (1/β²) * [ln(2 * me * c² * β² * γ² * Tmax / I²) - β²]\n\nwhere:\n- K is a constant equal to 0.307075 MeV * cm²/g\n- z is the charge of the particle (for a proton, z = 1)\n- Z is the atomic number of the medium (for aluminum, Z = 13)\n- A is the atomic mass of the medium (for aluminum, A = 27 g/mol)\n- ρ is the density of the medium (for aluminum, ρ = 2.7 g/cm³)\n- β is the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light (β = v/c)\n- γ is the Lorentz factor (γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²))\n- me is the electron mass (me = 0.511 MeV/c²)\n- c is the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- Tmax is the maximum kinetic energy transfer in a single collision\n- I is the mean excitation energy of the medium (for aluminum, I = 166 eV)\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity (β) and Lorentz factor (γ) for the 1 GeV proton. The proton mass (mp) is 938.272 MeV/c². The total energy (E) of the proton is 1000 MeV (1 GeV).\n\nγ = E / (mp * c²) = 1000 MeV / 938.272 MeV = 1.0657\nβ² = 1 - 1/γ² = 1 - 1/1.0657² = 0.0597\n\nNow we can find Tmax. For a proton, Tmax can be approximated as:\n\nTmax = 2 * me * c² * β² * γ² / (1 + 2 * γ * me / mp + (me / mp)²)\n\nTmax = 2 * 0.511 MeV * 0.0597 * 1.0657² / (1 + 2 * 1.0657 * 0.511 MeV / 938.272 MeV + (0.511 MeV / 938.272 MeV)²) = 0.0311 MeV\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the Bethe-Bloch formula:\n\ndE/dx = -0.307075 MeV * cm²/g * 1² * 13/27 * 2.7 g/cm³ * (1/0.0597) * [ln(2 * 0.511 MeV * 0.0597 * 1.0657² * 0.0311 MeV / 166 eV²) - 0.0597]\n\ndE/dx = -1.664 MeV/cm\n\nThe energy loss per unit length for a 1 GeV proton passing through 1 cm of aluminum is approximately 1.664 MeV/cm."
