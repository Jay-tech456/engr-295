    "message_1": "A satellite orbiting a black hole emits light signals. The signals are received by a researcher on a space station far away from the black hole. The gravitational field of the black hole causes the light from the satellite to have a longer wavelength. Calculate the gravitational redshift factor for the signals received by the researcher, given the mass of the black hole and the distance between the satellite and the black hole.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift factor, we can use the formula:\n\nz = (1 - 2GM/c^2R)^(-1/2) - 1\n\nwhere z is the redshift factor, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance between the satellite and the black hole.\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole (M) and the distance between the satellite and the black hole (R), we can plug these values into the formula and calculate the gravitational redshift factor (z)."
