    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of the copper nanowire, we can use the following formula:\n\nThermal conductivity (k) = (1/3) * C * v * L\n\nwhere C is the heat capacity per unit volume, v is the average velocity of the particles (electrons or phonons), and L is the mean free path.\n\nFor metals like copper, the thermal conductivity is mainly due to the electrons. Therefore, we will consider the electron mean free path (Le) and the electronic contribution to the heat capacity (Ce).\n\nThe heat capacity per unit volume (Ce) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nCe = n * kB * T\n\nwhere n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K), and T is the temperature.\n\nFor copper, the number of free electrons per unit volume (n) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nn = N * Z / V\n\nwhere N is the Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol), Z is the number of free electrons per atom (for copper, Z = 1), and V is the molar volume (for copper, V = 7.11 x 10^-6 m^3/mol).\n\nn = (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) * 1 / (7.11 x 10^-6 m^3/mol) = 8.47 x 10^28 electrons/m^3\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat capacity per unit volume (Ce):\n\nCe = (8.47 x 10^28 electrons/m^3) * (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) * 300 K = 3.51 x 10^6 J/m^3K\n\nNext, we need to find the average velocity of the electrons (ve). For copper, the Fermi velocity (vf) is approximately 1.57 x 10^6 m/s. The average velocity of the electrons (ve) is roughly half of the Fermi velocity:\n\nve = 0.5 * vf = 0.5 * 1.57 x 10^6 m/s = 7.85 x 10^5 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal conductivity (k) using the given electron mean free path (Le = 40 nm = 40 x 10^-9 m):\n\nk = (1/3) * Ce * ve * Le = (1/3) * (3.51 x 10^6 J/m^3K) * (7.85 x 10^5 m/s) * (40 x 10^-9 m) = 36.5 W/mK\n\nTherefore, the thermal conductivity of the copper nanowire with a diameter of 100 nm at a temperature of 300 K is approximately 36.5 W/mK."
