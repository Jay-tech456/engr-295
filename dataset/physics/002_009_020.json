    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to completely melt the 500g block of ice at 0°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = m * Lf\n\nwhere Q is the amount of heat required, m is the mass of the ice, and Lf is the latent heat of fusion of ice.\n\nGiven:\nm = 500g\nLf = 333.55 J/g\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\nQ = 500g * 333.55 J/g\n\nQ = 166775 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to completely melt the 500g block of ice at 0°C is 166,775 Joules."
