    "message_2": "The presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can cause the formation of a quasar through a process called accretion. When a large amount of gas and dust is present near the black hole, it forms an accretion disk around it. The material in the accretion disk is attracted by the black hole's strong gravitational pull and starts spiraling inward.\n\nAs the material in the accretion disk gets closer to the black hole, it becomes denser and heats up due to friction and compression. This heating causes the material to emit a tremendous amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. This intense radiation outshines the entire galaxy, making the quasar one of the most luminous objects in the universe.\n\nThe observable characteristics of quasars include:\n\n1. High luminosity: Quasars are extremely bright, with luminosities ranging from 10^39 to 10^41 watts. They can outshine entire galaxies and are visible across vast cosmic distances.\n\n2. Broad emission lines: Quasars exhibit broad emission lines in their spectra, which are caused by the high-speed motion of the gas in the accretion disk. These lines help astronomers identify quasars and study their properties.\n\n3. Radio emission: Many quasars emit strong radio waves, which are produced by charged particles moving at relativistic speeds in magnetic fields near the black hole. These radio emissions can be used to study the structure and dynamics of the quasar.\n\n4. Variability: Quasars can show significant variability in their brightness over time, ranging from days to years. This variability is due to changes in the accretion rate or the orientation of the accretion disk relative to our line of sight.\n\n5. High redshift: Quasars are typically found at high redshifts, which means they are located at significant distances from us. The redshift is a measure of the cosmic expansion and can be used to determine the age and distance of the quasar.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can cause the formation of a quasar through the accretion of surrounding material. Quasars are characterized by their high luminosity, broad emission lines, radio emission, variability, and high redshifts."
