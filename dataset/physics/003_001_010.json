    "message_2": "To find the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a distance away from a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, for a straight wire, Ampere's Law provides a simpler formula to calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 6.0 A and distance r = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6.0 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\nB = (24π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.08 m)\nB = 3π × 10^(-5) T\n\nB ≈ 9.42 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the strength of the magnetic field 4.0 cm away from the wire is approximately 9.42 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have a specific orientation for the wire, we can only say that the magnetic field will be circular and perpendicular to the wire, with the direction determined by the right-hand rule."
