    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by a merger of two neutron stars, we can use the inspiral phase of the merger as a starting point. During the inspiral phase, the two neutron stars orbit each other, gradually getting closer as they lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system. We can use Kepler's third law to estimate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * (G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nFor neutron stars with masses of 1.4 solar masses each, M1 = M2 = 1.4 * M_sun, where M_sun is the solar mass (approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg). The semi-major axis, a, is not directly given, but we can estimate the frequency range by considering the moments just before the merger.\n\nAs the neutron stars get closer, their orbital frequency increases. The frequency will be at its highest just before the merger, when the separation between the neutron stars is roughly equal to their combined radii. Neutron stars have radii of about 10-15 km, so we can use a value of a ≈ 20 km for the highest frequency.\n\nUsing these values, we can estimate the highest frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase:\n\nf_orbital_max = (1 / (2 * pi)) * (G * (2.8 * M_sun) / (20 km)^3)^(1/2)\n\nConverting the units and plugging in the values:\n\nf_orbital_max ≈ (1 / (2 * pi)) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (5.584 x 10^30 kg) / (20,000 m)^3)^(1/2)\nf_orbital_max ≈ 1570 Hz\n\nSince the frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency, the highest frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase is approximately:\n\nf_gravitational_max ≈ 2 * 1570 Hz ≈ 3140 Hz\n\nThe frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two neutron stars with masses of 1.4 solar masses each would be from a few Hz (for the early inspiral phase) up to around 3140 Hz (just before the merger). Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency range could be somewhat different depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbit."
