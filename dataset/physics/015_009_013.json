    "message_1": "What is the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system located 50 million light years away from Earth, given the masses and orbital parameters of the system?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we need to know the masses of the two neutron stars and their orbital parameters, such as the orbital period or the semi-major axis of the orbit. Please provide this information so that I can proceed with the calculations."
