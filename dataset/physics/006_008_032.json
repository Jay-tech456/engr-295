    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of an electron emitted from a sodium atom, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron, E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, and W is the work function of sodium.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy of the incident photon. We can use the equation:\n\nE_photon = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon (400 nm).\n\nConvert the wavelength to meters:\n\nλ = 400 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 4 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, calculate the energy of the photon:\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4 x 10^-7 m) = 4.969 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we can convert the energy to electron volts (eV):\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nE_photon = (4.969 x 10^-19 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.1 eV\n\nNow, we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W = 3.1 eV - 2.28 eV = 0.82 eV\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy of an electron emitted from a sodium atom when a photon with a wavelength of 400 nm is incident on its surface is 0.82 eV."
