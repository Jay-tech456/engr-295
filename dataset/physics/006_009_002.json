    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of a photon that undergoes Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, let's convert the scattering angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/6))\nΔλ ≈ 2.43 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we need to find the initial wavelength of the photon. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = (h * c) / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. We are given the initial energy of the photon as 511 keV, which we need to convert to joules:\n\nE = 511 keV * (1.602 x 10^-16 J/keV) = 8.187 x 10^-14 J\n\nNow, we can find the initial wavelength:\n\nλ_initial = (h * c) / E\nλ_initial ≈ 2.43 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can find the final wavelength:\n\nλ_final = λ_initial + Δλ\nλ_final ≈ 2.43 x 10^-12 m + 2.43 x 10^-12 m\nλ_final ≈ 4.86 x 10^-12 m\n\nFinally, we can find the final energy of the scattered photon using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE_final = (h * c) / λ_final\nE_final ≈ 4.09 x 10^-14 J\n\nTo convert the final energy back to keV:\n\nE_final = 4.09 x 10^-14 J * (1 keV / 1.602 x 10^-16 J)\nE_final ≈ 255.5 keV\n\nSo, the change in wavelength of the photon is approximately 2.43 x 10^-12 m, the final energy of the scattered photon is approximately 255.5 keV, and the final wavelength is approximately 4.86 x 10^-12 m."
