    "message_1": "A generator produces a current of 20 A in a wire that is wrapped around a circular coil consisting of 100 turns, each turn having an area of 20 cm². What is the magnetic field at the center of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current (I) passing through the loop. For a circular coil, the formula for the magnetic field at the center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the coil. Since we know the area (A) of each turn, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * R²\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for R:\n\nR = √(A / π)\n\nGiven that the area of each turn is 20 cm², we need to convert it to m²:\n\nA = 20 cm² * (1 m / 100 cm)² = 0.002 m²\n\nNow, we can find the radius:\n\nR = √(0.002 m² / π) ≈ 0.0252 m\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil using the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 20 A * 100 turns) / (2 * 0.0252 m)\n\nB ≈ (2.5 × 10⁻⁵ T * 2000) / 0.0504\n\nB ≈ 0.00998 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 0.00998 T or 9.98 mT."
