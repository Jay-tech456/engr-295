    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 3 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current in the wire (3 A), and r is the distance from the wire (2 cm = 0.02 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (12 × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A) / (0.04 m)\nB = 3 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the straight wire carrying a current of 3 A is 3 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla). The resistance of the resistor in the circuit does not affect the magnetic field calculation in this case."
