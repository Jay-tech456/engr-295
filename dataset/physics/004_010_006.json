    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) for a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, 10 solar masses would be:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^31 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 * 1.989 × 10^31) / (8.98755179 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (2.646 × 10^20) / (8.98755179 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.944 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a non-rotating black hole of mass 10 solar masses is approximately 2,944 meters or 2.944 kilometers."
