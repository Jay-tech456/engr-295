    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of an object, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the object and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v = 0.9c, so we have:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (2.294 - 1)(0.1 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 1.294(0.1 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 1.1646 x 10^16 J\n\nSo the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is approximately 1.1646 x 10^16 Joules."
