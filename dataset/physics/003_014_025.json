    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the loop in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a rectangular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a * b) / (4 * π * (a² + b² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a and b are the dimensions of the rectangular loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven:\nI = 2 A\na = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nb = 20 cm = 0.2 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m * 0.2 m) / (4 * π * (0.1² + 0.2² + 0.05²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.02 m²) / (4 * π * (0.01 + 0.04 + 0.0025)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1.6 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.0525^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-7) T / 0.0378\n\nB ≈ 4.23 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the loop in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the loop is approximately 4.23 × 10^(-6) T."
