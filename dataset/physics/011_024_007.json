    "message_2": "The bandgap of a topological insulator is a small energy gap that separates the valence band and the conduction band in the bulk of the material. This energy gap is typically on the order of a few milli-electron volts (meV) to a few electron volts (eV). The unique electronic properties of topological insulators arise from the existence of gapless, linearly dispersing surface states that cross this bandgap, which are protected by time-reversal symmetry and topological invariants.\n\nTo understand the differences between the energy spectra of conventional insulators, conductors, and topological insulators, let's briefly discuss each of them:\n\n1. Conventional insulators: In these materials, the valence band is completely filled with electrons, and the conduction band is empty. There is a significant energy gap between the valence and conduction bands, which prevents electrons from transitioning between the two bands. As a result, conventional insulators do not conduct electricity.\n\n2. Conductors: In conductors, the valence band and conduction band overlap, or the conduction band is partially filled with electrons. This allows electrons to move freely between the bands, resulting in high electrical conductivity.\n\n3. Topological insulators: These materials exhibit a unique combination of insulating and conducting properties. In the bulk, they behave like conventional insulators, with a small energy gap separating the valence and conduction bands. However, on their surfaces, topological insulators have gapless, linearly dispersing states that cross the bandgap. These surface states are protected by time-reversal symmetry and topological invariants, making them robust against impurities and defects. As a result, topological insulators can conduct electricity on their surfaces while remaining insulating in the bulk.\n\nIn summary, the energy spectra of conventional insulators, conductors, and topological insulators differ in the arrangement and occupancy of their valence and conduction bands. The unique electronic properties of topological insulators arise from the presence of protected surface states that cross the bandgap, allowing for surface conductivity while maintaining bulk insulation."
