    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.2 meters from a straight wire carrying a current of 5 A, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current through the wire,\nr is the distance from the wire.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field for a current of 5 A:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m)\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.2 m)\nB = 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.2 meters from the wire carrying a current of 5 A is 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nNow, let's see how the magnetic field changes when the current through the wire is increased to 10 A:\n\nB' = (μ₀ * I') / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B' is the new magnetic field and I' is the new current (10 A).\n\nB' = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m)\nB' = (4π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.2 m)\nB' = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.2 meters from the wire carrying a current of 10 A is 2 × 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nComparing the two magnetic fields, we can see that when the current is doubled, the magnetic field also doubles. This is because the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current, as shown in the formula:\n\nB ∝ I\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.2 meters from a straight wire carrying a current of 5 A is 10^(-6) Tesla, and when the current is increased to 10 A, the magnetic field doubles to 2 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
