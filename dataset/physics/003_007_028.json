    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P due to the current-carrying rod, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector along the rod, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the current, we can simplify the expression for the magnetic field as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sinθ) / r²\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression along the length of the rod to find the total magnetic field at point P. Let's assume that the rod is lying along the x-axis, with one end at x = 0 and the other end at x = 20 cm. Point P is located at a distance of 5 cm away from the rod, so its coordinates are (x, y) = (0, 5 cm).\n\nFor the integration, we can consider a small current element of length dx at position x along the rod. The distance r from this current element to point P is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + 5²)\n\nThe angle θ between dl and r is the same as the angle between the x-axis and r, so:\n\nsinθ = y / r = 5 / sqrt(x² + 5²)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the Biot-Savart law and integrate along the length of the rod:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = ∫[(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx * sinθ) / r²] from x = 0 to x = 20 cm\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫[(5 * dx) / (x² + 5²)^(3/2)] from x = 0 to x = 20 cm\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = x² + 5², then du = 2x dx. The integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (1/2) * ∫[5 / u^(3/2)] du from u = 5² to u = 20² + 5²\nB = (μ₀ * I / 8π) * ∫[5 / u^(3/2)] du from u = 25 to u = 425\n\nNow, the integral is straightforward to solve:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 8π) * [-10 * u^(-1/2)] from u = 25 to u = 425\nB = (μ₀ * I / 8π) * [-10 * (425^(-1/2) - 25^(-1/2))]\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2.5 A / 8π) * [-10 * (sqrt(1/425) - sqrt(1/25))]\nB ≈ 0.000025 * [-10 * (0.0483 - 0.2)]\nB ≈ -0.000025 * 7.585\nB ≈ -0.0001896 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.896 × 10⁻⁴ T. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing in the positive x-direction, the magnetic field at point P will be pointing into the plane (negative z-direction)."
