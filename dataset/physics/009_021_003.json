    "message_1": "A beam of light with a wavelength of 500 nm is incident on a polarizer. The intensity of the light passing through the polarizer is reduced to 20% of its initial value. What is the angle between the axis of transmission of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the axis of transmission of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis and the polarization direction of the incident light.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis and the polarization direction.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the transmitted intensity is 20% of the initial intensity, so:\n\nI = 0.2 * I₀\n\nNow, we can substitute this into Malus' Law equation:\n\n0.2 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I₀:\n\n0.2 = cos²(θ)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.2) = cos(θ)\n\nθ = arccos(sqrt(0.2))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 63.4°\n\nSo, the angle between the axis of transmission of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light is approximately 63.4°."
