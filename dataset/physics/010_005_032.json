    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the ball just before it hits the water, we can ignore the drag and lift forces since they only act when the ball is in the water. Instead, we will use the conservation of energy principle to find the velocity.\n\nWhen the ball is dropped from a height of 2 meters, it has potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as it falls. The potential energy (PE) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPE = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass of the ball (1 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height (2 meters).\n\nPE = 1 kg * 9.81 m/s² * 2 m = 19.62 J (joules)\n\nAs the ball falls, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (KE). The kinetic energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v²\n\nwhere m is the mass of the ball (1 kg) and v is the velocity.\n\nSince the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, we can set the two equal to each other:\n\n19.62 J = 0.5 * 1 kg * v²\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv² = 19.62 J / (0.5 * 1 kg)\nv² = 39.24\nv = √39.24\nv ≈ 6.26 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball just before it hits the water is approximately 6.26 m/s."
