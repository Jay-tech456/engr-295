    "message_1": "A student is asked to calculate the vapor pressure of water at 50°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The enthalpy of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol, and the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 3.17 kPa. What is the vapor pressure of water at 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nGiven:\nP1 = 3.17 kPa (vapor pressure at 25°C)\nT1 = 25°C = 298.15 K (converted to Kelvin)\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol (converted to Joules)\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K (converted to Kelvin)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 50°C.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nP2 = 3.17 kPa * exp(-40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K))\n\nP2 = 3.17 kPa * exp(-40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (-0.000937 K⁻¹))\n\nP2 = 3.17 kPa * exp(4.564)\n\nP2 ≈ 3.17 kPa * 96.01\n\nP2 ≈ 304.19 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 304.19 kPa."
