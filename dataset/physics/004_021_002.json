    "message_2": "The event horizon radius and the Schwarzschild radius are actually the same thing. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is defined as the distance from the center of the black hole at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius, we use the formula:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object (in this case, the mass of the Sun, which is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg), and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs ≈ 2.954 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius and the Schwarzschild radius for a star with the mass of the Sun undergoing gravitational collapse is approximately 2.954 kilometers."
