    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of performance (COP) and the rate of heat removal from the refrigerator, we can use the following formulas:\n\nCOP = Q_L / W\nQ_L = T_L * (Q_H - Q_L) / (T_H - T_L)\nW = Q_H - Q_L\n\nwhere:\n- COP is the coefficient of performance\n- Q_L is the rate of heat removal from the refrigerator (in J/s)\n- Q_H is the rate of heat rejection to the environment (in J/s)\n- W is the work done by the refrigerator (in J/s)\n- T_L is the lower temperature (in Kelvin)\n- T_H is the higher temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT_L = -20°C + 273.15 = 253.15 K\nT_H = 4°C + 273.15 = 277.15 K\n\nWe are given that the refrigerator consumes 1000 J of work per second (W = 1000 J/s). We can use this information to find Q_L and Q_H.\n\nFrom the formula W = Q_H - Q_L, we can write Q_H as:\n\nQ_H = W + Q_L\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Q_H in the formula for Q_L:\n\nQ_L = T_L * (W + Q_L) / (T_H - T_L)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Q_L:\n\nQ_L * (T_H - T_L) = T_L * (W + Q_L)\n\nQ_L * T_H - Q_L * T_L = T_L * W + T_L * Q_L\n\nQ_L * T_H - T_L * Q_L = T_L * W\n\nQ_L * (T_H - T_L) = T_L * W\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_L:\n\nQ_L = T_L * W / (T_H - T_L)\nQ_L = 253.15 K * 1000 J/s / (277.15 K - 253.15 K)\nQ_L = 253.15 * 1000 / 24\nQ_L ≈ 10547.92 J/s\n\nNow that we have Q_L, we can find the coefficient of performance (COP):\n\nCOP = Q_L / W\nCOP = 10547.92 J/s / 1000 J/s\nCOP ≈ 10.55\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is approximately 10.55, and the rate of heat removal from the refrigerator is approximately 10547.92 J/s."
