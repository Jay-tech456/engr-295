    "message_2": "To find the distance between the two slits, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the bright fringe from the central maximum, m is the order of the fringe (m = 2 for the second bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of light, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nGiven the angle θ = 30 degrees and the wavelength λ = 500 nm, we can rearrange the formula to solve for d:\n\nd = (m * λ) / sin(θ)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ_rad = (30 * π) / 180 = π / 6\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nd = (2 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / sin(π / 6)\n\nd ≈ (1000 * 10^(-9)) / 0.5\n\nd ≈ 2000 * 10^(-9) m\n\nd ≈ 2 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits is approximately 2 micrometers (2 * 10^(-6) m)."
