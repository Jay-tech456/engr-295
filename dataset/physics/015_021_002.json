    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk, we need to consider the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. The formula for the gravitational wave amplitude is given by:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (dE/dt) / r\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, dE/dt is the rate of energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the accreting matter in the disk. The orbital frequency, f, can be calculated using the Kepler's third law:\n\nf = (1/2π) * √(GM/R^3)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, R is the distance from the center of the black hole to the accreting matter, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency:\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole, M = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nThe spinning rate is 5000 rotations per minute, which is 5000/60 = 83.33 rotations per second.\n\nAssuming the accreting matter is orbiting at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around a non-rotating black hole (Schwarzschild black hole), the radius of the orbit, R = 6 * GM/c^2.\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nR = 6 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (10 * 1.989 x 10^30) / (2.998 x 10^8)^2\nR ≈ 1.77 x 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the orbital frequency, f:\n\nf = (1/2π) * √((6.674 x 10^-11) * (10 * 1.989 x 10^30) / (1.77 x 10^7)^3)\nf ≈ 219 Hz\n\nNow, let's estimate the rate of energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, dE/dt. This can be approximated using the following formula:\n\ndE/dt ≈ (32/5) * (G^4/c^5) * (M^2 * m * (M+m) / R^5)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the accreting matter, which is 0.1 solar masses per year = 0.1 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg/year.\n\ndE/dt ≈ (32/5) * (6.674 x 10^-11)^4 * ((10 * 1.989 x 10^30)^2 * (0.1 * 1.989 x 10^30) * (10.1 * 1.989 x 10^30) / (1.77 x 10^7)^5) / (2.998 x 10^8)^5\ndE/dt ≈ 3.67 x 10^41 W\n\nNow, we can estimate the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave, h, assuming a distance r from the source:\n\nh ~ (6.674 x 10^-11 / (2.998 x 10^8)^4) * (3.67 x 10^41) / r\n\nThe amplitude h depends on the distance r from the source, so it cannot be determined without specifying the distance.\n\nIn summary, the maximum frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the black hole accretion disk is approximately 219 Hz, and the maximum amplitude depends on the distance from the source."
