    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy of cosmic rays, their penetration depth into human tissue, and the potential for resulting health effects can be quite complex. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. When they interact with Earth's atmosphere, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and other charged particles, which can penetrate the Earth's surface and even reach ground level.\n\nThe energy of cosmic rays plays a significant role in determining their penetration depth into human tissue. Higher-energy cosmic rays can penetrate deeper into the tissue, while lower-energy cosmic rays may not penetrate as far. The energy loss of these particles in the tissue depends on their charge, mass, and energy, as well as the density and composition of the tissue.\n\nThe potential health effects of cosmic rays depend on several factors, including the dose, duration of exposure, and the type of particles involved. The primary concern with cosmic ray exposure is the ionization of atoms and molecules in the human body, which can lead to the production of free radicals and damage to cellular structures, such as DNA. This damage can potentially lead to an increased risk of cancer, particularly for long-duration space travelers who are exposed to higher levels of cosmic rays outside of Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the energy of cosmic rays, their penetration depth into human tissue, and the potential for resulting health effects is complex and depends on multiple factors. Higher-energy cosmic rays can penetrate deeper into human tissue, potentially causing more damage to cellular structures and increasing the risk of health effects such as cancer. The overall risk depends on the dose, duration of exposure, and the type of particles involved."
