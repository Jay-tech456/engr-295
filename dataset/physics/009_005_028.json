    "message_2": "To determine the position and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the distance of the object from the mirror, and v is the distance of the image from the mirror.\n\nGiven:\nf = -10 cm (focal length is negative for concave mirrors)\nu = -20 cm (object distance is negative for real objects)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-10) - 1/(-20)\n1/v = (-1 + 2)/20\n1/v = 1/20\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSince the value of v is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a real image. Now, let's determine the nature of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nm = -20 / -20\nm = 1\n\nSince the magnification is 1, the image is the same size as the object. Also, since the magnification is positive, the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real, inverted image, located 20 cm away from the mirror on the principal axis, and it is the same size as the object."
