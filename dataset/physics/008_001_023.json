    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, and it is associated with the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving mass to other particles. The mass of the Higgs boson is approximately 125.1 GeV/cÂ² (gigaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared), which is equivalent to about 2.24 x 10^-25 kg.\n\nThe Higgs boson interacts with other fundamental particles in the Standard Model through the Higgs field. The Higgs field is a scalar field that permeates all of space, and it has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. When other particles, such as quarks, leptons, and the W and Z bosons, interact with the Higgs field, they acquire mass. The strength of the interaction between the Higgs field and a particle determines the mass of that particle. In other words, the more strongly a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more massive it is.\n\nIt is important to note that not all particles in the Standard Model acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. Photons and gluons, for example, remain massless because they do not interact with the Higgs field.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and its role in giving mass to other particles. This discovery was a major milestone in our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that make up the universe."
