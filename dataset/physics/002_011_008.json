    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the adiabatic process equation and the work done equation for an adiabatic process. \n\nFor an adiabatic process, the equation is:\nPV^γ = constant\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index or the ratio of specific heat capacities (Cp/Cv). For diatomic gases like air, γ is approximately 1.4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the constant in the adiabatic process equation using the initial conditions:\nP1 = 1.5 x 10^5 Pa (initial pressure)\nV1 = 0.05 m^3 (initial volume)\n\n(1.5 x 10^5 Pa)(0.05 m^3)^1.4 = constant\n\nNow, we need to find the final pressure (P2) when the volume is compressed to 0.01 m^3 (V2).\n\nconstant = P2(0.01 m^3)^1.4\nP2 = constant / (0.01 m^3)^1.4\n\nNext, we will find the work done on the gas during the adiabatic process. The work done (W) in an adiabatic process is given by:\n\nW = (P1V1 - P2V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nW = [(1.5 x 10^5 Pa)(0.05 m^3) - P2(0.01 m^3)] / (1.4 - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find P2 from the constant we found earlier:\n\nP2 = (1.5 x 10^5 Pa)(0.05 m^3)^1.4 / (0.01 m^3)^1.4\n\nCalculating P2:\n\nP2 ≈ 1.097 x 10^6 Pa\n\nNow, we can find the work done:\n\nW = [(1.5 x 10^5 Pa)(0.05 m^3) - (1.097 x 10^6 Pa)(0.01 m^3)] / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ (7500 J - 10970 J) / 0.4\nW ≈ -3470 J / 0.4\nW ≈ -8675 J\n\nThe work done on the gas during the adiabatic compression process is approximately -8675 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done on the gas (compressing it) rather than by the gas (expanding)."
