    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the square loop, we can simplify the calculation by considering only one side of the loop and then multiplying the result by 4.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop of side length 0.1 m, we can consider one side and divide it into small segments dl. Let's consider a segment at a distance x from the center of the side. The position vector r from the segment to point P has a magnitude of:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + 0.2²)\n\nThe angle θ between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(θ) = dl * r\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * dl * r) / r³\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 2π) * (dl / r²)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B due to one side of the loop, we need to integrate dB over the entire side length from -0.05 m to 0.05 m:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 2π) * (dl / r²) from -0.05 to 0.05\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field B at point P is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nNow we can perform the integration:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 2π) * ∫(dl / (x² + 0.2²)) from -0.05 to 0.05\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution: let u = x / 0.2, then du = dx / 0.2 and the limits of integration become -0.25 to 0.25:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 2π) * (1 / 0.2²) * ∫(du / (u² + 1)) from -0.25 to 0.25\n\nThis integral is of the form ∫(du / (u² + 1)) which is equal to arctan(u). So:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 2π) * (1 / 0.2²) * [arctan(0.25) - arctan(-0.25)]\n\nB_side = (4π × 10⁻⁷ / 2π) * (1 / 0.04) * 2 * arctan(0.25)\n\nB_side ≈ 10⁻⁶ * 50 * 0.245\n\nB_side ≈ 1.225 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nNow we can find the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total ≈ 4 * 1.225 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nB_total ≈ 4.9 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at point P located 0.2 m above the center of the square loop is approximately 4.9 × 10⁻⁴ T."
