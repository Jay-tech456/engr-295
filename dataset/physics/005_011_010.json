    "message_1": "A spaceship travels through space at a velocity of 0.8c. If its rest mass is 5000 kg, what is its relativistic mass as seen by an observer on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nm_rel = m_rest / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_rest is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the rest mass (m_rest) of 5000 kg and the velocity (v) of 0.8c, we can plug in the values and solve for the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = 5000 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nm_rel = 5000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm_rel = 5000 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm_rel = 5000 kg / 0.6\n\nm_rel â‰ˆ 8333.33 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship as seen by an observer on Earth is approximately 8333.33 kg."
