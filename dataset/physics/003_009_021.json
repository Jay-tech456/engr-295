    "message_1": "A sphere of radius 5 cm carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the center of the sphere? Assume the current flows uniformly throughout the volume of the sphere.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere, we need to integrate the magnetic field contribution from each small current element within the sphere. Let's consider a small volume element dV at a distance r' from the center of the sphere. The current density J can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / V\n\nwhere V is the volume of the sphere, given by (4/3)πR^3, with R = 5 cm.\n\nJ = 2 A / [(4/3)π(5 cm)^3] = 2 A / [(4/3)π(125 cm^3)] ≈ 0.0304 A/cm³\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element within the volume element dV:\n\ndI = J * dV\n\nThe magnetic field dB at a point P located 10 cm away from the center of the sphere due to this small current element can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the sphere, the magnetic field contributions from the current elements on opposite sides of the sphere will cancel each other out. Therefore, the net magnetic field at point P will be zero.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the center of the sphere is 0 T, and there is no specific direction since the magnetic field is zero."
