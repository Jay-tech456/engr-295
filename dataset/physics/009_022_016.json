    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that the polarizing angle (also known as the Brewster angle) occurs when the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction are such that the reflected light is completely polarized parallel to the surface. The law is given by the formula:\n\ntan(θ_p) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere θ_p is the polarizing angle, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (air in this case), and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass in this case).\n\nWe are given the angle of incidence (60 degrees) but not the refractive indices of air and glass. However, we can assume that the refractive index of air is approximately 1, and the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the polarizing angle:\n\ntan(θ_p) = 1.5 / 1\nθ_p = arctan(1.5)\n\nθ_p ≈ 56.3 degrees\n\nSo, the polarizing angle of the glass surface is approximately 56.3 degrees."
