    "message_2": "In quantum teleportation, the goal is to transfer the quantum state of a particle (in this case, a photon) to another particle without physically transmitting the particle itself. The protocol involves entanglement, Bell state measurements, and classical communication.\n\nWhen the initial state of the photon is in a superposition of horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization, the state can be represented as:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|H⟩ + β|V⟩\n\nwhere α and β are complex coefficients such that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.\n\nIn the quantum teleportation protocol, Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of photons in the Bell state:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|H⟩_A|H⟩_B + |V⟩_A|V⟩_B)\n\nAlice then performs a Bell state measurement on her photon and the photon to be teleported. This measurement projects the three-photon state onto one of the four Bell states. Depending on the outcome of this measurement, Bob's photon will be in one of four possible states:\n\n1. |Φ+⟩: Bob's photon is in the state α|H⟩ + β|V⟩ (the desired state).\n2. |Φ-⟩: Bob's photon is in the state α|H⟩ - β|V⟩.\n3. |Ψ+⟩: Bob's photon is in the state α|V⟩ + β|H⟩.\n4. |Ψ-⟩: Bob's photon is in the state α|V⟩ - β|H⟩.\n\nAlice then communicates the result of her measurement to Bob using classical communication (e.g., a phone call). Based on this information, Bob can perform the necessary operations on his photon to transform it into the desired state.\n\nSince there are four possible outcomes of Alice's Bell state measurement, each with equal probability, the probability of successfully teleporting the quantum state of the photon without any further operations is 1/4 or 25%. However, after receiving Alice's measurement result and performing the appropriate operations, Bob can always obtain the desired state with 100% probability."
