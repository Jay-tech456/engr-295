    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, alpha particles are scattered by the positively charged nucleus of an atom. The distance of closest approach, also known as the impact parameter (b), is the minimum distance between the alpha particle and the nucleus during the scattering process.\n\nThe scattering angle (θ) is the angle between the initial trajectory of the alpha particle and its trajectory after being scattered by the nucleus. The relationship between the distance of closest approach and the scattering angle can be derived from the conservation of energy and angular momentum principles.\n\nAccording to Rutherford's scattering formula, the scattering angle (θ) is related to the impact parameter (b) as follows:\n\nθ = 2 * arctan(Z * e^2 / (2 * π * ε₀ * b * E))\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number of the target nucleus, e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, and E is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the scattering angle (θ) is inversely proportional to the distance of closest approach (b). Therefore, if the distance of closest approach (b) decreases, the scattering angle (θ) will increase, and vice versa.\n\nIn summary, changing the distance of closest approach in the Rutherford scattering experiment will have a significant effect on the scattering angle. A smaller distance of closest approach will result in a larger scattering angle, while a larger distance of closest approach will result in a smaller scattering angle."
