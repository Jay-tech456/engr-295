    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state of hydrogen and deuterium atoms, we can use the formula for the spontaneous emission rate, which is given by:\n\nA = (2 * pi * e^2 * f^2 * (E2 - E1)) / (3 * epsilon_0 * hbar * c^3)\n\nwhere A is the spontaneous emission rate, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), f is the oscillator strength (approximately 0.416 for hydrogen and deuterium), E2 and E1 are the energies of the excited state and ground state respectively, epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 x 10^-12 F/m), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (1.05 x 10^-34 Js), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe lifetime (tau) of the excited state is the inverse of the spontaneous emission rate:\n\ntau = 1 / A\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state for hydrogen and deuterium:\n\nFor hydrogen, E2 - E1 = 10.2 eV = 10.2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = 1.632 x 10^-18 J\nFor deuterium, E2 - E1 = 9.3 eV = 9.3 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = 1.488 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the spontaneous emission rate for hydrogen and deuterium:\n\nFor hydrogen:\nA_H = (2 * pi * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * 0.416 * (1.632 x 10^-18 J)) / (3 * (8.85 x 10^-12 F/m) * (1.05 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3)\nA_H ≈ 6.54 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nFor deuterium:\nA_D = (2 * pi * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * 0.416 * (1.488 x 10^-18 J)) / (3 * (8.85 x 10^-12 F/m) * (1.05 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3)\nA_D ≈ 5.97 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the lifetime of the excited state for hydrogen and deuterium:\n\nFor hydrogen:\ntau_H = 1 / A_H ≈ 1 / (6.54 x 10^6 s^-1) ≈ 1.53 x 10^-7 s\n\nFor deuterium:\ntau_D = 1 / A_D ≈ 1 / (5.97 x 10^6 s^-1) ≈ 1.67 x 10^-7 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state of hydrogen atom (n=2) is approximately 1.53 x 10^-7 seconds, and the lifetime of the first excited state of deuterium atom (n=2) is approximately 1.67 x 10^-7 seconds."
