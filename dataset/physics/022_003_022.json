    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy is not uniform but rather forms a roughly spherical halo around the galaxy. This halo extends well beyond the visible stars and gas, and its density decreases with increasing distance from the galactic center. The exact shape and distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way are still being studied and refined, but it is generally accepted that the dark matter halo is more extended and less concentrated than the visible matter.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in the rotation of the galaxy's outer edges. According to the classical Newtonian theory of gravity, the rotation curve of a galaxy (i.e., the relationship between the rotational velocity of stars and their distance from the galactic center) should decrease as we move away from the center, following the distribution of visible matter. However, observations of the Milky Way and other galaxies show that the rotation curves remain flat or even slightly increase at large distances from the center.\n\nThis discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter alone is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter. The presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy provides additional gravitational force, which keeps the outer stars and gas rotating at higher velocities than would be expected if only visible matter were present. This effect is known as the \"dark matter problem\" or the \"missing mass problem\" in galaxy dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy forms a halo around the galaxy, and its presence helps to explain the observed flat rotation curves of the galaxy's outer edges, which cannot be accounted for by visible matter alone."
