    "message_2": "Charm and bottom quarks are heavier quarks that participate in weak interactions, which cause them to decay into lighter quarks. Their decay modes are determined by their properties, such as their mass, charge, and weak isospin. The primary decay modes for charm and bottom quarks are as follows:\n\n1. Charm quark (c) decay modes:\nThe charm quark has a charge of +2/3 e and a mass of about 1.3 GeV/c². It primarily decays through the weak interaction via the exchange of a W boson. The main decay modes for charm quarks are:\n\na) c → s + W+ (W+ then decays into lighter quarks or leptons)\nb) c → d + W+ (W+ then decays into lighter quarks or leptons)\n\nIn both cases, the charm quark decays into a strange or down quark, accompanied by the emission of a W+ boson. The W+ boson subsequently decays into either a pair of lighter quarks or a lepton and its corresponding neutrino.\n\n2. Bottom quark (b) decay modes:\nThe bottom quark has a charge of -1/3 e and a mass of about 4.2 GeV/c². Like the charm quark, it also decays through the weak interaction via the exchange of a W boson. The main decay modes for bottom quarks are:\n\na) b → c + W- (W- then decays into lighter quarks or leptons)\nb) b → u + W- (W- then decays into lighter quarks or leptons)\nc) b → s + γ (radiative decay, less common)\n\nIn the first two cases, the bottom quark decays into a charm or up quark, accompanied by the emission of a W- boson. The W- boson subsequently decays into either a pair of lighter quarks or a lepton and its corresponding antineutrino. In the third case, the bottom quark decays into a strange quark through the emission of a photon (γ). This radiative decay is less common compared to the other two modes.\n\nThe properties of charm and bottom quarks, such as their mass and weak isospin, determine the possible decay modes by conserving charge, energy, and other quantum numbers. The heavier mass of these quarks allows them to decay into lighter quarks through the weak interaction, which is mediated by the exchange of W and Z bosons."
