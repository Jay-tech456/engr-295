    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the temperature of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. We can rearrange this equation to solve for T:\n\nT = PV / (nR)\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (P = 2 atm), the initial volume (Vi = 5 L), and the number of moles (n = 0.2 moles). We also know that the ideal gas constant R = 0.0821 L atm / (K mol). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nT = (2 atm * 5 L) / (0.2 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol))\nT ≈ 609.74 K\n\nNow that we have the temperature, we can calculate the work done during the isothermal expansion:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\nW = 0.2 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 609.74 K * ln(10 L / 5 L)\n\nW ≈ 1.64 J/mol * K * 609.74 K * ln(2)\nW ≈ 1000.97 J * ln(2)\nW ≈ 693.15 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 693.15 J."
