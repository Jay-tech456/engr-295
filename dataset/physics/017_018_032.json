    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy levels of an electron confined in a spherical quantum well, also known as a spherical potential well or a spherical box. The energy levels for an electron in a spherical quantum well can be found using the following formula:\n\nE_(n,l) = (h^2 / 8π^2m) * (n^2 / R^2) + V_0\n\nwhere E_(n,l) is the energy of the electron in the nth radial quantum number and the lth angular quantum number, h is the reduced Planck's constant (h = 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js / 2π), m is the mass of the electron (m = 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg), n is the radial quantum number, R is the radius of the quantum well, and V_0 is the depth of the quantum well.\n\nFor the ground state, n = 1 and l = 0. For the first excited state, n = 2 and l = 0. We can plug these values into the formula to find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n = 1, l = 0) with a quantum well depth of 5 eV:\n\nE_(1,0) = (h^2 / 8π^2m) * (1^2 / (10 x 10^(-9))^2) + 5 eV\n\nNext, let's find the energy of the first excited state (n = 2, l = 0) with a quantum well depth of 5 eV:\n\nE_(2,0) = (h^2 / 8π^2m) * (2^2 / (10 x 10^(-9))^2) + 5 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state:\n\nΔE = E_(2,0) - E_(1,0)\n\nTo find the energy difference when the quantum well depth is increased to 10 eV, we can repeat the process with V_0 = 10 eV:\n\nE_(1,0) = (h^2 / 8π^2m) * (1^2 / (10 x 10^(-9))^2) + 10 eV\nE_(2,0) = (h^2 / 8π^2m) * (2^2 / (10 x 10^(-9))^2) + 10 eV\n\nΔE' = E_(2,0) - E_(1,0)\n\nCalculate the energy differences ΔE and ΔE' to find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state for both quantum well depths."
