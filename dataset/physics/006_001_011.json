    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required for an electron to transition from n=2 to n=4 energy level in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and eV (electron volt) is the unit of energy.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the electron in the initial state (n=2):\n\nE_initial = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy of the electron in the final state (n=4):\n\nE_final = -13.6 eV / (4^2) = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow we can find the energy difference:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nSo, the energy required for an electron to transition from the n=2 to n=4 energy level in a hydrogen atom is 2.55 eV."
