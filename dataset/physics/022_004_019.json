    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the structure and evolution of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe and plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\n1. Gravitational effects: Dark matter is thought to provide the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies. It helps to bind the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) in galaxies together and influences the overall structure and distribution of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way. The gravitational pull of dark matter also affects the orbits of satellite galaxies, causing them to move in specific patterns that can be observed and measured.\n\n2. Galaxy formation and evolution: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies by providing the necessary gravitational force to collapse gas clouds and initiate star formation. The presence of dark matter in satellite galaxies also affects their evolution, as it influences the rate of star formation, the distribution of stars and gas, and the overall morphology of the galaxies.\n\n3. Tidal interactions: The gravitational interaction between the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies can lead to tidal stripping, where stars and gas are pulled away from the satellite galaxies and added to the Milky Way's halo. The presence of dark matter in satellite galaxies can affect the efficiency of this process, as it can help to resist the tidal forces and maintain the structural integrity of the satellite galaxies.\n\nObservations and experimental evidence supporting the existence of dark matter in satellite galaxies include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of satellite galaxies show that their outer regions rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to keep the outer stars in orbit.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The gravitational effects of dark matter can bend and distort the light from distant background galaxies, creating a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Observations of strong gravitational lensing in satellite galaxies provide indirect evidence for the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Velocity dispersion: The distribution of velocities of stars in satellite galaxies can provide information about the mass distribution within the galaxies. Observations of high velocity dispersions in satellite galaxies suggest the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, which can be attributed to dark matter.\n\n4. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides information about the early universe. Observations of the CMB radiation show a pattern of temperature fluctuations that can be explained by the presence of dark matter in the early universe, which would have influenced the formation of satellite galaxies.\n\n5. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies on large scales in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides the gravitational force necessary to form galaxy clusters and filaments. Satellite galaxies are part of this large-scale structure, and their distribution and properties can be used as evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter affects the structure and evolution of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way by providing the necessary gravitational force to bind visible matter together and influence the overall morphology and distribution of these galaxies. Observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, velocity dispersion, CMB radiation, and large-scale structure provide experimental evidence supporting the existence of dark matter in satellite galaxies."
