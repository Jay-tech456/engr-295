    "message_2": "Axions and magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that have been proposed to explain certain phenomena in particle physics and cosmology. While there is no direct experimental evidence for their existence, there are several indirect observations and theoretical motivations that suggest their possible existence.\n\nAxions:\n\nAxions are hypothetical particles that were first proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are also considered as a possible candidate for dark matter, which makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe.\n\nExperimental evidence for axions is indirect and comes from several sources:\n\n1. The strong CP problem: The QCD Lagrangian should contain a term that violates CP symmetry, but experimental observations show that the strong interactions conserve CP symmetry to a high degree. The Peccei-Quinn mechanism, which introduces axions, provides a natural explanation for this conservation.\n\n2. Dark matter: Axions are a candidate for cold dark matter, which is needed to explain the observed large-scale structure of the universe. Several experiments, such as ADMX, CAST, and IAXO, are searching for axions through their expected interactions with photons in the presence of strong magnetic fields.\n\nCurrent parameters for axions:\n\nThe mass of axions is not well-constrained, but it is expected to be very light, in the range of 10^(-6) to 10^(-3) eV. The interaction strength of axions with other particles is also very weak, making them difficult to detect.\n\nMagnetic Monopoles:\n\nMagnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that possess a single magnetic charge, either north or south. They were first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1931 and are predicted by many grand unified theories (GUTs) and some string theories.\n\nExperimental evidence for magnetic monopoles is also indirect and comes from several sources:\n\n1. Theoretical motivation: Many GUTs and string theories predict the existence of magnetic monopoles as a natural consequence of their symmetry-breaking mechanisms.\n\n2. Cosmic rays: Some experiments have searched for magnetic monopoles in cosmic rays, but no conclusive evidence has been found. The MACRO experiment at Gran Sasso and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole are examples of such experiments.\n\n3. Monopole catalysis of proton decay: Some theories predict that magnetic monopoles can catalyze proton decay, which would provide indirect evidence for their existence. However, no such decay has been observed in experiments like Super-Kamiokande.\n\nCurrent parameters for magnetic monopoles:\n\nThe mass of magnetic monopoles is expected to be very large, typically around the GUT scale, which is around 10^(16) GeV. Their interaction strength is determined by their magnetic charge, which is quantized in units of the Dirac magnetic charge.\n\nIn summary, while there is no direct experimental evidence for the existence of axions and magnetic monopoles, there are several indirect observations and theoretical motivations that suggest their possible existence. Current experimental efforts are focused on searching for these particles and constraining their properties."
