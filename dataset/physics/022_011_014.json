    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects the observed gravitational lensing of a distant object behind a galaxy cluster by increasing the overall mass of the cluster, which in turn enhances the lensing effect. Gravitational lensing occurs when the mass of an object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light coming from a more distant object, like a galaxy or quasar. This bending of light causes the distant object to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it undetectable through direct observation. However, it does interact gravitationally, and its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light. In a galaxy cluster, both normal (baryonic) matter and dark matter contribute to the overall mass, and thus the gravitational lensing effect.\n\nTo distinguish the effects of dark matter from normal matter in the cluster, astronomers use a combination of observations and modeling techniques:\n\n1. Mass distribution: By studying the distribution of visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) in the galaxy cluster, astronomers can estimate the mass distribution of normal matter. This can be done using observations in various wavelengths, such as optical, X-ray, and radio.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing models: Astronomers use the observed gravitational lensing effects (distortions, magnifications, etc.) to create models of the mass distribution in the galaxy cluster. These models take into account both the visible matter and the unseen dark matter.\n\n3. Comparison and subtraction: By comparing the mass distribution models of the visible matter with the gravitational lensing models, astronomers can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in the galaxy cluster. The difference between the two models indicates the contribution of dark matter to the overall mass and lensing effect.\n\n4. Dynamical studies: Another way to distinguish the effects of dark matter is by studying the motions of galaxies within the cluster. The velocities of galaxies are influenced by the gravitational pull of both normal and dark matter. By analyzing these velocities, astronomers can estimate the total mass of the cluster and the contribution of dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter enhances the observed gravitational lensing of a distant object behind a galaxy cluster. To distinguish the effects of dark matter from normal matter, astronomers use a combination of observations, modeling techniques, and dynamical studies to infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in the cluster."
