    "message_1": "A 20 cm long wire carrying a current of 2 A is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.5 T. What is the magnitude and direction of the force experienced by the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the force experienced by the wire, we can use the formula:\n\nF = B * I * L * sin(theta)\n\nwhere F is the force, B is the magnetic field strength, I is the current, L is the length of the wire, and theta is the angle between the magnetic field and the current.\n\nIn this case, B = 0.5 T, I = 2 A, L = 0.2 m (converted from 20 cm), and since the wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field, theta = 90 degrees. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nF = B * I * L\n\nF = (0.5 T) * (2 A) * (0.2 m)\n\nF = 0.2 N\n\nThe magnitude of the force experienced by the wire is 0.2 N.\n\nTo find the direction of the force, we can use the right-hand rule. Point your thumb in the direction of the current, and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. Your palm will then point in the direction of the force. Since the wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force will be perpendicular to both the wire and the magnetic field."
