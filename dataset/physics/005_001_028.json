    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an observer measures the time interval of an event happening in a moving frame of reference. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time interval measured by the moving clock (the proper time), Δt is the time interval measured by the observer (the dilated time), v is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving clock, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the relative velocity is 0.8c, and the observer measures a time interval of 10 seconds. We need to find the time duration as measured by the moving clock (Δt').\n\nPlugging in the given values into the equation:\n\nΔt' = 10 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = 10 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt' = 10 / sqrt(0.36)\n\nΔt' = 10 / 0.6\n\nΔt' ≈ 16.67 seconds\n\nSo, the time duration as measured by the moving clock is approximately 16.67 seconds."
