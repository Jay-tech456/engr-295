    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a cosmic string network, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency of gravitational waves (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_osc, where f_osc is the oscillation frequency of the cosmic string.\n\n2. Amplitude of gravitational waves (h): h = G * μ / (r * c^2), where G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), μ is the linear mass density of the cosmic string, r is the distance from the cosmic string, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of gravitational waves (f_GW):\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_osc = 2 * 200 Hz = 400 Hz\n\nNow, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the cosmic string. We can use the formula:\n\nμ = T / c^2, where T is the tension of the cosmic string.\n\nμ = (10^17 N) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 1.112 × 10^6 kg/m\n\nFinally, let's find the amplitude of gravitational waves (h). We need to know the distance (r) from the cosmic string. Since it's not given, we'll assume a distance of 1 light-year (9.461 × 10^15 m) for this calculation:\n\nh = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.112 × 10^6 kg/m) / ((9.461 × 10^15 m) * (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2) ≈ 2.49 × 10^-29\n\nSo, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the cosmic string network is 400 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 2.49 × 10^-29 (assuming a distance of 1 light-year). Keep in mind that the amplitude value will change if the distance from the cosmic string is different."
