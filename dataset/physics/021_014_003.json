    "message_2": "Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are extremely bright and distant celestial objects that emit massive amounts of energy in the form of radiation. The physical mechanism that causes quasars to emit such intense radiation is closely related to the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.\n\nThe supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy has a mass that is millions to billions of times greater than that of our Sun. As the black hole's immense gravitational force attracts surrounding gas, dust, and other matter, this material forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The accretion disk is a rotating, flattened structure where the matter spirals inward towards the black hole.\n\nAs the matter in the accretion disk gets closer to the black hole, it becomes compressed and heated due to the intense gravitational forces and friction between particles. This heating causes the matter to emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The radiation emitted by the accretion disk is what makes quasars so incredibly bright.\n\nIn addition to the radiation emitted by the accretion disk, powerful jets of charged particles can be ejected from the vicinity of the black hole. These jets, moving at nearly the speed of light, can also emit radiation as they interact with the surrounding interstellar medium. This further contributes to the extreme brightness of quasars.\n\nIn summary, the physical mechanism that causes quasars to emit extremely bright radiation is the process of accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. The intense gravitational forces and friction within the accretion disk heat the matter, causing it to emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The presence of a supermassive black hole is essential for the formation of quasars and their intense radiation output."
