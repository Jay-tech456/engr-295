    "message_2": "The energizing mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova remnants is primarily based on the theory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). This process occurs when a supernova explosion generates a shock wave that propagates through the interstellar medium (ISM). As the shock wave moves, it compresses and heats the surrounding gas, creating a region of high pressure and temperature behind the shock front. This region is known as the supernova remnant.\n\nIn the DSA process, charged particles (mainly protons and electrons) are accelerated by repeatedly crossing the shock front. When a charged particle approaches the shock front, it experiences an electric field due to the motion of the plasma in the shock. This electric field accelerates the particle, increasing its energy. The particle then moves into the downstream region (behind the shock front) and scatters off magnetic field irregularities, which causes it to change direction. If the particle is scattered back towards the shock front, it can be accelerated again, gaining even more energy. This process can continue multiple times, leading to a significant increase in the particle's energy.\n\nThe acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova remnants is an essential process in the overall energy budget of the Milky Way Galaxy. Supernova explosions release a tremendous amount of energy, with a significant fraction of this energy being transferred to cosmic rays through the DSA process. These cosmic rays then propagate throughout the galaxy, carrying their energy with them. When cosmic rays interact with the ISM, they can transfer their energy to the gas, heating it and contributing to the overall energy budget of the galaxy.\n\nSeveral lines of observational evidence support the idea that supernova remnants are the primary sources of cosmic rays in our galaxy. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from the observation of high-energy gamma rays from supernova remnants. These gamma rays are produced when cosmic rays accelerated in the supernova remnant interact with the surrounding gas, creating neutral pions that decay into gamma rays. The detection of these gamma rays provides a direct link between supernova remnants and the acceleration of cosmic rays.\n\nAdditionally, the observed energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the galaxy matches well with the predictions of the DSA theory. The energy spectrum of cosmic rays follows a power-law distribution, which is consistent with the acceleration process in supernova remnants. Furthermore, the total energy contained in cosmic rays in the galaxy is roughly consistent with the energy that would be expected from the rate of supernova explosions and the efficiency of the DSA process.\n\nIn summary, the current understanding of the energizing mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova remnants is based on the diffusive shock acceleration process. This process plays a crucial role in the overall energy budget of the Milky Way Galaxy, as it transfers a significant fraction of the energy released in supernova explosions to cosmic rays. Observational evidence, such as the detection of high-energy gamma rays from supernova remnants and the consistency of the cosmic ray energy spectrum with DSA predictions, supports this understanding."
