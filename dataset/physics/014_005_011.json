    "message_2": "The distribution of matter in the universe on large scales is characterized by a cosmic web-like structure, consisting of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. This structure is a result of the gravitational interaction of dark matter, baryonic matter (ordinary matter), and dark energy.\n\n1. Galaxy clusters: These are the most massive and dense regions in the cosmic web, where numerous galaxies are gravitationally bound together. They are primarily composed of dark matter, with baryonic matter making up a smaller fraction in the form of galaxies, gas, and dust.\n\n2. Filaments: These are the \"bridges\" connecting galaxy clusters, consisting of dark matter and baryonic matter. They are elongated structures that can stretch for tens or even hundreds of millions of light-years.\n\n3. Voids: These are the underdense regions in the cosmic web, with very few galaxies and a lower concentration of dark matter. Voids can be tens to hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter.\n\nThe distribution of matter in the universe plays a crucial role in the evolution of cosmic structures. In the early universe, small fluctuations in the density of matter led to the formation of the cosmic web. Regions with higher density attracted more matter due to gravity, while regions with lower density lost matter. This process, known as gravitational instability, caused the growth of structures over time.\n\nDark matter, which makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe, plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. Its gravitational influence drives the formation of galaxy clusters and filaments, providing the \"scaffolding\" for the cosmic web. Baryonic matter, such as gas and dust, follows the distribution of dark matter and forms galaxies within these structures.\n\nDark energy, which makes up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe, has a repulsive effect on the expansion of the universe. It counteracts the attractive force of gravity and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. This acceleration affects the growth of cosmic structures by limiting the amount of matter that can be gravitationally pulled into galaxy clusters and filaments. As a result, the evolution of cosmic structures is influenced by the interplay between dark matter, baryonic matter, and dark energy.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of matter in the universe on large scales is characterized by a cosmic web of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. The evolution of these structures is driven by the gravitational interaction of dark matter, baryonic matter, and dark energy, with dark matter providing the scaffolding for the cosmic web and dark energy influencing the growth of structures by affecting the expansion of the universe."
