    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the sheet, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to an infinite current-carrying sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the sheet.\n\nHowever, our sheet is not infinite, so we need to use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field due to a finite sheet. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r^3\n\nwhere r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nWe can break the sheet into small current-carrying elements along the longer side (20 cm) and integrate the magnetic field contributions from each element. Let's consider a small current element at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the longer side. The current in this small element is given by:\n\ndI = (I / L) * dx\n\nwhere L is the length of the longer side (20 cm) and dx is the width of the small current element.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated is given by:\n\nr = (x, d)\n\nNow we can find the magnetic field dB due to this small current element:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dx × r) / r^3\n\nSince the current flows parallel to the longer side of the sheet, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the sheet. Therefore, we only need to consider the vertical component of the magnetic field. Integrating the magnetic field contributions from all the current elements along the longer side, we get:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dx × r) / r^3\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * L) * ∫(dx × r) / r^3, where the integration is from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nLet's calculate the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * L) * ∫(dx × r) / r^3\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * L) * ∫(dx × (x, d)) / ((x^2 + d^2)^(3/2)), where the integration is from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nThis integral can be solved using a standard table of integrals or a computer algebra system. The result is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * L) * (2 * arctan(L / (2 * d)) / (d * sqrt(d^2 + (L/2)^2)))\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4π * 0.2 m) * (2 * arctan(0.2 m / (2 * 0.04 m)) / (0.04 m * sqrt(0.04^2 + (0.2/2)^2)))\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the sheet is approximately 2.5 μT."
