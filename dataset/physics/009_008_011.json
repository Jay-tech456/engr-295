    "message_2": "As a text-based AI, I cannot draw a ray diagram for you, but I can help you understand how to draw one yourself and find the position, size, and nature of the image formed.\n\nTo draw a ray diagram for a concave lens, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis of the lens.\n2. Draw a vertical line in the middle of the principal axis to represent the lens.\n3. Mark the focal point (F) on both sides of the lens at a distance of 20 cm (since the focal length is -20 cm, which means it's a diverging lens).\n4. Place the object (represented by an arrow) on the left side of the lens at a distance of 50 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, draw the rays:\n\n5. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object towards the lens. Once it reaches the lens, draw a dotted line from the point where the ray hits the lens to the focal point on the left side of the lens. This represents the path the ray would have taken if it were not diverged by the lens.\n6. Draw a ray from the top of the object through the center of the lens. Since the lens is thin, this ray will continue in a straight line without changing its direction.\n\nTo find the position, size, and nature of the image:\n\n7. The two rays drawn in steps 5 and 6 will diverge and will not intersect on the right side of the lens. Extend these rays back on the left side of the lens until they intersect. This intersection point will give you the position of the image.\n8. Draw a vertical line (arrow) from the intersection point to the principal axis. This arrow represents the image.\n9. Measure the distance from the image to the lens. This is the image distance (v).\n10. Measure the height of the image and compare it to the height of the object. This will give you the size of the image.\n\nIn this case, you will find that the image is formed on the same side as the object, it is smaller in size, and it is upright. Since the image is formed on the same side as the object, it is a virtual image.\n\nTo calculate the image distance (v) and height (h') mathematically, you can use the lens formula and magnification formula:\n\nLens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = h'/h = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length (-20 cm)\nu = object distance (-50 cm, negative since it's on the left side of the lens)\nv = image distance\nh = object height\nh' = image height\nM = magnification\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/(-50) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, you get:\n\nv = -33.33 cm\n\nNow, use the magnification formula to find the image height (h'):\n\nM = h'/h = -v/u\n\nAssuming the object height (h) is 10 cm, you can find the image height (h'):\n\nh' = M * h = (-(-33.33)/(-50)) * 10 = (33.33/50) * 10 = 6.67 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 33.33 cm on the same side as the object, it is 6.67 cm tall, and it is upright and virtual."
