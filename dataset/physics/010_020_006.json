    "message_1": "What is the viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid containing 0.05 kg/s of suspended particles with a radius of 0.1 mm, when it is subjected to a shear stress of 100 N/m^2?",
    "message_2": "To determine the viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid, we need to know its flow behavior or rheological model. Non-Newtonian fluids can exhibit various flow behaviors, such as shear-thinning (pseudoplastic), shear-thickening (dilatant), or viscoelastic (Bingham plastic, thixotropic, etc.) properties.\n\nHowever, since we don't have enough information about the specific flow behavior of the fluid in question, we cannot provide a direct answer to the viscosity of this non-Newtonian fluid.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the fluid's rheological properties or flow behavior, we can help you determine its viscosity under the given conditions."
