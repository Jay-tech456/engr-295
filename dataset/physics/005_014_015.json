What is the kinetic energy of the parent particle before it decayed? (Hint: use the formula E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2, where E is energy, m is mass, p is momentum, and c is the speed of light)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the relativistic mass (m') of the parent particle using the formula:\n\nm' = m / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nm' = 5 GeV/c^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nm' = 5 GeV/c^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nm' = 5 GeV/c^2 / sqrt(0.64)\nm' ≈ 6.25 GeV/c^2\n\nNow, we can find the total energy (E) of the parent particle using the formula:\n\nE = m'c^2\nE ≈ 6.25 GeV\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy (K) of the parent particle. The kinetic energy is the difference between the total energy and the rest energy:\n\nK = E - mc^2\nK ≈ 6.25 GeV - 5 GeV\nK ≈ 1.25 GeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the parent particle before it decayed is approximately 1.25 GeV."
