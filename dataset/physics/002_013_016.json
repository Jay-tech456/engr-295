    "message_1": "A heat engine works between two heat reservoirs, one at a temperature of 600K and the other at 300K. Determine the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency that a heat engine can achieve when operating between two heat reservoirs at temperatures T1 (higher temperature) and T2 (lower temperature). The Carnot efficiency is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T2 / T1)\n\nIn this case, T1 = 600K and T2 = 300K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 / 600) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the engine is 50%."
