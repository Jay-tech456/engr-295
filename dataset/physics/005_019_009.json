    "message_1": "A particle accelerator is producing gamma rays with a frequency of 4.5 x 10^21 Hz. If these gamma rays are interfering with another beam of gamma rays with the same frequency but traveling in the opposite direction, what is the resulting frequency observed by an observer moving at a speed of 0.9c relative to the source?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for the frequency observed by a moving observer. The formula is:\n\nf_obs = f_src * ( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^(1/2)\n\nwhere f_obs is the observed frequency, f_src is the source frequency, v is the relative velocity of the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nf_src = 4.5 x 10^21 Hz\nv = 0.9c\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf_obs = (4.5 x 10^21 Hz) * ( (1 + 0.9) / (1 - 0.9) )^(1/2)\n\nf_obs = (4.5 x 10^21 Hz) * ( (1.9) / (0.1) )^(1/2)\n\nf_obs = (4.5 x 10^21 Hz) * (19)^(1/2)\n\nf_obs ≈ (4.5 x 10^21 Hz) * 4.3589\n\nf_obs ≈ 1.961 x 10^22 Hz\n\nThe resulting frequency observed by the moving observer is approximately 1.961 x 10^22 Hz."
