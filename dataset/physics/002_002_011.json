    "message_2": "To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water from 20°C to 80°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat required (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in kilograms), c is the specific heat capacity of the substance (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nm = 1 kg = 1000 g (since 1 kg = 1000 g)\nc = 4.18 J/g°C (specific heat of water)\nΔT = 80°C - 20°C = 60°C\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (1000 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (60°C)\n\nQ = 1000 × 4.18 × 60\n\nQ = 250800 J\n\nSo, 250,800 joules of heat are required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water from 20°C to 80°C."
