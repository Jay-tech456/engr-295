    "message_2": "The maximum mass of a star that can still avoid a gravitational collapse is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit is approximately 2-3 solar masses (Mâ˜‰) for neutron stars, which are the dense remnants of massive stars after a supernova explosion. The exact value of the TOV limit depends on the equation of state of the neutron star's matter, which is still an area of active research in astrophysics.\n\nThe reason behind the TOV limit is the balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward pressure provided by the degeneracy pressure of neutrons. In a neutron star, the neutrons are packed so closely together that they reach a state called neutron degeneracy, where they resist further compression due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions (particles with half-integer spins, like neutrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nWhen the mass of a neutron star exceeds the TOV limit, the gravitational force becomes too strong for the neutron degeneracy pressure to counteract. As a result, the star undergoes gravitational collapse, potentially forming a black hole if no other forces can halt the collapse."
