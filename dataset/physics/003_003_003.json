    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid, we can use Ampere's law and the Biot-Savart law. Ampere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field inside the toroid. The magnetic field inside a toroid is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and R is the mean radius of the toroid.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 500 turns * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 1000 A) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁴ Tm²) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 2 × 10⁻³ T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid located 5 cm from the center of the toroid. To do this, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field due to a small current element is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r³)\n\nwhere dB is the infinitesimal magnetic field, I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nSince the toroid is symmetrical, the magnetic field at a point on the axis will be the same for all current elements. Therefore, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire toroid to find the total magnetic field at the point:\n\nB_total = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r³)\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the toroid, the magnetic field at a point on the axis located 5 cm from the center of the toroid will be zero. This is because the magnetic field contributions from opposite sides of the toroid will cancel each other out.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid located 5 cm from the center of the toroid is 0 T."
