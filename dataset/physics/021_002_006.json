    "message_2": "The distance from the singularity to the event horizon for a black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFor a black hole of one solar mass, M = 1.989 x 10^30 kg (the mass of the Sun). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nR_s = (2 x 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nR_s â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the distance from the singularity to the event horizon for a black hole of one solar mass is approximately 2.95 x 10^3 meters, or 2.95 kilometers.\n\nThe properties of the event horizon are determined by the mass, charge, and angular momentum of the black hole. In this case, we are considering a non-rotating, uncharged black hole with a mass of one solar mass. The event horizon acts as a boundary beyond which no information or matter can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The size of the event horizon, as calculated by the Schwarzschild radius, determines the region of space from which escape is impossible. The larger the event horizon, the more space is encompassed by the black hole's gravitational influence.\n\nIn summary, the distance from the singularity to the event horizon for a black hole of one solar mass is approximately 2.95 kilometers, and this distance determines the size of the region from which no information or matter can escape the black hole's gravitational pull."
