    "message_2": "The mass of a black hole has a significant impact on its temperature and entropy, according to the laws of thermodynamics in high-energy physics. The relationship between these properties can be understood through the concept of black hole thermodynamics, which combines general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.\n\n1. Temperature: The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship is described by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. As the mass of a black hole increases, its temperature decreases. This means that larger black holes are colder than smaller ones.\n\n2. Entropy: The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon's surface area. This relationship is described by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:\n\nS = (kc³A) / (4ħG)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, A is the surface area of the event horizon, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant. The surface area of the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole by the formula:\n\nA = 16π(GM)² / c⁴\n\nAs the mass of a black hole increases, its event horizon's surface area also increases, leading to an increase in entropy. This means that larger black holes have higher entropy than smaller ones.\n\nIn summary, as the mass of a black hole increases, its temperature decreases, and its entropy increases. These relationships are derived from the laws of thermodynamics in high-energy physics and provide insights into the behavior of black holes and their interactions with the surrounding environment."
