    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They are different from black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars, which are the most common type of black holes we observe today.\n\nThe probability of a black hole with a mass of 10^12 kg being a primordial black hole depends on the abundance of PBHs in the universe and the mass distribution of PBHs. The exact abundance and mass distribution of PBHs are still uncertain, as they have not been directly observed yet.\n\nHowever, it is generally believed that the probability of a black hole with a mass of 10^12 kg being a primordial black hole is quite low. This is because the mass range of PBHs is expected to be much smaller than that of black holes formed by stellar collapse. Stellar black holes typically have masses between 3 and 100 solar masses (1 solar mass is approximately 2 x 10^30 kg), while the mass range of PBHs is thought to be between 10^15 kg and 10^36 kg.\n\nA black hole with a mass of 10^12 kg would be much smaller than the expected mass range for PBHs, making it unlikely to be a primordial black hole. However, it is important to note that our understanding of PBHs is still limited, and future observations and theoretical developments could change our understanding of their properties and abundance."
