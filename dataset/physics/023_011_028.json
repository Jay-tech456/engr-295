    "message_2": "The maximum number of qubits that can be used in a superconducting quantum computer while maintaining coherence and fault tolerance is not a fixed number. It depends on the specific technology and design of the quantum computer, as well as the progress in error correction techniques. As of now, state-of-the-art superconducting quantum computers have demonstrated up to a few dozen qubits with varying levels of coherence and fault tolerance.\n\nThe most common sources of errors in superconducting qubits are:\n\n1. Decoherence: This is the loss of quantum information due to interaction with the environment, which causes the qubits to lose their superposition states. Decoherence is a major challenge in maintaining the coherence of qubits.\n\n2. Control errors: These errors occur during the manipulation of qubits, such as during gate operations or qubit initialization. Imperfections in control pulses and inaccuracies in the applied microwave frequencies can lead to control errors.\n\n3. Crosstalk: This is the unwanted interaction between qubits, which can cause errors in the quantum computation. Crosstalk can be due to capacitive, inductive, or magnetic coupling between qubits.\n\n4. Leakage: Leakage occurs when a qubit transitions to an energy level outside the computational subspace, which can lead to errors in the quantum computation.\n\nTo mitigate these errors in practical applications, several techniques are employed:\n\n1. Error correction codes: Quantum error correction codes, such as the surface code or the toric code, are used to detect and correct errors in quantum computations. These codes require additional qubits, called ancilla qubits, to encode and protect the quantum information.\n\n2. Improving qubit designs: Researchers are constantly working on improving the design of superconducting qubits to minimize errors. For example, 3D transmon qubits have been developed to reduce sensitivity to charge noise and improve coherence times.\n\n3. Optimizing control pulses: Techniques like DRAG (Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate) pulses and composite pulses are used to minimize control errors during gate operations.\n\n4. System isolation: To reduce decoherence, superconducting quantum computers are often operated at ultra-low temperatures and are shielded from external electromagnetic radiation.\n\n5. Calibration and tuning: Regular calibration and tuning of the quantum devices help in minimizing errors due to drifts in the system parameters.\n\nAs research progresses, we can expect improvements in qubit coherence, fault tolerance, and error correction techniques, which will enable the use of a larger number of qubits in superconducting quantum computers."
