    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of an electron according to relativistic quantum mechanics, we need to use the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE = sqrt((m^2 * c^4) + (p^2 * c^2))\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass of the electron, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the electron.\n\nFirst, let's find the momentum (p) using the relativistic momentum equation:\n\np = m * v / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven values:\nm = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nSubstitute the given values into the momentum equation:\n\np = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (0.8^2))\n\np = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\np = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(0.36)\n\np = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / 0.6\n\np = 3.64 x 10^-22 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum equation to find the energy:\n\nE = sqrt(((9.11 x 10^-31 kg)^2 * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^4) + ((3.64 x 10^-22 kg m/s)^2 * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\n\nE = sqrt((8.30681 x 10^-62 kg^2 m^4/s^4) + (1.32576 x 10^-43 kg^2 m^2/s^2))\n\nE = sqrt(8.30681 x 10^-62 kg^2 m^4/s^4 + 1.32576 x 10^-43 kg^2 m^2/s^2)\n\nE = sqrt(1.32576 x 10^-43 kg^2 m^2/s^2)\n\nE = 3.64 x 10^-22 kg m^2/s^2\n\nE = 3.64 x 10^-22 J (joules)\n\nSo, the energy of the electron with mass 9.11 x 10^-31 kg and velocity of 0.8c according to relativistic quantum mechanics is 3.64 x 10^-22 J."
