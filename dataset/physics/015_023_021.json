    "message_2": "The detectability of gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) depends on several factors, including the distance between the observer and the black hole, the sensitivity of the detector, and the characteristics of the black hole system (mass, spin, etc.).\n\nAs the distance between the observer and the black hole increases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases, making them more challenging to detect. The amplitude of gravitational waves is inversely proportional to the distance between the source and the observer. Specifically, the strain amplitude h (which is a measure of the gravitational wave's effect on spacetime) is given by:\n\nh ‚àù 1 / r\n\nwhere r is the distance between the observer and the black hole.\n\nAs the distance r increases, the strain amplitude h decreases, which means that the gravitational waves become weaker and more difficult to detect. This is because gravitational waves, like electromagnetic waves, follow an inverse-square law, which means that their intensity decreases with the square of the distance from the source.\n\nAdditionally, the frequency of the gravitational waves also plays a role in their detectability. Lower frequency waves are more challenging to detect because they are more susceptible to noise from other sources, such as seismic activity or thermal fluctuations in the detector. Intermediate-mass black holes typically produce gravitational waves with frequencies in the range of 10-100 Hz, which is within the sensitivity range of current detectors like LIGO and Virgo.\n\nIn summary, the detectability of gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes decreases as the distance between the observer and the black hole increases. However, the sensitivity of the detector and the characteristics of the black hole system also play a role in determining the detectability of these gravitational waves. As technology advances and more sensitive detectors are developed, it will become increasingly possible to detect gravitational waves from more distant black hole systems."
