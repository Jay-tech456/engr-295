    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength required to produce a Zeeman effect splitting of 3 spectral lines in atomic hydrogen gas, we need to consider the energy difference between the split levels and the Bohr magneton.\n\nThe Zeeman effect causes the energy levels of an atom to split when subjected to a magnetic field. In the case of hydrogen, the energy levels are split into 2l + 1 sublevels, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Since we want to split the energy levels into 3 spectral lines, we can set 2l + 1 = 3, which gives l = 1.\n\nThe energy difference between the split levels, ΔE, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm\n\nwhere μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and Δm is the change in the magnetic quantum number (m_l). The Bohr magneton for an electron is approximately 9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T.\n\nSince we have l = 1, the possible values for m_l are -1, 0, and 1. The energy difference between the adjacent levels is when Δm = 1.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for B:\n\nB = ΔE / (μ_B * Δm)\n\nHowever, we still need to find the energy difference, ΔE, between the split levels. To do this, we can use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature of the gas. The Boltzmann distribution is given by:\n\nN_i/N = (g_i/g) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n\nwhere N_i is the number of atoms in the higher energy level, N is the total number of atoms, g_i is the degeneracy of the higher energy level, g is the degeneracy of the lower energy level, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K), and T is the temperature.\n\nIn our case, we have a hydrogen gas with a density of 2 x 10^14 atoms/cm^3 and a temperature of 300 K. We can assume that the gas is in thermal equilibrium, so the population of atoms in the higher energy level is negligible compared to the total number of atoms. This means that N_i/N ≈ 0.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Boltzmann distribution formula to solve for ΔE:\n\nΔE = -kT * ln(g_i/g)\n\nSince we have l = 1, the degeneracy of the higher energy level (g_i) is 3, and the degeneracy of the lower energy level (g) is 1. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔE = - (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) * (300 K) * ln(3/1)\nΔE ≈ 3.29 x 10^(-21) J\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula for B:\n\nB = (3.29 x 10^(-21) J) / ((9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * 1)\nB ≈ 0.354 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength required to produce a Zeeman effect splitting of 3 spectral lines in an atomic hydrogen gas of density 2 x 10^14 atoms/cm^3 and temperature 300 K is approximately 0.354 T (tesla)."
