    "message_2": "When an external electric field is applied to hydrogen atoms in the ground state, it can cause a shift in the energy levels and, consequently, a change in the spectral lines. This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect, named after the German physicist Johannes Stark who discovered it in 1913. The Stark effect is the splitting or shifting of spectral lines due to the presence of an external electric field.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen atoms, the ground state is represented by the principal quantum number n=1. The energy levels of hydrogen atoms can be described by the hydrogen atom wavefunctions, which are solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation. These wavefunctions depend on the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied, the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are perturbed, and the wavefunctions are modified. This perturbation can be described using perturbation theory, which is a mathematical technique used to find approximate solutions to complex problems in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe Stark effect can be classified into two types: linear Stark effect and quadratic Stark effect. The linear Stark effect occurs when the energy levels shift linearly with the applied electric field, while the quadratic Stark effect occurs when the energy levels shift quadratically with the applied electric field.\n\nFor hydrogen atoms in the ground state (n=1), the linear Stark effect is not observed because the ground state wavefunction is spherically symmetric and has no electric dipole moment. However, the quadratic Stark effect can be observed, as the energy levels shift quadratically with the applied electric field.\n\nThe quadratic Stark effect can be explained by considering the interaction between the external electric field and the induced electric dipole moment of the hydrogen atom. When an electric field is applied, the electron cloud of the hydrogen atom is distorted, creating an induced electric dipole moment. This induced dipole moment interacts with the external electric field, leading to a change in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom.\n\nAs a result of the Stark effect, the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms in the ground state are shifted or split when an external electric field is applied. This can be observed experimentally using techniques such as spectroscopy, and the observed shifts in the spectral lines can provide valuable information about the properties of the hydrogen atom and the external electric field."
