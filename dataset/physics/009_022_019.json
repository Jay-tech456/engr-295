    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the angle of incidence at which the reflected light at the surface of a medium becomes completely polarized according to Brewster's Law. The refractive index of the medium is given to be 1.5. What is the angle of incidence?",
    "message_2": "According to Brewster's Law, the angle of incidence (θi) at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized can be found using the refractive index (n) of the medium. The formula for Brewster's angle is:\n\ntan(θi) = n\n\nIn this case, the refractive index (n) is given as 1.5. To find the angle of incidence, we can use the inverse tangent function:\n\nθi = arctan(n)\nθi = arctan(1.5)\n\nθi ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized is approximately 56.31 degrees."
