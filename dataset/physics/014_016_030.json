    "message_2": "The maximum dosage of exposure to cosmic rays that a human body can handle depends on the duration and intensity of the exposure. In general, the unit used to measure the biological effect of ionizing radiation is the sievert (Sv). The annual dose limit for radiation workers is set at 20 millisieverts (mSv) per year, averaged over five years, with a maximum of 50 mSv in any single year.\n\nIn space or at high altitudes, the exposure to cosmic rays is significantly higher than on Earth's surface. Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), for example, receive an average dose of about 150 mSv per year, which is considerably higher than the recommended limit for radiation workers on Earth.\n\nProlonged exposure to cosmic rays at high altitudes or in space can have several potential health effects, including:\n\n1. Increased risk of cancer: Ionizing radiation can damage DNA, which may lead to mutations and an increased risk of developing cancer. The risk depends on the dose and duration of exposure, as well as individual factors such as age, gender, and genetic predisposition.\n\n2. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS): Extremely high doses of radiation (greater than 1 Sv) can cause ARS, which is characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. In severe cases, ARS can be fatal.\n\n3. Damage to the central nervous system: High doses of radiation can cause cognitive impairment, memory loss, and other neurological effects.\n\n4. Cataracts: Exposure to ionizing radiation can increase the risk of developing cataracts, which can impair vision.\n\n5. Cardiovascular diseases: Some studies suggest that exposure to ionizing radiation may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, although more research is needed to confirm this association.\n\n6. Degenerative tissue effects: High doses of radiation can cause damage to tissues such as bone, skin, and the reproductive system, leading to various health issues.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, astronauts and other individuals exposed to cosmic rays at high altitudes or in space must follow strict safety protocols, including shielding, monitoring radiation exposure, and limiting the duration of missions."
