    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer for a flat plate under turbulent flow conditions, we can use the following formula:\n\nδ = (0.37 * x) / (Re_x)^0.2\n\nwhere δ is the boundary layer thickness, x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate (0.3 m in this case), and Re_x is the Reynolds number at distance x.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Reynolds number at the given distance. The Reynolds number is given by:\n\nRe_x = (ρ * U * x) / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, U is the velocity of the fluid (10 m/s), x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate (0.3 m), and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (0.001 Ns/m²).\n\nAssuming the fluid is water at room temperature, the density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³. Now we can calculate the Reynolds number:\n\nRe_x = (1000 kg/m³ * 10 m/s * 0.3 m) / (0.001 Ns/m²)\nRe_x = 3,000,000\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (0.37 * 0.3 m) / (3,000,000)^0.2\nδ ≈ 0.0375 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.3 m from the leading edge of the plate under turbulent flow conditions is approximately 0.0375 meters or 37.5 millimeters."
