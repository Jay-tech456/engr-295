    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at points both inside and outside of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, let's consider the magnetic field outside the wire (r > R). We can choose a circular Amperian loop with radius r (r > R) centered on the axis of the wire. The magnetic field will be tangential to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral of B can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nSince the entire current I is enclosed by the loop, we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nNext, let's consider the magnetic field inside the wire (r < R). We can choose a circular Amperian loop with radius r (r < R) centered on the axis of the wire. The magnetic field will again be tangential to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral of B can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nHowever, now only a fraction of the total current I is enclosed by the loop. If we assume the current density J is uniform across the wire, we can write the enclosed current I_enclosed as:\n\nI_enclosed = J * Area_enclosed = (I / πR²) * πr²\n\nNow, we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * (I / πR²) * πr²\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB_inside = (μ₀Ir) / (2πR²)\n\nIn summary, the magnetic field at points both inside and outside of the wire can be expressed as:\n\nB(r) = { (μ₀Ir) / (2πR²) , for r < R\n          { (μ₀I) / (2πr) , for r > R"
