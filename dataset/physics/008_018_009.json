    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant (αs) is a fundamental parameter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong nuclear force that binds quarks and gluons together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale (s) at which it is probed, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. This means that the strength of the strong force decreases as the energy scale increases (or the distance between quarks decreases).\n\nTo find the value of αs at a given energy scale, we use the renormalization group equation, which relates αs at different energy scales. The equation is:\n\nαs(μ²) = αs(μ₀²) / (1 + (b₀ * αs(μ₀²) * ln(μ²/μ₀²) / (2π)))\n\nHere, μ² is the energy scale of interest, μ₀² is a reference energy scale, b₀ is the first coefficient of the beta function in QCD, and αs(μ₀²) is the value of the strong coupling constant at the reference energy scale.\n\nExperimentally, αs can be determined from various processes in high-energy physics, such as electron-positron annihilation, deep inelastic scattering, and hadron collider experiments. The experimental determination of αs involves comparing the measured cross-sections or decay rates of these processes with the theoretical predictions from QCD, which depend on αs. By fitting the experimental data to the theoretical predictions, the value of αs can be extracted.\n\nThe Particle Data Group (PDG) provides a world-average value of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (μ = Mz ≈ 91.2 GeV) as αs(Mz²) ≈ 0.1181, with an uncertainty of about 0.5%. However, it's important to note that the value of αs depends on the energy scale, so it will be different at other energy scales."
