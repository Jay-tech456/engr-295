    "message_2": "The chemical shift (δ) is a dimensionless quantity that describes the difference in resonance frequency (Δν) of a nucleus in a sample compared to a reference compound, relative to the operating frequency (ν0) of the spectrometer. The chemical shift is usually reported in parts per million (ppm). The formula for calculating the chemical shift is:\n\nδ = (Δν / ν0) * 10^6\n\nFirst, we need to determine the operating frequency (ν0) of the spectrometer. The operating frequency is related to the magnetic field strength (B0) and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of the nucleus being studied. The relationship is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nν0 = γ * B0 / (2 * π)\n\nFor proton NMR, the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of a proton is approximately 267.513 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. Given the magnetic field strength (B0) of 7.89 Tesla, we can calculate the operating frequency:\n\nν0 = (267.513 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1) * (7.89 T) / (2 * π)\nν0 ≈ 334.6 * 10^6 Hz\n\nNow that we have the operating frequency, we can calculate the difference in chemical shift (Δδ) between the two resonances with a frequency difference (Δν) of 125 Hz:\n\nΔδ = (Δν / ν0) * 10^6\nΔδ = (125 Hz / 334.6 * 10^6 Hz) * 10^6\nΔδ ≈ 0.373 ppm\n\nTherefore, the difference in chemical shift between the two resonances is approximately 0.373 ppm."
