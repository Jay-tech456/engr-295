    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire carrying a current:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and z is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, we have a helix, which can be thought of as a series of circular loops stacked on top of each other. To find the total magnetic field at the center of the helix, we need to sum the contributions from each loop.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of loops in the helix. We can do this by dividing the height of the helix by the height of each loop. Since the helix is 5 cm tall and has a radius of 2 cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of each loop:\n\nh = sqrt(5² - 2²) = sqrt(21) cm\n\nNow, let's assume there are N loops in the helix. Then, the height of the helix is N * h:\n\n5 cm = N * sqrt(21) cm\n\nN = 5 / sqrt(21) ≈ 1.095\n\nSince the number of loops is not an integer, we can approximate the helix as a single loop with a radius of 2 cm and a height of 5 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * (0.02 m)²) / (2 * ((0.02 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (3.1831 × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * (0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.59 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the helix is approximately 1.59 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
