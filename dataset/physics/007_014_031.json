    "message_2": "To find the radius of a gold atom nucleus, we can use the formula for the nuclear radius, which is given by:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the nuclear radius, R₀ is a constant (approximately 1.2 femtometers), and A is the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons).\n\nIn the case of a gold atom, the atomic number is 79, which means it has 79 protons. It also has 118 neutrons. Therefore, the mass number A is:\n\nA = 79 (protons) + 118 (neutrons) = 197\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the radius:\n\nR = 1.2 fm * (197)^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.2 fm * (197)^(0.333)\nR ≈ 1.2 fm * 5.81\nR ≈ 6.97 fm\n\nSo, the radius of a gold atom nucleus is approximately 6.97 femtometers."
