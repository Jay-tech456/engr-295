    "message_2": "The one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle in an infinite potential well of width \"a\" is given by:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the infinite potential well are:\n\nψ(0) = 0 and ψ(a) = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can propose a solution of the form:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude and k is the wave number. The second derivative of ψ(x) with respect to x is:\n\n(d²ψ(x) / dx²) = -k² * A * sin(kx)\n\nSubstituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (-k² * A * sin(kx)) = E * A * sin(kx)\n\nDividing both sides by A * sin(kx), we obtain the energy:\n\nE = (ħ² * k²) / (2m)\n\nNow, applying the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) = 0, which is always satisfied.\n\nψ(a) = A * sin(ka) = 0\n\nFor this condition to be satisfied, we must have:\n\nka = n * π, where n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nThe wave number k can be expressed as:\n\nk = (n * π) / a\n\nNow, we can find the energy spectrum by substituting k back into the energy equation:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * k²) / (2m) = (ħ² * (n * π / a)²) / (2m) = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2m * a²)\n\nSo the energy spectrum of the particle is quantized and given by:\n\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2m * a²), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nAnd the corresponding wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = A * sin((n * π * x) / a), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe normalization constant A can be found by imposing the normalization condition:\n\n∫[0, a] |ψ_n(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSolving for A, we get:\n\nA = sqrt(2 / a)"
