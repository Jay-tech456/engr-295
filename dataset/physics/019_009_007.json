    "message_2": "The beta function of a quantum field theory describes how the coupling constants change with the energy scale. In the case of a scalar φ^4 theory in two dimensions, the Lagrangian density is given by:\n\nℒ = (∂μφ)(∂^μφ) - m^2 φ^2 - λ φ^4\n\nwhere λ is the coupling constant of the φ^4 interaction term. To compute the beta function, we need to regularize the theory to deal with divergences. In this case, we use point-splitting regularization.\n\nIn point-splitting regularization, we introduce a small separation ε between the interacting fields. The regularized φ^4 interaction term becomes:\n\nλ φ^4 → λ φ(x)φ(x)φ(x + ε)φ(x + ε)\n\nNow, we compute the one-loop correction to the φ^4 vertex using this regularized interaction term. The one-loop correction will be proportional to the two-point function:\n\nΓ(2)(x, x + ε) = ⟨φ(x)φ(x + ε)⟩\n\nIn two dimensions, the two-point function has the following behavior at short distances:\n\nΓ(2)(x, x + ε) ~ (1/4π) log(ε^2/μ^2)\n\nwhere μ is an arbitrary mass scale introduced to make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless.\n\nThe one-loop correction to the φ^4 vertex is then proportional to:\n\nΔλ ~ λ^2 ∫ d^2x Γ(2)(x, x + ε)\n\nPerforming the integral, we find:\n\nΔλ ~ (λ^2/4π) log(ε^2/μ^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the beta function, which describes the change in the coupling constant λ with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale:\n\nβ(λ) = dλ/d(log μ)\n\nUsing the result for Δλ, we find:\n\nβ(λ) = (λ^2/4π)\n\nThis is the beta function for the scalar φ^4 theory in two dimensions when regularized by point-splitting regularization. Note that the beta function is positive, indicating that the coupling constant λ increases with the energy scale, which is a signature of a non-asymptotically free theory."
