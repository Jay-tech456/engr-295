    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.10 m from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the problem involves a sphere, it is more convenient to use Ampere's law.\n\nAmpere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a sphere with a current uniformly distributed on its surface, the magnetic field is symmetrical and has the same magnitude at every point on a circular path centered on the sphere. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's law as follows:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, r is the distance from the center of the sphere, and I is the current enclosed by the loop.\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field at a distance of 0.10 m from the center of the sphere, we have:\n\nr = 0.10 m\n\nThe current enclosed by the loop is the same as the current flowing through the sphere, which is:\n\nI = 2 A\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is:\n\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB * 2π(0.10) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 2\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2) / (2π * 0.10)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2) / (0.20π)\nB = 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 0.10 m from the center of the sphere is 4 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
