    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the adiabatic compression process, we can use the following formula:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ is the adiabatic index.\n\nWe are given the initial volume (V1 = 50 L), final volume (V2 = 20 L), initial pressure (P1 = 2 atm), and γ value (γ = 1.4). We need to find the final pressure (P2) before we can calculate the work done.\n\nFor an adiabatic process, we can use the following relation between initial and final pressure and volume:\n\n(P1 * V1^γ) = (P2 * V2^γ)\n\nWe can solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ\n\nP2 = 2 atm * (50 L / 20 L)^1.4\n\nP2 ≈ 5.98 atm\n\nNow that we have the final pressure, we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = (2 atm * 50 L - 5.98 atm * 20 L) / (1.4 - 1)\n\nW ≈ (-19.6 atm * L) / 0.4\n\nW ≈ -49 L * atm\n\nThe work done by the gas during the adiabatic compression process is approximately -49 L * atm. The negative sign indicates that the work is done on the gas (compression), rather than by the gas (expansion)."
