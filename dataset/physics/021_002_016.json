    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the radius of the event horizon for a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses. Using this information, the student should then determine the Schwarzschild radius and the surface area of the event horizon.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), we can use the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nTo calculate the surface area of the event horizon, we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n\nA = 4πr^2\n\nwhere r is the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nA = 4π(2.95 x 10^4 m)^2\nA ≈ 1.1 x 10^9 m^2\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the event horizon is approximately 1.1 x 10^9 square meters."
