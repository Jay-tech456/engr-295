    "message_2": "To find the nuclear radius of an atom, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the given density. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nThe mass of the nucleus can be calculated using the mass number (A) and the atomic mass unit (u), which is approximately 1.66 × 10^-27 kg:\n\nmass = A × u\nmass = 40 × 1.66 × 10^-27 kg\nmass ≈ 6.64 × 10^-26 kg\n\nNow, we can use the given density (ρ) to find the volume of the nucleus:\n\ndensity = mass/volume\nρ = 2.5 × 10^17 kg/m^3\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the volume:\n\nvolume = mass/density\nvolume ≈ (6.64 × 10^-26 kg) / (2.5 × 10^17 kg/m^3)\nvolume ≈ 2.656 × 10^-43 m^3\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the radius:\n\n(4/3)πr^3 = 2.656 × 10^-43 m^3\n\nDivide both sides by (4/3)π:\n\nr^3 = (2.656 × 10^-43 m^3) / ((4/3)π)\nr^3 ≈ 6.34 × 10^-44 m^3\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides to find the radius:\n\nr ≈ (6.34 × 10^-44 m^3)^(1/3)\nr ≈ 1.85 × 10^-15 m\n\nTo convert the radius to femtometers (1 fm = 10^-15 m), multiply by 10^15:\n\nr ≈ 1.85 × 10^(-15+15) fm\nr ≈ 1.85 fm\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of the atom is approximately 1.85 femtometers."
