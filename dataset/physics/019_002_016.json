    "message_2": "The renormalization group (RG) method is a powerful tool in quantum field theory (QFT) that helps to understand the behavior of systems at different length scales, particularly near phase transitions. The critical exponent is a key quantity that characterizes the behavior of physical observables near the critical point. In this explanation, we will use the example of the scalar φ⁴ field theory, which is a simple and widely studied QFT.\n\nThe scalar φ⁴ field theory is described by the Lagrangian density:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂μφ)(∂μφ) - m²/2 φ² - λ/4! φ⁴\n\nHere, φ is the scalar field, m is the mass parameter, and λ is the coupling constant. The goal is to compute the critical exponent, which describes the behavior of correlation functions near the critical point, where the correlation length diverges.\n\nThe renormalization group method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Introduce a momentum cutoff Λ: To regularize the theory, we introduce an ultraviolet momentum cutoff Λ, which restricts the range of momenta in the theory. This allows us to avoid the divergences that arise in perturbative calculations.\n\n2. Perform a coarse-graining: The RG method involves integrating out high-momentum modes of the field to obtain an effective theory at lower energy scales. This is done by separating the field into fast and slow modes, φ = φ_fast + φ_slow, and integrating out the fast modes. This results in a new effective action, which describes the physics at the reduced scale.\n\n3. Rescale the fields and coordinates: After integrating out the fast modes, we rescale the fields and coordinates to restore the original form of the action. This involves rescaling the field φ_slow → Zφ_slow and the coordinates x → x/b, where Z and b are the field and coordinate rescaling factors, respectively.\n\n4. Renormalize the parameters: The rescaling process introduces new values for the mass and coupling parameters, m' and λ'. These new parameters are related to the original parameters through the renormalization group equations, which describe how the parameters change under the rescaling.\n\n5. Determine the fixed points: The fixed points of the renormalization group flow are the points in parameter space where the parameters do not change under the RG transformation. These fixed points correspond to scale-invariant theories and are associated with critical points in the phase diagram.\n\n6. Compute the critical exponents: Near the fixed points, the behavior of the correlation functions is determined by the critical exponents. These exponents can be computed from the linearized RG transformation near the fixed point. The critical exponents are related to the eigenvalues of the stability matrix, which describes the response of the system to small perturbations around the fixed point.\n\nIn summary, the renormalization group method allows us to systematically study the behavior of quantum field theories at different length scales and compute critical exponents near phase transitions. By applying the RG method to the scalar φ⁴ field theory, we can gain insight into the critical behavior of the system and understand the role of the critical exponents in characterizing the properties of the theory near the critical point."
