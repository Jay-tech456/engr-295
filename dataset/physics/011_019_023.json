    "message_1": "A crystal has a length of 5 cm at 20°C. If the thermal expansion coefficient of the crystal is 2.3 x 10^-5 /°C, what will be the length of the crystal when the temperature is increased to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the crystal when the temperature is increased to 50°C, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L₀ is the initial length, α is the thermal expansion coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature:\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔL = (5 cm) * (2.3 x 10^-5 /°C) * (30°C)\n\nΔL = 5 cm * 2.3 x 10^-5 /°C * 30°C\n\nΔL ≈ 0.00345 cm\n\nNow, we can find the final length of the crystal by adding the change in length to the initial length:\n\nL_final = L₀ + ΔL = 5 cm + 0.00345 cm ≈ 5.00345 cm\n\nSo, the length of the crystal when the temperature is increased to 50°C is approximately 5.00345 cm."
