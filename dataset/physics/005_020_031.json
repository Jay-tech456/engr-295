    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth at a speed of 0.8c. An astronaut on the spaceship is transmitting a radio wave with a frequency of 10 MHz. What is the frequency of the radio wave as observed by an observer on Earth? (Assume the speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/s)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which is given by:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed on Earth, f_source is the frequency of the radio wave transmitted by the astronaut (10 MHz), v is the speed of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values:\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nNow, calculate the square root:\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * 3\n\nFinally, multiply the frequency by the factor:\n\nf_observed = 30 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the radio wave as observed by an observer on Earth is 30 MHz."
