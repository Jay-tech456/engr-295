    "message_2": "As a black hole's mass increases, the dynamics of an accretion disk surrounding it undergo several changes. Here are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1. Gravitational force: As the mass of the black hole increases, its gravitational force also increases. This stronger gravitational pull attracts more matter from the surrounding environment, causing the accretion disk to grow in size and mass.\n\n2. Orbital velocity: The orbital velocity of particles in the accretion disk is determined by the balance between the gravitational force exerted by the black hole and the centrifugal force experienced by the particles. As the black hole's mass increases, the required orbital velocity for particles to maintain a stable orbit also increases. This results in particles moving faster in the accretion disk.\n\n3. Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO): The ISCO is the smallest stable orbit that matter can have around a black hole. As the black hole's mass increases, the radius of the ISCO also increases. This means that the inner edge of the accretion disk moves further away from the black hole.\n\n4. Accretion rate: With a more massive black hole, the accretion rate (the rate at which matter falls into the black hole) generally increases. This is due to the stronger gravitational pull, which causes more matter to be drawn in from the accretion disk.\n\n5. Disk temperature and radiation: As the accretion rate increases, the temperature of the accretion disk also increases due to the increased friction between particles. This results in the disk emitting more radiation, primarily in the form of X-rays.\n\n6. Viscosity and turbulence: The increased mass of the black hole and the higher accretion rate can lead to increased viscosity and turbulence within the accretion disk. This can cause the disk to become more unstable and prone to fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, as a black hole's mass increases, its accretion disk experiences changes in size, mass, orbital velocity, temperature, and stability. These changes can have significant effects on the overall dynamics and behavior of the accretion disk."
