    "message_2": "To optimize a portfolio of 10 stocks using quantum annealing, we will first need to define the problem mathematically. The objective is to maximize the expected return while minimizing risk and transaction costs. We can represent this as a quadratic optimization problem.\n\nLet's denote the expected return of each stock as Ri, the weight of each stock in the portfolio as Wi, the risk factor as Rf, and the transaction costs as Tc. The covariance matrix representing the risk between the stocks is denoted as Cij.\n\nOur objective function to minimize can be represented as:\n\nF(W) = -∑(Wi * Ri) + Rf * ∑(Wi * Wj * Cij) + Tc * ∑(|Wi - Wj|)\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\n∑Wi = 1\n\nNow, we can map this quadratic optimization problem to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be solved using quantum annealing.\n\nTo do this, we will represent the weights Wi as binary variables. For example, if we want to represent the weights with a precision of 1%, we can use 7 binary variables (since 2^7 = 128, which is enough to represent 100 percentage points).\n\nNext, we will create a QUBO matrix Q, where the elements Qij represent the coefficients of the binary variables in the objective function. The diagonal elements of the matrix will correspond to the linear terms, and the off-diagonal elements will correspond to the quadratic terms.\n\nOnce the QUBO matrix is constructed, we can use a quantum annealer to find the optimal binary values for the weights Wi that minimize the objective function F(W). The quantum annealer will explore the solution space and find the global minimum by exploiting quantum effects such as tunneling and superposition.\n\nFinally, we can convert the binary values back to the corresponding weight percentages and obtain the optimized portfolio of 10 stocks with different weights and expected returns, considering the given risk factor and transaction costs."
