    "message_2": "To ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state to its first excited state, we need to provide energy equal to the energy difference between the two states. In this case, the energy difference is given as 10.2 eV. Therefore, the energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom is 10.2 eV."
