    "message_2": "The relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the amount of energy absorbed by biological systems can be described by the Planck's equation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electromagnetic radiation, h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.63 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the radiation.\n\nAs the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation increases, so does the energy it carries. This means that higher frequency radiation has the potential to cause more damage to biological systems, as it can transfer more energy to the molecules and atoms within the organism.\n\nThe overall effect of electromagnetic radiation on living organisms depends on several factors, including the frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure. In general, lower frequency radiation (such as radio waves and microwaves) is considered non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms. Non-ionizing radiation can still cause damage to biological systems, but typically through heating effects, as it can cause molecules to vibrate and generate heat.\n\nHigher frequency radiation (such as ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays) is considered ionizing, as it has enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, creating ions. Ionizing radiation can cause significant damage to biological systems, as it can break chemical bonds, damage DNA, and disrupt cellular processes. This can lead to various health issues, including burns, radiation sickness, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nThe impact of electromagnetic radiation on living organisms also depends on the organism's ability to repair the damage caused by the radiation. Some organisms have more efficient repair mechanisms, which can mitigate the harmful effects of radiation exposure.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the amount of energy absorbed by biological systems is directly proportional, with higher frequency radiation carrying more energy and having the potential to cause more damage. The overall effect of electromagnetic radiation on living organisms depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure, as well as the organism's ability to repair the damage caused by the radiation."
