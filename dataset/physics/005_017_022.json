    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concepts of relativistic kinetic energy and momentum. The relativistic kinetic energy (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. The relativistic momentum (p) is given by:\n\np = γmv\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) for the particle:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (1.6667 - 1)(2 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 0.6667 x 2 x (3 x 10^8)^2\nK ≈ 5.997 x 10^16 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the particle relative to an observer at rest on the target is approximately 5.997 x 10^16 Joules.\n\nNext, we can find the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np = 1.6667 x 2 kg x 0.8c\np ≈ 1.6667 x 2 x 0.8 x (3 x 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 8.000 x 10^8 kg m/s\n\nThe momentum of the particle relative to the observer on the target is approximately 8.000 x 10^8 kg m/s."
