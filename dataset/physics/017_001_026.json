    "message_2": "When graphene undergoes strain, its electronic properties change due to the modification of its lattice structure and the consequent alteration of its band structure. Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Its unique electronic properties arise from its linear energy-momentum dispersion relation, which leads to massless Dirac fermions and high electron mobility.\n\nTo analyze the band structure of strained graphene, we need to consider the effect of strain on the lattice vectors and the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Strain can be applied either uniaxially (along one direction) or biaxially (along both directions). The change in the lattice vectors can be described by a strain tensor, which modifies the hopping parameters between carbon atoms in the tight-binding Hamiltonian.\n\nUpon applying strain, the linear energy-momentum dispersion relation of graphene is distorted, leading to changes in the band structure. The most significant effect of strain is the opening of a bandgap at the Dirac points, which are the points in the Brillouin zone where the conduction and valence bands meet. This bandgap opening depends on the magnitude and direction of the applied strain.\n\nTo calculate the electrical conductivity of strained graphene, we can use the Kubo formula, which relates the conductivity to the current-current correlation function. The Kubo formula can be expressed as:\n\nσ(ω) = (e^2/h) * ∫(dE) * (f(E) - f(E+ħω)) * A(E,ω) / (ħω)\n\nwhere σ(ω) is the conductivity, e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant, f(E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the frequency, and A(E,ω) is the spectral function.\n\nThe spectral function A(E,ω) can be obtained from the Green's function of the tight-binding Hamiltonian, which can be calculated using the lattice vectors and hopping parameters modified by the strain tensor. The Fermi-Dirac distribution function f(E) depends on the temperature and the Fermi energy, which can be adjusted to account for doping or gating effects.\n\nBy solving the Kubo formula with the modified band structure, we can obtain the electrical conductivity of strained graphene as a function of frequency, temperature, and Fermi energy. In general, the conductivity of graphene decreases with increasing strain due to the opening of the bandgap and the reduction of the density of states at the Fermi level. However, the specific dependence of the conductivity on the strain magnitude and direction, as well as on the doping or gating conditions, requires a detailed numerical analysis."
