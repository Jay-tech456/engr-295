    "message_2": "The behavior of matter and radiation near a black hole is significantly different from their behavior outside the event horizon due to the extreme gravitational forces and spacetime curvature near the black hole. Here are some key differences:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Near a black hole, the gravitational force becomes extremely strong, even for objects that are still outside the event horizon. This intense gravitational pull can cause matter to be stretched and compressed, a phenomenon known as \"spaghettification.\" As objects get closer to the event horizon, the gravitational force becomes stronger, eventually reaching a point where it is impossible for the object to escape.\n\n2. Time dilation: According to the general theory of relativity, the presence of a massive object like a black hole causes spacetime to curve. As a result, time flows more slowly near a black hole compared to regions farther away. This effect, known as gravitational time dilation, becomes more pronounced as one approaches the event horizon. For an observer far away from the black hole, it would appear as if time has stopped for objects at the event horizon.\n\n3. Accretion disk formation: Due to the strong gravitational forces near a black hole, matter and radiation falling towards it often form an accretion disk. This disk consists of matter and radiation spiraling around the black hole, gradually losing energy and falling inwards. The friction and collisions within the accretion disk cause it to heat up and emit radiation, making it a source of observable light.\n\n4. Radiation emission: Near a black hole, radiation behaves differently due to the intense gravitational field. For example, the phenomenon of gravitational redshift causes the wavelength of light to increase (or \"redshift\") as it moves away from the black hole. Additionally, black holes can emit radiation through a process called Hawking radiation, which is a quantum effect that occurs near the event horizon.\n\n5. Tidal forces: The difference in gravitational forces experienced by objects near a black hole can lead to tidal forces, which can tear apart objects that come too close. These forces become stronger as the distance to the event horizon decreases, eventually reaching a point where they can overcome the internal forces holding an object together.\n\nIn summary, the behavior of matter and radiation near a black hole is significantly different from their behavior outside the event horizon due to the extreme gravitational forces, spacetime curvature, and other relativistic effects. These differences lead to phenomena such as spaghettification, time dilation, accretion disk formation, radiation emission, and tidal forces."
