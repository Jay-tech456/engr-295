    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force and lift force acting on the ball, we need to use the drag equation and lift equation. The drag equation is:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * ρ * v^2 * A * C_D\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the object, A is the reference area, and C_D is the drag coefficient.\n\nThe lift equation is:\n\nF_L = 0.5 * ρ * v^2 * A * C_L\n\nwhere F_L is the lift force, and C_L is the lift coefficient.\n\nFirst, let's find the reference area (A) of the ball. The reference area is the cross-sectional area of the ball, which can be calculated as:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the ball.\n\nA = π * (0.05 m / 2)^2\nA ≈ 0.0019635 m²\n\nNow, we need to find the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the drag coefficient (C_D) and lift coefficient (C_L). The Reynolds number is given by:\n\nRe = (ρ * v * d) / μ\n\nwhere μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nRe = (1000 kg/m³ * 10 m/s * 0.05 m) / (1 x 10^-3 Pa·s)\nRe = 500,000\n\nFor a sphere, the drag coefficient (C_D) can be approximated as 0.47 for Reynolds numbers between 10^4 and 10^6. Since our Reynolds number is within this range, we can use C_D = 0.47.\n\nThe lift coefficient (C_L) for a sphere is generally very small and can be considered negligible in most cases. Therefore, we will assume C_L = 0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force (F_D) and lift force (F_L):\n\nF_D = 0.5 * 1000 kg/m³ * (10 m/s)^2 * 0.0019635 m² * 0.47\nF_D ≈ 46.5875 N\n\nF_L = 0.5 * 1000 kg/m³ * (10 m/s)^2 * 0.0019635 m² * 0\nF_L = 0 N\n\nSo, the drag force acting on the ball is approximately 46.59 N, and the lift force is 0 N."
