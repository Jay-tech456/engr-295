    "message_1": "A spacecraft is hovering close to a massive planet. If an astronaut on board the spacecraft emits a photon of light towards the planet, what will be the wavelength and frequency of the photon when it reaches the planet's surface? (Assume the planet's gravity causes a redshift of 2000 Hz.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the gravitational redshift effect on the emitted photon. The redshift causes the photon's frequency to decrease and its wavelength to increase as it moves towards the planet's surface.\n\nLet's denote the initial frequency of the emitted photon as f₀ and the final frequency as f₁. The redshift causes a decrease in frequency by 2000 Hz, so we have:\n\nf₁ = f₀ - 2000 Hz\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding change in wavelength. The speed of light (c) is constant and is related to the frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) by the equation:\n\nc = fλ\n\nLet's denote the initial wavelength as λ₀ and the final wavelength as λ₁. Since the speed of light is constant, we can write:\n\nc = f₀λ₀ = f₁λ₁\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for f₁ from above:\n\nc = f₀λ₀ = (f₀ - 2000)λ₁\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₀ and λ₁, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nλ₁ = (f₀ / (f₀ - 2000)) λ₀\n\nThis equation shows that the final wavelength (λ₁) is related to the initial wavelength (λ₀) and the initial frequency (f₀). However, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of λ₀ and f₀. If we know the initial frequency or wavelength of the emitted photon, we can use the above equation to find the final wavelength and then use the speed of light equation to find the final frequency.\n\nIn summary, without knowing the initial frequency or wavelength of the emitted photon, we cannot determine the exact values of the final wavelength and frequency. However, we can say that the final frequency will be 2000 Hz lower than the initial frequency, and the final wavelength will be longer than the initial wavelength due to the gravitational redshift effect."
