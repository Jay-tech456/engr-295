    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Archimedes' Principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force must be equal to the weight that the helium balloon needs to lift (20 N).\n\nLet V be the volume of the helium balloon. The mass of the air displaced by the balloon is equal to the volume multiplied by the air density (ρ_air):\n\nm_air = V * ρ_air\n\nThe weight of the displaced air (W_air) is equal to the mass multiplied by the gravitational acceleration (g ≈ 9.81 m/s²):\n\nW_air = m_air * g = V * ρ_air * g\n\nSimilarly, the mass of the helium inside the balloon is equal to the volume multiplied by the helium density (ρ_helium):\n\nm_helium = V * ρ_helium\n\nThe weight of the helium (W_helium) is equal to the mass multiplied by the gravitational acceleration:\n\nW_helium = m_helium * g = V * ρ_helium * g\n\nAccording to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force (which is equal to the weight of the displaced air) must be equal to the sum of the weight of the helium and the weight that needs to be lifted (20 N):\n\nW_air = W_helium + 20 N\n\nSubstituting the expressions for W_air and W_helium, we get:\n\nV * ρ_air * g = V * ρ_helium * g + 20 N\n\nWe can now solve for V:\n\nV * (ρ_air - ρ_helium) * g = 20 N\n\nV = 20 N / ((ρ_air - ρ_helium) * g)\n\nPlugging in the given values for air density (1.2 kg/m³), helium density (0.179 kg/m³), and gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²):\n\nV = 20 N / ((1.2 kg/m³ - 0.179 kg/m³) * 9.81 m/s²)\n\nV ≈ 0.238 m³\n\nTherefore, the minimum volume of a spherical helium balloon required to lift a weight of 20 N at sea level is approximately 0.238 cubic meters."
