    "message_1": "A generator has a circular coil of 200 turns and a radius of 0.5 m. It is carrying an electric current of 10 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 10 A\nN = 200 turns\nR = 0.5 m\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 10 A * 200) / (2 * 0.5 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁶ T * 200) / 1\n\nB = 1600π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nB ≈ 5.027 × 10⁻³ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 5.027 × 10⁻³ T (Tesla)."
