    "message_2": "The maximum mass limit for a white dwarf star is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, named after the Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. The Chandrasekhar limit is approximately 1.4 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is equal to the mass of our Sun).\n\nWhen a white dwarf exceeds this limit, it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse due to electron degeneracy pressure. This leads to one of two possible outcomes:\n\n1. If the white dwarf is part of a binary system and is accreting mass from its companion star, it may undergo a thermonuclear explosion known as a Type Ia supernova. This occurs when the temperature and pressure at the core become high enough to ignite carbon fusion, resulting in a runaway nuclear reaction that destroys the white dwarf and releases a tremendous amount of energy.\n\n2. If the white dwarf does not undergo a Type Ia supernova, it may collapse into a more compact object, such as a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass and other factors. In this case, the core of the white dwarf is compressed to the point where protons and electrons combine to form neutrons, and the object becomes a neutron star. If the mass is even greater, the gravitational force may be strong enough to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure, leading to the formation of a black hole."
