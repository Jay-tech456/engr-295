    "message_1": "A particle is moving at a velocity of 0.9c with respect to an observer on Earth. What will be the time dilation factor experienced by the particle if its proper time is 1 hour?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor, we can use the Lorentz factor formula:\n\nLorentz factor (γ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's square the velocity and divide it by the speed of light squared:\n\n(0.9c)^2 / c^2 = 0.81\n\nNow, subtract this value from 1:\n\n1 - 0.81 = 0.19\n\nNext, find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.4359\n\nFinally, divide 1 by this square root to find the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / 0.4359 ≈ 2.294\n\nThe time dilation factor (Lorentz factor) is approximately 2.294. This means that 1 hour of proper time experienced by the particle will be perceived as approximately 2.294 hours by the observer on Earth."
