    "message_2": "In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the resonance frequency of a sample is directly related to the strength of the external magnetic field. The principle behind NMR is based on the interaction between the magnetic moments of atomic nuclei (usually 1H, 13C, or 15N) and an external magnetic field. When placed in an external magnetic field, the nuclear spins of these atoms align either parallel or anti-parallel to the field, resulting in different energy levels.\n\nThe resonance frequency, also known as the Larmor frequency, is the frequency at which the nuclear spins flip between these energy levels when subjected to a radiofrequency (RF) pulse. The Larmor frequency (ν) is given by the equation:\n\nν = γ * B0\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (a constant specific to the nucleus being studied) and B0 is the strength of the external magnetic field.\n\nFrom this equation, it is evident that the resonance frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the external magnetic field. As the magnetic field strength (B0) increases, the resonance frequency (ν) also increases, and vice versa. This relationship is crucial in NMR spectroscopy, as it allows for the differentiation of chemical environments in a sample based on their unique resonance frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the change in the external magnetic field affects the resonance frequency of a sample in NMR spectroscopy by altering the Larmor frequency at which the nuclear spins flip between energy levels. An increase in the magnetic field strength leads to an increase in the resonance frequency, while a decrease in the magnetic field strength results in a decrease in the resonance frequency."
