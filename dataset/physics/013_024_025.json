    "message_2": "The energy of cosmic rays is directly related to their ability to penetrate and affect the human body. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. When these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and other charged particles, which can penetrate the human body and cause biological damage.\n\nThe relationship between the energy of cosmic rays and their penetration ability can be understood through the concept of ionizing radiation. Higher-energy cosmic rays have a greater ability to ionize atoms and molecules in the human body, which can lead to cellular damage, DNA mutations, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nThe penetration and effect of cosmic rays on the human body change with altitude and atmospheric conditions. At higher altitudes, the Earth's atmosphere is thinner, providing less shielding against cosmic rays. As a result, the intensity of cosmic rays increases with altitude, leading to a higher exposure risk for individuals at higher elevations, such as pilots, astronauts, and mountain climbers.\n\nAtmospheric conditions, such as solar activity and Earth's magnetic field, can also influence the intensity and penetration of cosmic rays. During periods of high solar activity, the Sun's magnetic field can deflect some cosmic rays, reducing their intensity at Earth. Conversely, during periods of low solar activity, cosmic ray intensity can increase. Earth's magnetic field also provides some protection against cosmic rays, with the shielding effect being stronger near the equator and weaker near the poles.\n\nIn summary, the energy of cosmic rays is directly related to their ability to penetrate and affect the human body. This relationship is influenced by altitude and atmospheric conditions, with higher altitudes and weaker magnetic shielding leading to increased cosmic ray exposure and potential biological effects."
