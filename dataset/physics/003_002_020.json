    "message_1": "A physics student is tasked to calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a solenoid with 200 turns per meter, carrying a current of 2.5 A and having a radius of 0.05 meters. What is the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid in Tesla?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per meter, and I is the current in Amperes.\n\nGiven the values:\nn = 200 turns/meter\nI = 2.5 A\n\nWe can now calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (200 turns/m) * (2.5 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (500 turns*m/A)\n\nB ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid is approximately 6.28 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
