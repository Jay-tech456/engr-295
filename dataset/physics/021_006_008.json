    "message_2": "Black holes can significantly affect the orbital stability of planets and other celestial bodies that surround them due to their immense gravitational pull. The closer a planet is to a black hole, the stronger the gravitational force it experiences, which can lead to orbital disruptions, tidal forces, and eventually, destruction.\n\nThe minimum distance a planet can be from a black hole before being pulled in and destroyed depends on the black hole's mass and the planet's orbital velocity. This distance is often referred to as the Roche limit, which is the point at which the tidal forces from the black hole become stronger than the planet's own gravitational forces, causing it to disintegrate.\n\nTo calculate the Roche limit, we can use the following formula:\n\nRoche limit = R * (2 * M_bh / M_p)^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the planet, M_bh is the mass of the black hole, and M_p is the mass of the planet.\n\nHowever, the Roche limit only considers the tidal forces that cause a planet to disintegrate. To avoid being pulled into the black hole, a planet must also maintain a stable orbit outside the black hole's event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.\n\nThe event horizon radius, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * G * M_bh / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_bh is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn summary, a planet must maintain a distance greater than both the Roche limit and the event horizon radius to avoid being pulled in and destroyed by a black hole's gravitational pull. The actual minimum distance will depend on the specific properties of the black hole and the planet in question."
