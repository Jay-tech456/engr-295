    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L' is the length of the object as measured by the moving observer (in this case, someone on the spaceship), L is the length of the object as measured by the stationary observer (in this case, someone on Earth), v is the relative velocity between the two observers, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nL = 100 meters (length of the spaceship as measured by someone on Earth)\nv = 0.8c (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth)\nc = speed of light\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the length contraction formula:\n\nL' = 100 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL' = 100 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL' = 100 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL' = 100 * 0.6\n\nL' = 60 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by someone on the spaceship is 60 meters."
