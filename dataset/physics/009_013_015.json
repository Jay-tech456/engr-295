    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point. This is due to the difference in focal lengths for rays passing through the outer parts of the lens compared to those passing through the center. To calculate the spherical aberration, we can use the formula:\n\nSA = (n - 1) * (D^4) / (64 * R^3)\n\nwhere SA is the spherical aberration, n is the refractive index of the lens, D is the diameter of the lens, and R is the radius of curvature of the lens.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of curvature (R) of the lens. We can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nSince the lens is a biconvex lens, R1 and R2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, so the formula becomes:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (2/R)\n\nNow, we can solve for R:\n\nR = 2 * (n - 1) * f\n\nR = 2 * (1.5 - 1) * 10 cm\nR = 2 * 0.5 * 10 cm\nR = 10 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius of curvature, we can calculate the spherical aberration:\n\nSA = (1.5 - 1) * (5^4) / (64 * 10^3)\nSA = 0.5 * (625) / (64000)\nSA = 312.5 / 64000\nSA = 0.0048828125 cm\n\nThe spherical aberration in the given convex lens is approximately 0.0049 cm or 49 Âµm."
