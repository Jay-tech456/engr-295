    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of a cubic crystal, we can use the following formula:\n\nα = (1/V) * (dV/dT)\n\nwhere V is the volume of the crystal, and dV/dT is the rate of change of volume with respect to temperature.\n\nWe can relate the volume change to the bulk modulus (B) and the pressure change (dP) using the following equation:\n\ndV/V = -dP/B\n\nSince the pressure change is related to the temperature change (dP = n * C * dT), we can write:\n\ndV/V = -n * C * dT/B\n\nwhere n is the number of atoms in the unit cell, and C is the heat capacity per atom.\n\nNow, we can use the Debye model to estimate the heat capacity (C) at a given temperature (T). The Debye temperature (Θ_D) is given as 310 K. The heat capacity (C) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nC = 9 * N * k * (T/Θ_D)^3 * ∫(x^4 * e^x) / (e^x - 1)^2 dx from 0 to Θ_D/T\n\nwhere N is the number of atoms in the unit cell, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K), and the integral is taken from 0 to Θ_D/T.\n\nFor simplicity, we can use the following approximation for the heat capacity at high temperatures (T >> Θ_D):\n\nC ≈ 3 * N * k\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α):\n\nα = -n * C * dT / (V * B)\n\nWe are given the lattice constant (a) as 5.6 Å, which is equal to 5.6 x 10^(-10) m. The volume of the cubic crystal (V) can be calculated as:\n\nV = a^3 = (5.6 x 10^(-10) m)^3 = 1.75744 x 10^(-28) m³\n\nThe density (ρ) is given as 2.2 g/cm³, which is equal to 2.2 x 10^3 kg/m³. We can calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell (n) using the following equation:\n\nρ = n * m / V\n\nwhere m is the mass of one atom. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nn = ρ * V / m\n\nWe can calculate the mass of one atom (m) using the following equation:\n\nm = M / N_A\n\nwhere M is the molar mass of the crystal, and N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 mol^(-1)). Since we don't have the molar mass of the crystal, we can't calculate the exact value of n. However, we can still express the thermal expansion coefficient (α) in terms of n:\n\nα = -n * C * dT / (V * B)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nα = -n * (3 * N * k) * dT / (V * B)\n\nα = -n * (3 * N * 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) * dT / (1.75744 x 10^(-28) m³ * 107 x 10^9 N/m²)\n\nα = -n * (3 * N * 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) * dT / (1.75744 x 10^(-28) m³ * 107 x 10^9 N/m²)\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of n, we can't calculate the exact value of the thermal expansion coefficient (α). However, we have expressed α in terms of n, which can be used to calculate α once the molar mass of the crystal is known."
