    "message_1": "A cylindrical toroid has a radius of 0.05 meters and consists of 300 turns of wire. The toroid carries a current of 2 Amperes. Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, located at a distance of 0.02 meters from the center of the toroid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) inside a toroid is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nN = 300 turns (number of turns of wire)\nI = 2 A (current)\nr = 0.02 m (distance from the center of the toroid)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 300 * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (2.4 × 10^(-4) Tm²) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 6 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, located at a distance of 0.02 meters from the center of the toroid, is 6 × 10^(-3) Tesla."
