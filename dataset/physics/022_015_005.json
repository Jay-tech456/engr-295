    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are also considered as a potential candidate for dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content.\n\nThe possible mass range of axions is not precisely known, but it is generally believed to be extremely small, in the range of 10^(-6) eV to 10^(-3) eV (micro-electronvolt to milli-electronvolt). This mass range is consistent with the axion being a significant component of the universe's dark matter.\n\nSeveral experiments are being conducted to detect the presence of axions or to set constraints on their properties. Some of the notable experiments include:\n\n1. ADMX (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment): This experiment uses a high-Q microwave cavity within a strong magnetic field to search for axions converting into photons. It is currently the most sensitive axion search experiment and has set the most stringent limits on the axion-photon coupling for a wide range of axion masses.\n\n2. CAST (CERN Axion Solar Telescope): This experiment aims to detect axions produced in the Sun by converting them into X-ray photons using a strong magnetic field. While it has not yet detected axions, it has set important limits on their properties.\n\n3. IAXO (International Axion Observatory): This is a proposed experiment that will significantly improve upon the sensitivity of CAST. It will use a large-scale helioscope with multiple detection lines to search for solar axions.\n\n4. ABRACADABRA (A Broadband/Resonant Approach to Cosmic Axion Detection with an Amplifying B-field Ring Apparatus): This experiment uses a toroidal magnetic field to search for axion-induced magnetic fields. It aims to probe the unexplored mass range of axions and set new limits on their properties.\n\n5. MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment): This experiment aims to detect axions in the mass range of 40 to 400 ÂµeV by using a series of magnetized discs and a mirror to enhance the axion-to-photon conversion probability.\n\nThese experiments, along with other ongoing and proposed projects, are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of axions and their potential role in the universe's dark matter content."
