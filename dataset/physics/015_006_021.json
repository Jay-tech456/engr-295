    "message_2": "To compute the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a spinning black hole, we can use the quadrupole formula. The quadrupole formula is an approximation that describes the gravitational wave emission from a system with time-varying quadrupole moment.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms. One solar mass (M☉) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\nM = 10 M☉ = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe spin parameter (a) is given as 0.8. The spin parameter is a dimensionless quantity, and it is related to the angular momentum (J) of the black hole as follows:\n\na = J / (G * M^2 / c)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s). We can solve for J:\n\nJ = a * (G * M^2 / c)\nJ = 0.8 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)^2 / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s))\nJ ≈ 1.457 x 10^42 kg m^2/s\n\nNow, we can compute the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves. For a spinning black hole, the frequency is approximately given by:\n\nf ≈ c^3 / (G * M * 2 * π)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf ≈ (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg * 2 * π)\nf ≈ 1.327 x 10^3 Hz\n\nNext, we need to find the amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves. The amplitude is related to the mass, distance, and frequency of the waves as follows:\n\nh ≈ (G * M * ω^2) / (c^4 * r)\n\nWhere ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2 * π * f) and r is the distance from the black hole to Earth. We are given that the black hole is 1 billion light-years away, so we need to convert this distance to meters:\n\n1 light-year ≈ 9.461 x 10^15 m\n1 billion light-years ≈ 1 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 m ≈ 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular frequency:\n\nω = 2 * π * f ≈ 2 * π * 1.327 x 10^3 Hz ≈ 8.341 x 10^3 rad/s\n\nFinally, we can compute the amplitude:\n\nh ≈ (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg * (8.341 x 10^3 rad/s)^2) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^4 * 9.461 x 10^24 m)\nh ≈ 1.327 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the spinning black hole is approximately 1.327 x 10^-22, and the frequency is approximately 1.327 x 10^3 Hz."
