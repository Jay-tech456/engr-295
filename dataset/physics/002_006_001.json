    "message_1": "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at standard conditions (298K and 1 atm). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g), and the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for CH4, CO2, and H2O are -50.8 kJ/mol, -393.5 kJ/mol, and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Show all work and include units in your final answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of methane gas at standard conditions, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ(ΔG_f_products) - Σ(ΔG_f_reactants)\n\nwhere ΔG_f is the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each compound.\n\nFor the given reaction, CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g), we have:\n\nΔG = [1 * ΔG_f(CO2) + 2 * ΔG_f(H2O)] - [1 * ΔG_f(CH4) + 2 * ΔG_f(O2)]\n\nSince the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for an element in its standard state is zero, ΔG_f(O2) = 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for CH4, CO2, and H2O:\n\nΔG = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (-50.8 kJ/mol) + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔG = (-393.5 kJ/mol - 483.6 kJ/mol) - (-50.8 kJ/mol)\n\nΔG = (-877.1 kJ/mol) + 50.8 kJ/mol\n\nΔG = -826.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas at standard conditions is -826.3 kJ/mol."
