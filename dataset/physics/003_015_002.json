    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center by considering the contribution from each side of the loop. Since the loop is symmetrical, the magnetic field at the center due to each side will have the same magnitude but different directions. We can find the magnetic field due to one side and then use symmetry to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The length of the side is 0.2 meters. The distance from the center of the side to the center of the loop is half of the side length, which is 0.1 meters. The angle between the position vector r and the current element dl is 90 degrees.\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart Law, the magnetic field due to this side at the center of the loop is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(90) / r²)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the expression to:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl / r²)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire length of the side to find the total magnetic field due to one side:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl / r²)\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl over the length of the side is just the length of the side, which is 0.2 meters:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * 0.2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and r:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (10 A / (0.1 m)²) * 0.2 m\n\nB_side = (10^(-7) Tm²/A) * (10 A / 0.01 m²) * 0.2 m\n\nB_side = 0.2 T\n\nSince there are four sides in the square loop, and the magnetic field at the center due to each side has the same magnitude, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * 0.2 T\n\nB_total = 0.8 T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop can be determined using the right-hand rule. For each side of the loop, the magnetic field at the center will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop and either pointing into or out of the loop. Due to the symmetry of the square loop, the magnetic field at the center will be the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each side. Since the magnetic fields due to opposite sides have the same direction, their contributions will add up, and the total magnetic field at the center will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 0.8 T, and the direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop."
