    "message_1": "A student wants to design a water fountain that sprays water to a maximum height. If the fountain has a nozzle with a diameter of 3 cm and water flows through it at a rate of 2 liters per second, what is the maximum height the water can reach? (Assume that the fountain is operating at sea level under standard atmospheric conditions and neglect any frictional losses.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of mechanical energy principle and Bernoulli's equation. The mechanical energy of the water at the nozzle is converted into potential energy at the maximum height.\n\nBernoulli's equation states that the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume remains constant along a streamline:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * ρ * v1^2 + ρ * g * h1 = P2 + 0.5 * ρ * v2^2 + ρ * g * h2\n\nwhere P is the pressure, ρ is the density of water, v is the velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height.\n\nAt the nozzle (point 1), the height h1 is 0, and at the maximum height (point 2), the velocity v2 is 0. The pressure at both points is atmospheric pressure, so P1 = P2. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0.5 * ρ * v1^2 = ρ * g * h2\n\nWe need to find the velocity (v1) of the water at the nozzle. We are given the flow rate (Q) as 2 liters per second, which is equal to 0.002 m^3/s (since 1 liter = 0.001 m^3). The area (A) of the nozzle can be calculated using the diameter (d) of 3 cm or 0.03 m:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2 = π * (0.03/2)^2 = 7.07 * 10^(-4) m^2\n\nThe velocity (v1) can be found using the flow rate (Q) and the area (A):\n\nv1 = Q / A = 0.002 / 7.07 * 10^(-4) = 2.83 m/s\n\nNow we can find the maximum height (h2) using the simplified Bernoulli's equation:\n\nh2 = (0.5 * ρ * v1^2) / (ρ * g)\n\nThe density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m^3, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.81 m/s^2:\n\nh2 = (0.5 * 1000 * (2.83)^2) / (1000 * 9.81) = 4.01 m\n\nSo the maximum height the water can reach is approximately 4.01 meters."
