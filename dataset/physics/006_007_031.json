    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, the accelerating voltage is used to accelerate electrons through a low-pressure gas, typically mercury or neon. The purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate the quantization of energy levels in atoms by observing inelastic collisions between the accelerated electrons and the gas atoms.\n\nWhen the accelerating voltage is increased, the kinetic energy of the electrons also increases. If the kinetic energy of the electrons is sufficient to excite the gas atoms to a higher energy level, an inelastic collision occurs, and the electrons lose a specific amount of energy corresponding to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the gas atoms.\n\nAs the accelerating voltage increases, the number of electrons with enough kinetic energy to excite the gas atoms also increases. This leads to an increase in the number of inelastic collisions and excited gas atoms. However, it is important to note that the energy levels in atoms are quantized, meaning that the electrons can only excite the gas atoms if their kinetic energy matches the energy difference between the energy levels.\n\nIn the Franck-Hertz experiment, the accelerating voltage is typically increased in small increments. When the voltage reaches a value that corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, a sudden increase in the number of excited gas atoms is observed. As the voltage is further increased, the number of excited gas atoms will increase until the next energy level is reached, and so on.\n\nIn summary, changes in the accelerating voltage in the Franck-Hertz experiment affect the number of electrons excited by controlling the kinetic energy of the electrons. As the accelerating voltage increases, more electrons have sufficient energy to excite the gas atoms, leading to an increase in the number of excited gas atoms. However, this relationship is not linear, as the energy levels in atoms are quantized, and the electrons can only excite the gas atoms if their kinetic energy matches the energy difference between the energy levels."
