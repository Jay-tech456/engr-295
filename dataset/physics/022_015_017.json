    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is related to the violation of the combined charge conjugation and parity symmetries. Later, it was realized that axions could also be a candidate for dark matter, which is the missing mass in the universe.\n\nThe missing mass problem arises from the observation that the visible matter in the universe is not sufficient to account for the gravitational effects observed at the galactic and cosmic scales. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while visible matter only accounts for about 5%. Axions, as weakly interacting and massive particles, could provide the missing mass by existing in large quantities throughout the universe.\n\nSeveral research methods are being employed to detect axions and provide evidence for their existence. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Axion haloscopes: These are experiments that aim to detect axions by converting them into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) is one such experiment that uses a high-Q microwave cavity within a strong magnetic field to search for axion-induced electromagnetic signals.\n\n2. Axion helioscopes: These experiments search for axions produced in the sun. The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is an example of an axion helioscope. It uses a powerful magnet to convert solar axions into X-ray photons, which can then be detected by X-ray detectors.\n\n3. Light-shining-through-walls (LSW) experiments: In these experiments, a laser beam is shone through a strong magnetic field and a barrier. If axions exist, some photons in the laser beam will convert into axions, which can pass through the barrier and then convert back into photons on the other side. The regenerated photons can then be detected.\n\n4. Astrophysical observations: Indirect evidence for axions can be obtained through astrophysical observations, such as the cooling rates of stars. If axions exist, they could be produced in the hot cores of stars and escape, carrying away energy and causing the stars to cool faster than expected.\n\n5. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce axions in particle collisions. These axions could then be detected through their decay products or other signatures.\n\nThese research methods are ongoing, and while no definitive evidence for axions has been found yet, they remain a promising candidate for solving the missing mass problem in the universe."
