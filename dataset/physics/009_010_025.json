    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the image distance (di) using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 15 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nTo find di, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 4*di + 3*di\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\n60 = 7*di\n\nNow, divide by 7 to isolate di:\n\ndi = 60/7\ndi ≈ 8.57 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -8.57/15\nM ≈ -0.571\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is approximately -0.571. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
