    "message_1": "What is the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with masses of 10 solar masses and 15 solar masses, located 1 billion light-years away from Earth, rotating around each other at a frequency of 50 Hz?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the total mass of the binary system, ω is the angular frequency, r is the distance from the system to the observer, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg. Therefore, the total mass of the binary system is:\n\nM = (10 + 15) * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 25 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg ≈ 4.9725 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the frequency of 50 Hz to angular frequency:\n\nω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 50 Hz ≈ 314.16 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to convert the distance from the system to the observer from light-years to meters. One light-year is approximately 9.461 × 10¹⁵ meters. Therefore, the distance is:\n\nr = 1 billion light-years * 9.461 × 10¹⁵ m/light-year ≈ 9.461 × 10²⁴ m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 4.9725 × 10³¹ kg * (314.16 rad/s)² * 9.461 × 10²⁴ m) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴\n\nh ≈ 1.69 × 10⁻²¹\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system is approximately 1.69 × 10⁻²¹."
