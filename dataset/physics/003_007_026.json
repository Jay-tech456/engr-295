    "message_1": "A long, straight metal rod carries a current of 3 A. The rod is placed 4 cm from a point P in free space. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at point P.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a long straight current-carrying conductor, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current in the conductor, and r is the distance from the conductor to point P.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 3 A\nr = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.08 m)\n\nB = 1.5 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is 1.5 × 10⁻⁵ T (tesla).\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the magnetic field. We can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction. Point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the rod), and curl your fingers. The direction in which your fingers curl is the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the direction of the current, we can't give a specific direction for the magnetic field. However, we can say that the magnetic field will be circulating around the rod, perpendicular to the plane formed by the rod and point P."
