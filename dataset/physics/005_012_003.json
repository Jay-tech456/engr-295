    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of an object moving at relativistic speeds (speeds close to the speed of light), we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the object.\n\nIn this case, v = 0.8c. So,\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1)(0.5 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. = 0.6667 x 0.5 x (3 x 10^8)^2\nK.E. ≈ 3 x 10^16 Joules\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the object is approximately 3 x 10^16 Joules."
