    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a phenomenon that occurs near the event horizon of a black hole, where quantum field theory predicts that black holes emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects. This radiation is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who first proposed its existence in 1974. The temperature of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, and it is also affected by the black hole's spin.\n\n1. Mass: As the mass of a black hole increases, the temperature of the Hawking radiation decreases. This is because the event horizon becomes larger, and the curvature of spacetime near the horizon becomes less pronounced. The relationship between the temperature (T) and the mass (M) of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. As the mass M increases, the temperature T decreases, which means that the intensity of the Hawking radiation also decreases.\n\n2. Spin: The spin of a black hole also affects the temperature of the Hawking radiation. A rotating black hole is described by the Kerr metric, which introduces an additional parameter called the angular momentum (J). The temperature of the Hawking radiation for a rotating black hole is given by the formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk_B (1 + √(1 - (J/GM²c)²)))\n\nAs the spin of the black hole increases, the denominator in the formula becomes larger, which means that the temperature of the Hawking radiation decreases. This is because the rotation of the black hole causes the event horizon to become more oblate, which reduces the curvature of spacetime near the horizon.\n\nIn summary, the Hawking radiation from a black hole varies with the change of mass and spin of the black hole. As the mass or spin of the black hole increases, the temperature of the Hawking radiation decreases, leading to a lower intensity of the emitted radiation. This is due to the changes in the curvature of spacetime near the event horizon caused by the mass and spin of the black hole."
