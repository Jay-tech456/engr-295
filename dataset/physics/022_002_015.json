    "message_1": "What percentage of the total mass-energy in the observable universe is comprised of dark matter, and how does this percentage vary across different scales of structure, such as individual galaxies and galaxy clusters?",
    "message_2": "The percentage of the total mass-energy in the observable universe that is comprised of dark matter is approximately 27%. The remaining mass-energy is composed of about 68% dark energy and about 5% ordinary (baryonic) matter. These percentages are derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure, and the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter, however, is not uniform across different scales of structure. In individual galaxies, the percentage of dark matter can vary significantly. For example, in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, dark matter constitutes about 80-90% of the total mass, while in smaller dwarf galaxies, the percentage can be even higher. In elliptical galaxies, the dark matter fraction can be lower, around 50-70% of the total mass.\n\nIn galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, the percentage of dark matter is typically higher than in individual galaxies. Observations suggest that dark matter constitutes about 85-90% of the total mass in galaxy clusters. The remaining mass is primarily in the form of hot intracluster gas (about 10-15%) and a small fraction of stars in galaxies (about 1-2%).\n\nIt is important to note that these percentages can vary depending on the specific galaxy or galaxy cluster being studied, as well as the methods and assumptions used in the analysis. Nonetheless, the overall picture is that dark matter constitutes a significant fraction of the mass-energy content of the universe and plays a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos."
