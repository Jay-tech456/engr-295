    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles, and ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the reactants, H2(g) and O2(g), are both 0 kJ/mol since they are in their elemental form.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for the product, H2O(l), is given as -285.8 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH = [2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × 0 kJ/mol + 1 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH = (-571.6 kJ) - 0\n\nΔH = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change when 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce water at a constant temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm is -571.6 kJ."
