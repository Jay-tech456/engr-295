    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0ħ^2) / (m_e * e^2)\n\nwhere ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m_e is the electron mass, and e is the electron charge.\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is given by:\n\nħ = h / (2π)\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant, which is approximately 6.62607015 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values and calculate the Bohr radius:\n\nε0 = 8.85418782 x 10^-12 F/m\nm_e = 9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg\ne = 1.60217662 x 10^-19 C\nh = 6.62607015 x 10^-34 Js\n\nħ = (6.62607015 x 10^-34 Js) / (2π) ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js\n\nNow, we can calculate the Bohr radius:\n\na0 = (4π * (8.85418782 x 10^-12 F/m) * (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js)^2) / ((9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg) * (1.60217662 x 10^-19 C)^2)\n\na0 ≈ 5.2917721 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.2917721 x 10^-11 meters."
