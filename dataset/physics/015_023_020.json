    "message_2": "The probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) depends on several factors, including the abundance of IMBHs, their mass distribution, the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves, the sensitivity of the detectors, and the observation time.\n\n1. Abundance of IMBHs: The more IMBHs there are in the universe, the higher the probability of detecting gravitational waves from them. However, the exact number and distribution of IMBHs are still uncertain, making it difficult to estimate the detection probability accurately.\n\n2. Mass distribution: The mass of IMBHs typically ranges from 100 to 100,000 solar masses. The mass distribution of IMBHs affects the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves, which in turn affects the detectability.\n\n3. Frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves: Gravitational waves from IMBHs are expected to have lower frequencies and higher amplitudes compared to those from stellar-mass black holes. The frequency and amplitude of the waves depend on the masses and orbital parameters of the merging black holes. Lower frequency waves are more challenging to detect with current ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo, which are more sensitive to higher frequency waves.\n\n4. Sensitivity of detectors: The ability to detect gravitational waves from IMBHs depends on the sensitivity of the detectors. Ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo have limited sensitivity to the lower frequency waves emitted by IMBHs. Future space-based detectors like LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) will have better sensitivity to lower frequency waves, increasing the probability of detecting gravitational waves from IMBHs.\n\n5. Observation time: The longer the observation time, the higher the probability of detecting gravitational waves from IMBHs. As detectors improve and more observation time is accumulated, the chances of detecting these waves increase.\n\nIn summary, the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes depends on several factors, including the abundance and mass distribution of IMBHs, the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves, the sensitivity of the detectors, and the observation time. With the current ground-based detectors, the probability is relatively low, but it is expected to increase with the development of future space-based detectors like LISA."
