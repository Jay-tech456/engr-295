    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the scattering amplitude for electron-electron collision at the lowest order can be calculated using the Feynman diagrams. At the lowest order, there is only one diagram, which is the exchange of a single virtual photon between the two electrons.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for this process, also known as the matrix element M, can be written as:\n\nM = -e^2 u_bar(p3) γ^μ u(p1) D_μν(q) u_bar(p4) γ^ν u(p2)\n\nHere, e is the elementary charge, u(p) and u_bar(p) are the Dirac spinors for the incoming and outgoing electrons, γ^μ are the Dirac gamma matrices, and D_μν(q) is the photon propagator.\n\nThe photon propagator in the Feynman gauge is given by:\n\nD_μν(q) = -g_μν / (q^2 + iε)\n\nwhere q is the momentum of the virtual photon, g_μν is the metric tensor, and ε is a small positive number to ensure the correct analytic properties of the propagator.\n\nThe momentum conservation at each vertex gives:\n\nq = p1 - p3 = p2 - p4\n\nThe matrix element M can be simplified as:\n\nM = -e^2 u_bar(p3) γ^μ u(p1) (-g_μν / (q^2 + iε)) u_bar(p4) γ^ν u(p2)\n\nM = e^2 u_bar(p3) γ^μ u(p1) (g_μν / (q^2 + iε)) u_bar(p4) γ^ν u(p2)\n\nThe scattering amplitude is then given by the square of the matrix element M, which can be used to calculate the differential and total cross-sections for the electron-electron scattering process."
