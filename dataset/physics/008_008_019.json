    "message_2": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), each particle has a supersymmetric partner with the same quantum numbers but differing by a half-integer in spin. The supersymmetric partners of the up and down quarks are called squarks, specifically up-squark and down-squark.\n\nThe exact masses of these supersymmetric particles are not predicted by the MSSM itself, as they depend on the parameters of the model, such as the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms. However, it is generally expected that the masses of the squarks would be significantly larger than the masses of their Standard Model counterparts, the up and down quarks.\n\nFor reference, the masses of the up and down quarks are approximately 2.2 MeV/c² and 4.7 MeV/c², respectively. In contrast, the masses of the squarks are expected to be in the range of hundreds of GeV/c² to a few TeV/c², which is much larger than the quark masses. The exact mass values depend on the specific choice of MSSM parameters and the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking.\n\nThe search for supersymmetric particles, including squarks, is an ongoing effort in experimental particle physics, particularly at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). So far, no direct evidence for supersymmetry has been found, which has led to increasingly stringent lower bounds on the masses of supersymmetric particles."
