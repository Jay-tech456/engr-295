    "message_2": "The stability of planetary systems in the presence of a large central star is affected by several factors. These factors can impact the formation and trajectories of orbiting planets in various ways. Some of the key factors include:\n\n1. Mass of the central star: The mass of the central star plays a crucial role in determining the gravitational force acting on the orbiting planets. A more massive star will exert a stronger gravitational pull, which can affect the stability of the planetary orbits. In some cases, the gravitational force can be strong enough to cause the planets to migrate inward or outward, altering their trajectories.\n\n2. Distance between the star and planets: The distance between the central star and the orbiting planets is another important factor. Planets that are closer to the star are more likely to experience stronger gravitational forces, which can lead to more unstable orbits. Additionally, the closer a planet is to the star, the more likely it is to be affected by the star's radiation and stellar winds, which can erode planetary atmospheres and impact their habitability.\n\n3. Orbital resonance: Orbital resonance occurs when two or more planets have orbital periods that are in a simple integer ratio. This can lead to periodic gravitational interactions between the planets, which can either stabilize or destabilize their orbits. In some cases, these resonances can cause planets to be ejected from the system or collide with one another.\n\n4. Eccentricity of planetary orbits: The eccentricity of a planet's orbit, or how elliptical it is, can also impact the stability of a planetary system. Planets with highly eccentric orbits can experience significant variations in their distance from the central star, leading to changes in gravitational forces and potential interactions with other planets. This can result in unstable orbits and even planetary ejections.\n\n5. Inclination of planetary orbits: The inclination of a planet's orbit, or the angle between its orbital plane and the plane of the central star's equator, can also affect the stability of a planetary system. Planets with high inclinations are more likely to experience gravitational interactions with other planets, which can lead to changes in their orbits and potential instability.\n\n6. Presence of other celestial bodies: The presence of other celestial bodies, such as additional stars or massive planets, can also impact the stability of a planetary system. These bodies can introduce additional gravitational forces and perturbations, which can alter the orbits of planets and potentially lead to instability.\n\n7. Age of the system: The age of the planetary system can also play a role in its stability. Over time, gravitational interactions between planets can cause their orbits to change, potentially leading to instability. Additionally, as a star ages, it can undergo changes in its mass and radius, which can impact the gravitational forces acting on the planets and their orbits.\n\nIn summary, the stability of planetary systems in the presence of a large central star is influenced by a variety of factors, including the mass of the star, the distance between the star and planets, orbital resonance, eccentricity and inclination of planetary orbits, the presence of other celestial bodies, and the age of the system. These factors can impact the formation and trajectories of orbiting planets, potentially leading to unstable orbits, planetary migration, and even ejections or collisions."
