    "message_2": "The merger of two non-spinning black holes with masses 10 and 15 times that of the sun can be divided into three phases: inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The gravitational wave signals generated during these phases can be described as follows:\n\n1. Inspiral: During the inspiral phase, the two black holes orbit each other, gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves. The gravitational wave signal during this phase can be described by the frequency and amplitude of the waves. The frequency increases as the black holes get closer, and the amplitude increases as well. The waveform can be modeled using the post-Newtonian approximation or numerical relativity simulations.\n\n2. Merger: When the black holes are close enough, they merge into a single black hole. The gravitational wave signal during this phase is characterized by a peak in both frequency and amplitude. This is the most energetic part of the process, and the waveform can be modeled using numerical relativity simulations.\n\n3. Ringdown: After the merger, the newly formed black hole settles down to a stable state, emitting gravitational waves as it does so. The waveform during this phase is characterized by a series of damped oscillations, called quasinormal modes. These modes can be calculated using black hole perturbation theory.\n\nThe expected magnitude of these signals at Earth-based gravitational wave detectors like LIGO depends on the distance to the source and the sensitivity of the detectors. The strain amplitude of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * c^(-2)) / (D * r)\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system (in this case, 25 times the mass of the sun), c is the speed of light, D is the distance to the source, and r is the separation between the black holes.\n\nThe sensitivity of LIGO depends on the frequency of the gravitational waves, with the best sensitivity in the range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. The strain amplitude of the gravitational waves from the merger of two non-spinning black holes with masses 10 and 15 times that of the sun would be detectable by LIGO if the source is within its sensitive range, which is up to several hundred megaparsecs (1 parsec â‰ˆ 3.26 light-years) away."
