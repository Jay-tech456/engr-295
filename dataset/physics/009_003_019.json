    "message_1": "A ray of light is traveling through an acrylic block. The angle of incidence of the ray is 40° with respect to the normal. Calculate the critical angle for total internal reflection between acrylic and air.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle for total internal reflection between acrylic and air, we need to know the refractive indices of both materials. The refractive index of air is approximately 1, and the refractive index of acrylic is approximately 1.49.\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when the angle of refraction is 90°. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle (θc) for total internal reflection:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two materials, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1.49 (acrylic), n2 = 1 (air), and θ2 = 90°. We can rearrange Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle θ1:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(n2 * sin(θ2) / n1)\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 * sin(90°) / 1.49)\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.49)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.8°\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection between acrylic and air is approximately 41.8°."
