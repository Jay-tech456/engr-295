    "message_1": "A ray of light traveling through air enters a medium with an index of refraction of 1.4. If the angle of incidence is 35 degrees, what is the angle of refraction according to Snell's Law?",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the index of refraction and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the index of refraction and angle of refraction in the second medium.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (since the index of refraction of air is approximately 1), θ1 = 35 degrees, and n2 = 1.4. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(35°) = 1.4 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(35°) = 1.4 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(35°) / 1.4 = sin(θ2)\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(35°) / 1.4)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ2 ≈ 22.6 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 22.6 degrees."
