    "message_1": "What is the maximum frequency of a gravitational wave that can be emitted from a binary system of two black holes each with a mass of 30 solar masses and separated by a distance of 10 times the mass of the sun?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum frequency of a gravitational wave emitted from a binary system of two black holes, we can use the formula for the orbital frequency of a binary system:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n\nwhere f_orbital is the orbital frequency, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and a is the separation between them.\n\nThe maximum frequency of a gravitational wave is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_max = 2 * f_orbital\n\nGiven the masses of the black holes (M1 = M2 = 30 solar masses) and the separation (a = 10 solar masses), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * (30 + 30) / (10 * G)^3)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nM1 = M2 = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\na = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * (5.967 x 10^31 + 5.967 x 10^31) / (1.989 x 10^31 * G)^3)\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * (1.1934 x 10^32) / (7.943 x 10^93 * G^3))\n\nThe gravitational constant G ≈ 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. We can now plug this value into the formula:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * π)) * √((6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.1934 x 10^32) / (7.943 x 10^93 * (6.674 x 10^-11)^3))\n\nf_orbital ≈ 1.183 x 10^-2 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the maximum frequency of the gravitational wave:\n\nf_max = 2 * f_orbital\nf_max ≈ 2 * 1.183 x 10^-2 Hz\nf_max ≈ 2.366 x 10^-2 Hz\n\nSo, the maximum frequency of a gravitational wave that can be emitted from this binary system of two black holes is approximately 2.366 x 10^-2 Hz."
