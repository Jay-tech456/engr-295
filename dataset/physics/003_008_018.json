    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of copper (0.1 m x 0.2 m) is carrying a current of 5 A in the x-direction. Calculate the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 0.1m from the sheet and in the y-axis direction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since we have a rectangular sheet carrying a current, we can simplify the problem by considering the sheet as an infinite current sheet. This is because the dimensions of the sheet are much larger than the distance from the point P.\n\nFor an infinite current sheet, the magnetic field is given by the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * I / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the sheet.\n\nIn this case, I = 5 A and d = 0.1 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm) * (5) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) T) * (5)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 10 μT\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is 10 μT in the y-axis direction."
