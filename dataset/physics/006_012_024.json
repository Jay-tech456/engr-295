    "message_2": "To calculate the ionization energy of a helium atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom:\n\nE = -13.6 * Z^2 / n^2 eV\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (Z = 2 for helium), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state).\n\nFor helium, the ionization energy corresponds to the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state (n = 1) to infinity (n = ∞). Therefore, we can calculate the ionization energy as follows:\n\nE_ionization = E_infinity - E_ground\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the ground state (n = 1):\n\nE_ground = -13.6 * (2^2) / 1^2 = -13.6 * 4 = -54.4 eV\n\nSince the energy at infinity (n = ∞) is 0 eV, the ionization energy is:\n\nE_ionization = 0 - (-54.4) = 54.4 eV\n\nNow, let's convert the ionization energy from electron volts to joules. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J:\n\nE_ionization (J) = 54.4 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV = 8.71 × 10^(-18) J\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a helium atom is 54.4 eV or 8.71 × 10^(-18) J."
