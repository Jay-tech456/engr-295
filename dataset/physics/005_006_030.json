    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (GM/c^2) * (1/r1 - 1/r2)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the Earth, c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), r1 is the initial distance from the center of the Earth (the Earth's radius), and r2 is the final distance from the center of the Earth (the Earth's radius plus the height above the surface).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n- Earth's radius (r1): 6371 km = 6,371,000 m\n- Height above the surface: 1000 km = 1,000,000 m\n\nNow, we can calculate r2:\nr2 = r1 + height above the surface = 6,371,000 m + 1,000,000 m = 7,371,000 m\n\nNext, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.97 × 10^24 kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2 * (1/6,371,000 m - 1/7,371,000 m)\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 4.463 × 10^-10\n\nThe gravitational redshift experienced by a photon emitted from the surface of the Earth when it travels to a distance of 1000 kilometers above the surface is approximately 4.463 × 10^-10. This is a dimensionless value, representing the fractional change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift."
