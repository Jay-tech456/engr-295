    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (water and air, respectively), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1.33 (refractive index of water) and n2 = 1.00 (refractive index of air). We can rearrange Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle of incidence (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nSince θ2 = 90 degrees, sin(θ2) = 1. Therefore:\n\nsin(θ1) = (1.00 * 1) / 1.33\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.7519\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle of incidence by taking the inverse sine of this value:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.7519)\nθ1 ≈ 48.6 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for total internal reflection to occur when light travels from water to air is approximately 48.6 degrees."
