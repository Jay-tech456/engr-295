    "message_2": "The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes phase transitions in magnetic systems. In a two-dimensional lattice, the critical exponents of the Ising model during a second-order phase transition are as follows:\n\n1. α: The specific heat exponent\nα = 0\n\n2. β: The order parameter (magnetization) exponent\nβ = 1/8\n\n3. γ: The susceptibility exponent\nγ = 7/4\n\n4. ν: The correlation length exponent\nν = 1\n\n5. η: The correlation function exponent\nη = 1/4\n\n6. δ: The critical isotherm exponent\nδ = 15\n\nThese critical exponents characterize the behavior of the system near the critical point, where the phase transition occurs. They describe how various quantities, such as specific heat, magnetization, susceptibility, and correlation length, diverge or vanish as the system approaches the critical point.\n\nThe universality class of a phase transition refers to the fact that systems with different microscopic details can exhibit the same macroscopic behavior near the critical point. This means that the critical exponents are the same for all systems within the same universality class. In the case of the two-dimensional Ising model, the critical exponents are shared by other two-dimensional systems with short-range interactions and a scalar order parameter, such as the XY model and the Potts model. This universality is a consequence of the fact that the long-range behavior near the critical point is determined by the symmetries and dimensionality of the system, rather than the specific details of the interactions."
