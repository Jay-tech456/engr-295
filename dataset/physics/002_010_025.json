    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of vaporization of water at 100째C, we can use the given molar heat of vaporization and convert it to a mass basis using the molar mass of water.\n\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is:\nM = 2 * (mass of hydrogen) + (mass of oxygen)\nM = 2 * 1.008 g/mol (hydrogen) + 16.00 g/mol (oxygen)\nM = 2.016 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol\nM = 18.016 g/mol\n\nNow, we can convert the molar heat of vaporization to a mass basis using the molar mass of water:\n\nLatent heat of vaporization (L) = (molar heat of vaporization) / (molar mass of water)\nL = (40.7 kJ/mol) / (18.016 g/mol)\n\nTo convert kJ to J, we multiply by 1000:\n\nL = (40.7 * 1000 J/mol) / (18.016 g/mol)\nL = 40700 J/mol / 18.016 g/mol\nL = 2260 J/g\n\nSo, the latent heat of vaporization of water at 100째C is approximately 2260 J/g."
