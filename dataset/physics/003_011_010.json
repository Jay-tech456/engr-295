    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the disc is circular and carries a steady current, we can assume that the current is uniformly distributed along the circumference. Let's consider a small current element on the circumference of the disc at an angle θ and radius ρ (ρ varies from 0 to R). The length of this small current element is dl = ρdθ.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to point P is given by:\n\nr = √(ρ² + z²)\n\nNow, we need to find the cross product dl x r. Since dl and r are in the same plane (the plane of the disc), the cross product will be perpendicular to this plane, i.e., along the axis of the disc. The magnitude of the cross product is given by:\n\n|dl x r| = dl * r * sin(φ)\n\nwhere φ is the angle between dl and r. In this case, φ = 90°, so sin(φ) = 1. Therefore,\n\n|dl x r| = ρdθ * √(ρ² + z²)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * ρdθ * √(ρ² + z²)) / (ρ² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate this expression over the entire disc. Since the current is uniformly distributed, we can integrate over the angle θ from 0 to 2π and over the radius ρ from 0 to R:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = ∫(∫(dB dρ) dθ)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(∫(ρdρ dθ) / (ρ² + z²)^(3/2), ρ = 0 to R, θ = 0 to 2π)\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to ρ:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(2π * [(-z) / (ρ² + z²)^(1/2)] from ρ = 0 to R, θ = 0 to 2π)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(2π * [(-z) / (R² + z²)^(1/2) - (-z) / (z²)^(1/2)], θ = 0 to 2π)\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to θ:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * 2π * [(-z) / (R² + z²)^(1/2) - (-z) / (z²)^(1/2)] * (2π)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * [(z / √(z²)) - (z / √(R² + z²))]\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * [1 - (z / √(R² + z²))]\n\nThis is the magnetic field at point P on the axis of the circular disc at a distance z from its center."
