    "message_2": "String theory proposes to solve the information paradox of black holes by using the holographic principle and the concept of entanglement entropy. The information paradox arises from the fact that, according to classical general relativity, black holes destroy information when they evaporate through Hawking radiation. This contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics, which state that information must be conserved.\n\nThe holographic principle suggests that the information about a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary, like a hologram. In the context of black holes, this principle implies that the information about the matter that falls into a black hole is not lost but rather encoded on the event horizon, which is the boundary of the black hole.\n\nString theory provides a framework for understanding the holographic principle through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This correspondence is a theoretical duality that relates a gravitational theory in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to a conformal field theory (CFT) on the boundary of that space. In the context of black holes, this correspondence allows us to study the information content of a black hole by examining the behavior of the corresponding CFT on the boundary.\n\nEntanglement entropy plays a crucial role in understanding how the information paradox is resolved in string theory. Entanglement entropy is a measure of the amount of entanglement between two subsystems in a quantum system. When matter falls into a black hole, the entanglement entropy between the infalling matter and the radiation outside the black hole increases. According to the holographic principle, this increase in entanglement entropy is related to the growth of the black hole's event horizon.\n\nAs the black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, the entanglement entropy between the radiation and the black hole decreases. Eventually, the black hole completely evaporates, and the entanglement entropy goes to zero. This process suggests that the information about the infalling matter is not lost but rather transferred to the Hawking radiation through quantum entanglement.\n\nIn summary, string theory proposes to solve the information paradox of black holes by using the holographic principle and entanglement entropy. The holographic principle allows us to study the information content of a black hole by examining the behavior of a corresponding conformal field theory on the boundary. Entanglement entropy provides a way to understand how the information about the infalling matter is transferred to the Hawking radiation, preserving the information and resolving the paradox."
