    "message_2": "In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the calculation of the renormalization constant plays a crucial role in predicting physical observables, such as the mass and charge of elementary particles. The reason for this is that the perturbation theory used in QFT often leads to divergent integrals, which means that the calculated values for physical observables become infinite. This is clearly unphysical, as we know that particles have finite mass and charge.\n\nRenormalization is a technique used to deal with these divergences by introducing a set of constants, called renormalization constants, which absorb the infinities and allow us to obtain finite values for the physical observables. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Introduce a regularization scheme: This is a mathematical trick used to make the divergent integrals finite temporarily. One common method is to introduce a momentum cutoff, which limits the range of momenta considered in the integrals.\n\n2. Calculate the renormalization constants: Using the regularized integrals, we can calculate the renormalization constants, which are typically denoted as Z-factors (e.g., Z_m for mass and Z_e for charge). These constants are determined by comparing the regularized theory with the physical (measurable) quantities.\n\n3. Renormalize the theory: We then redefine the parameters of the theory, such as the mass and charge, in terms of the renormalization constants. This is done by multiplying the original parameters by the corresponding Z-factors. The redefined parameters are called renormalized parameters (e.g., m_R for renormalized mass and e_R for renormalized charge).\n\n4. Remove the regularization: Finally, we remove the regularization scheme, which allows the divergences to reappear. However, due to the renormalization, these divergences are now absorbed by the renormalization constants, and the renormalized parameters remain finite.\n\nThe renormalized parameters are the ones that can be compared to experimental measurements. Thus, the calculation of the renormalization constants is essential for making accurate predictions of physical observables in QFT. The success of this approach is demonstrated by the remarkable agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results in the case of the electron's magnetic moment, for example."
