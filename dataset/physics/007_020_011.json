    "message_1": "A nuclear physics student wants to measure the activity of a radioactive source using a Geiger-Muller (GM) counter. Given the following information: the background count rate is 12 counts per minute, the efficiency of the GM counter is 26%, and the half-life of the radioactive source is 30 minutes. How long does the student need to count in order to determine the activity of the source with a relative uncertainty of 10%?",
    "message_2": "To determine the activity of the radioactive source with a relative uncertainty of 10%, we need to consider the statistical nature of radioactive decay and the counting process. The uncertainty in the number of counts is given by the square root of the total counts. The relative uncertainty is the ratio of the uncertainty to the total counts.\n\nLet N be the number of counts from the radioactive source, B be the number of background counts, and t be the counting time in minutes. The total counts are N + B, and the uncertainty is sqrt(N + B). The relative uncertainty is given by:\n\nRelative Uncertainty = sqrt(N + B) / (N + B)\n\nWe want the relative uncertainty to be 10%, or 0.1:\n\n0.1 = sqrt(N + B) / (N + B)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.01 (N + B) = N + B\n\nNow, we know that the background count rate is 12 counts per minute, so B = 12t. The efficiency of the GM counter is 26%, so the actual number of counts from the radioactive source is N = 0.26A*t, where A is the activity of the source.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation:\n\n0.01 (0.26A*t + 12t) = 0.26A*t + 12t\n\nDividing both sides by t:\n\n0.01 (0.26A + 12) = 0.26A + 12\n\nNow, we can solve for A:\n\n0.0026A + 0.12 = 0.26A\n\n0.2574A = 0.12\n\nA = 0.12 / 0.2574 ≈ 0.466 counts per minute\n\nNow that we have the activity of the source, we can find the counting time t. Using the expression for N:\n\nN = 0.26A*t\n\nt = N / (0.26A)\n\nWe know that N + B = 100 counts (since the relative uncertainty is 10%, and 100 counts give a 10% uncertainty):\n\n0.26A*t + 12t = 100\n\nSubstituting A:\n\n0.26(0.466)*t + 12t = 100\n\nt ≈ 3.39 minutes\n\nSo, the student needs to count for approximately 3.39 minutes to determine the activity of the source with a relative uncertainty of 10%."
