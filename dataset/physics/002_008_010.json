After a while, both the copper and water reach a temperature of 30°C. Calculate the specific heat capacity of copper.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of energy principle, which states that the heat gained by the water must be equal to the heat lost by the copper. We can express this mathematically as:\n\nQ_water = Q_copper\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy. The formula for heat energy is:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. \n\nFor water, we have:\nm_water = 500 g\nc_water = 4.18 J/(g·°C) (specific heat capacity of water)\nΔT_water = 30°C - 25°C = 5°C\n\nFor copper, we have:\nm_copper = 200 g\nΔT_copper = 100°C - 30°C = 70°C\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\nm_water * c_water * ΔT_water = m_copper * c_copper * ΔT_copper\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n500 g * 4.18 J/(g·°C) * 5°C = 200 g * c_copper * 70°C\n\nSolving for c_copper:\n\nc_copper = (500 g * 4.18 J/(g·°C) * 5°C) / (200 g * 70°C)\n\nc_copper ≈ 0.386 J/(g·°C)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of copper is approximately 0.386 J/(g·°C)."
