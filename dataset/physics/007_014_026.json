    "message_2": "The maximum number of protons and neutrons that can be present in a stable nucleus is determined by the concept of the \"nuclear drip line.\" The nuclear drip line is the boundary that delimits the zone beyond which atomic nuclei decay by the emission of protons or neutrons. The exact location of the drip lines is not yet known for all elements, but experimental data and theoretical models can provide estimates.\n\nThe heaviest stable nucleus known is lead-208 (208Pb), which has 82 protons and 126 neutrons. However, there are heavier nuclei that have longer half-lives, such as bismuth-209 (209Bi) with 83 protons and 126 neutrons, but they are considered to be unstable due to their eventual decay via alpha decay or other processes.\n\nThe stability of a nucleus is determined by the balance between the attractive strong nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons together and the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons. As the number of protons increases, the repulsive force becomes stronger, making it more difficult for the strong nuclear force to hold the nucleus together. Neutrons can help stabilize the nucleus by providing additional attractive strong force without adding to the repulsive electromagnetic force.\n\nThe heaviest element that has been synthesized so far is element 118, oganesson (Og), with 118 protons and 176 neutrons. However, its half-life is extremely short, on the order of milliseconds, indicating that it is far from stable.\n\nBased on the current understanding of nuclear structure, the maximum number of protons and neutrons that can be present in a stable nucleus is approximately 82 protons and 126 neutrons, as found in lead-208. However, ongoing research in nuclear physics may reveal new insights into the stability of heavier nuclei and the location of the nuclear drip lines."
