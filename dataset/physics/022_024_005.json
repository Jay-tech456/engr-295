    "message_2": "As a physicist, I can provide you with some general information about dark scalars and dark fermions, but please note that the exact temperature and mass range for these particles are still under active research and not yet definitively established.\n\nDark scalars and dark fermions are hypothetical particles that could potentially explain the observed dark matter density in our universe. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our current detection methods. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nDark scalars are hypothetical scalar particles, meaning they have no spin, while dark fermions are hypothetical fermionic particles, meaning they have half-integer spin. Both types of particles are considered to be part of the broader class of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are potential dark matter candidates.\n\nThe mass range of dark scalars and dark fermions is typically expected to be in the range of a few GeV (giga-electron volts) to a few TeV (tera-electron volts). This mass range is based on theoretical considerations and experimental constraints from particle physics experiments, such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nThe temperature of these particles is related to the temperature of the universe when they decoupled from the thermal bath, which is when they stopped interacting with other particles and started behaving as dark matter. This decoupling temperature is typically in the range of a few MeV (mega-electron volts) to a few GeV. The exact temperature depends on the specific model and the properties of the dark scalars or dark fermions being considered.\n\nIt is important to note that these values are not definitive and are subject to change as new experimental data and theoretical developments emerge. The search for dark matter candidates, including dark scalars and dark fermions, is an ongoing area of research in both theoretical and experimental physics."
