Find the thickness of the wedge, the deviation produced by the wedge, and the lateral displacement of the emergent ray. (Assume the refractive index of air is 1)",
    "message_2": "Given the refractive index of glass (μg) and air (μa), we can find the refractive index of the glass-air interface. Since μa = 1, we have:\n\nμg = 1 + 0.005 = 1.005\n\nNow, let's find the angle of incidence (i) and the angle of refraction (r) using Snell's Law:\n\nμa * sin(i) = μg * sin(r)\n\nSince the angle of the wedge is 4°, we can assume that the angle of incidence (i) is also 4°. Let's find the angle of refraction (r):\n\nsin(r) = (μa * sin(i)) / μg\nsin(r) = (1 * sin(4°)) / 1.005\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nsin(r) ≈ 0.0698\n\nNow, we can find the angle of refraction (r):\n\nr ≈ arcsin(0.0698) ≈ 4.01°\n\nNext, we can find the angle between the incident and refracted rays inside the wedge (θ):\n\nθ = i - r ≈ 4° - 4.01° ≈ -0.01°\n\nNow, let's find the thickness of the wedge (t). We know that the path difference between the two rays inside the wedge is equal to the wavelength of the light (λ) divided by 2:\n\nPath difference = λ / 2 = 600 nm / 2 = 300 nm\n\nThe path difference is also equal to the product of the thickness of the wedge (t) and the angle θ:\n\nPath difference = t * θ\n\nNow, we can find the thickness of the wedge (t):\n\nt = Path difference / θ ≈ 300 nm / (-0.01°)\n\nConverting the angle to radians:\n\nt ≈ 300 nm / (-0.01 * (π / 180))\nt ≈ -5430 nm\n\nSince the thickness cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nt ≈ 5430 nm\n\nNow, let's find the deviation produced by the wedge (δ). The deviation is the difference between the angle of incidence (i) and the angle of emergence (e):\n\nδ = i - e\n\nSince the angle of refraction (r) is approximately equal to the angle of incidence (i), the angle of emergence (e) is also approximately equal to the angle of incidence (i):\n\ne ≈ i ≈ 4°\n\nTherefore, the deviation produced by the wedge (δ) is approximately:\n\nδ ≈ 4° - 4° ≈ 0°\n\nFinally, let's find the lateral displacement of the emergent ray (L). The lateral displacement is the product of the thickness of the wedge (t) and the angle θ:\n\nL = t * θ ≈ 5430 nm * (-0.01°)\n\nConverting the angle to radians:\n\nL ≈ 5430 nm * (-0.01 * (π / 180))\nL ≈ -95 nm\n\nSince the lateral displacement cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nL ≈ 95 nm\n\nIn summary, the thickness of the wedge is approximately 5430 nm, the deviation produced by the wedge is approximately 0°, and the lateral displacement of the emergent ray is approximately 95 nm."
