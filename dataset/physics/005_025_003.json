    "message_2": "The relativistic energy-momentum relation is given by the equation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle, m is its mass, p is its momentum, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nTo find the energy E, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nE = sqrt((mc²)² + (pc)²)"
