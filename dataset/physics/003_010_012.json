    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nWhere B is the magnetic field, r is the distance from the center of the wire, and I is the current.\n\nWe are given the radius of the wire (0.05 meters), the current (5 amperes), and the distance from the center of the wire (0.1 meters). The permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB * 2π(0.1) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 5\n\nB * 0.2π = 20π × 10^(-7)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7)) / 0.2π\n\nB ≈ 10 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 1 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the wire is approximately 1 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
