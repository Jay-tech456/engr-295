The effective focal length\n2. The angular magnification of the telescope\n3. The chromatic aberration of the lens system at a wavelength of 550 nm.",
    "message_2": "1. The effective focal length:\nThe effective focal length (EFL) of a telescope is the distance from the objective lens to the image formed by the objective lens. In this case, the EFL is equal to the focal length of the objective lens, which is 80 cm.\n\n2. The angular magnification of the telescope:\nThe angular magnification (M) of a telescope is the ratio of the focal length of the objective lens (F_obj) to the focal length of the eyepiece (F_eye). In this case, the angular magnification can be calculated as follows:\n\nM = F_obj / F_eye\nM = 80 cm / 10 cm\nM = 8\n\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is 8.\n\n3. The chromatic aberration of the lens system at a wavelength of 550 nm:\nChromatic aberration occurs when a lens fails to focus all colors of light at the same point. It is difficult to calculate the exact chromatic aberration without knowing the refractive index of the lens material and its dispersion properties. However, we can estimate the chromatic aberration using the Abbe number (V) and the focal length (F) of the lens.\n\nChromatic aberration (CA) = (F * Δλ) / V\n\nWhere Δλ is the difference in wavelengths of light that the lens can focus (in this case, we are considering a wavelength of 550 nm), and V is the Abbe number of the lens material. The Abbe number is a measure of the material's dispersion, with higher values indicating lower dispersion.\n\nWithout knowing the Abbe number of the lens material, we cannot calculate the exact chromatic aberration. However, we can say that the chromatic aberration will be inversely proportional to the Abbe number of the lens material."
