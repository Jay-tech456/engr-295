    "message_1": "What is the distance between an object and a concave mirror that produces an image 3 times bigger than the object, when the object is placed 10 cm from the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nWe are also given the magnification (M) formula for a concave mirror:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nSince the image is 3 times bigger than the object, the magnification is -3 (negative sign indicates that the image is inverted).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the magnification formula as:\n\nv = -3u\n\nWe are given that the object is placed 10 cm from the mirror, so u = 10 cm. Therefore:\n\nv = -3(10) = -30 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values of u and v into the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/(-30) + 1/(10)\n\n1/f = -1/30 + 1/10\n\n1/f = (-1 + 3)/30\n\n1/f = 2/30\n\nf = 30/2\n\nf = 15 cm\n\nNow that we have the focal length, we can find the new object distance (u') when the image is 3 times bigger. We can use the magnification formula again:\n\nM = -v'/u'\n\n-3 = -v'/u'\n\nSince the magnification is the same, we can assume that the image distance (v') will also be the same (-30 cm). Therefore:\n\n-3 = 30/u'\n\nu' = 30/-3\n\nu' = -10 cm\n\nHowever, since the distance cannot be negative, we made an error in our assumption that the image distance would remain the same. In this case, we need to reconsider the problem.\n\nLet's go back to the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\n-3 = -v'/10\n\nv' = 30 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values of u and v' into the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/(10) + 1/(30)\n\n1/15 = 1/10 + 1/30\n\n1/15 = (3 + 1)/30\n\n1/15 = 4/30\n\n15 = 30/4\n\nThis result contradicts our previously calculated focal length (15 cm). This indicates that the problem, as stated, is not possible for a concave mirror. The image cannot be 3 times bigger than the object when the object is placed 10 cm from the mirror."
