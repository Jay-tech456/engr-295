    "message_1": "What is the maximum dose of ionizing radiation a human body can withstand from cosmic rays before significant health risks arise? How does this compare to the levels of cosmic radiation exposure experienced by astronauts on a typical space mission? Looking at the current spacecraft shielding technology, can we design a shielding to reduce the cosmic radiation dose received by the astronauts to the safe limit during long-duration space missions?",
    "message_2": "The maximum dose of ionizing radiation a human body can withstand from cosmic rays before significant health risks arise is generally considered to be around 1 Sievert (Sv) over a lifetime. Exposure to ionizing radiation above this level increases the risk of cancer and other radiation-related health issues.\n\nAstronauts on a typical space mission, such as those on the International Space Station (ISS), are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation than people on Earth. They receive an average dose of about 0.1 to 0.2 millisieverts (mSv) per day, which is about 36 to 72 mSv per year. This is still below the 1 Sv lifetime limit, but the risk increases with the duration of the mission and the number of missions an astronaut participates in.\n\nCurrent spacecraft shielding technology can reduce the cosmic radiation dose received by astronauts, but it is not yet sufficient to completely protect them during long-duration space missions, such as a mission to Mars. The main challenge is that cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles that can penetrate most materials, and shielding against them requires a combination of passive and active shielding techniques.\n\nPassive shielding involves using materials like aluminum, polyethylene, or other composites to absorb or deflect the incoming radiation. However, this approach has limitations, as it can add significant weight to the spacecraft and may not be effective against all types of cosmic rays.\n\nActive shielding, on the other hand, involves using magnetic or electrostatic fields to deflect incoming radiation. This approach is more effective against high-energy particles but requires significant power and advanced technology to implement.\n\nIn conclusion, while current spacecraft shielding technology can reduce the cosmic radiation dose received by astronauts, it is not yet sufficient to completely protect them during long-duration space missions. Further research and development are needed to improve shielding techniques and minimize the health risks associated with cosmic radiation exposure."
