    "message_2": "A low-mass star like the Sun goes through several stages during its lifetime, ultimately ending as a white dwarf. Here's a brief overview of the stages and how its nuclear reactions contribute to the abundance of elements in the universe:\n\n1. **Nebula and Protostar**: The Sun's life began in a molecular cloud, a large region of gas and dust in space. Gravity caused the cloud to collapse, forming a protostar. At this stage, the star is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.\n\n2. **Main Sequence**: As the protostar continues to contract, its core temperature and pressure increase until nuclear fusion begins. The Sun is currently in this stage, which lasts for about 10 billion years. During this time, hydrogen nuclei in the core fuse to form helium through the proton-proton chain reaction. This process releases energy in the form of light and heat, which is the source of the Sun's energy.\n\n3. **Red Giant**: Once the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the core contracts and heats up, while the outer layers expand. The Sun will become a red giant, with its outer layers reaching out to the orbit of Mars. In the core, helium nuclei will start fusing into carbon and oxygen through the triple-alpha process. The energy released from this process causes the outer layers to expand even further.\n\n4. **Planetary Nebula and White Dwarf**: Towards the end of the red giant phase, the outer layers of the Sun will be expelled into space, forming a planetary nebula. The core, now composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, will be left behind as a white dwarf. The white dwarf will gradually cool and fade over billions of years, eventually becoming a black dwarf (a theoretical stage, as the universe is not old enough for any white dwarfs to have cooled to this point).\n\nThroughout these stages, the Sun's nuclear reactions contribute to the abundance of elements in the universe. The fusion of hydrogen into helium during the main sequence stage increases the amount of helium in the universe. The fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen during the red giant phase adds to the abundance of these heavier elements. The planetary nebula that forms when the outer layers are expelled also enriches the interstellar medium with heavier elements, which can then be incorporated into new stars and planets.\n\nIn summary, a low-mass star like the Sun will eventually evolve into a white dwarf, and its nuclear reactions contribute to the abundance of elements in the universe by producing helium, carbon, and oxygen, as well as enriching the interstellar medium with heavier elements."
