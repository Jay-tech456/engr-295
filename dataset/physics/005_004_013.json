    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy and momentum of the spaceship, we'll first need to find its rest mass (m0) and then use the relativistic equations for kinetic energy and momentum.\n\n1. Find the rest mass (m0):\nThe relativistic mass (m) is related to the rest mass (m0) by the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship and c is the speed of light. We are given m = 3500 kg and v = 0.9c. We can rearrange the equation to solve for m0:\n\nm0 = m * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nm0 = 3500 * sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nm0 = 3500 * sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nm0 = 3500 * sqrt(0.19)\nm0 ≈ 3500 * 0.4359\nm0 ≈ 1525.65 kg\n\n2. Calculate the kinetic energy (K):\nThe relativistic kinetic energy is given by the equation:\n\nK = (m - m0) * c^2\n\nK = (3500 - 1525.65) * c^2\nK ≈ 1974.35 * c^2\n\nSince c^2 = (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2 = 9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2, we have:\n\nK ≈ 1974.35 * (9 * 10^16)\nK ≈ 1.77692 * 10^20 J\n\n3. Calculate the momentum (p):\nThe relativistic momentum is given by the equation:\n\np = m * v\n\np = 3500 * 0.9c\np ≈ 3150 * c\n\nSince c = 3 * 10^8 m/s, we have:\n\np ≈ 3150 * (3 * 10^8)\np ≈ 9.45 * 10^11 kg m/s\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.77692 * 10^20 Joules, and its momentum is approximately 9.45 * 10^11 kg m/s."
