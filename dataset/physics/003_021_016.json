    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil with 100 turns and a secondary coil with 500 turns. The primary coil is connected to a 12V AC power source that produces a current of 2A. What is the magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil? (Assume the coils are closely wound and the core has infinite permeability.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil, we first need to determine the current in the secondary coil using the transformer equation:\n\nN_primary / N_secondary = I_secondary / I_primary\n\nWhere N_primary and N_secondary are the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils, respectively, and I_primary and I_secondary are the currents in the primary and secondary coils, respectively.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for I_secondary:\n\nI_secondary = (N_primary / N_secondary) * I_primary\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nI_secondary = (100 turns / 500 turns) * 2 A = 0.4 A\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field strength (B) at the center of the secondary coil:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N_secondary * I_secondary) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), N_secondary is the number of turns in the secondary coil, I_secondary is the current in the secondary coil, and r is the radius of the secondary coil.\n\nHowever, we don't have the radius of the secondary coil (r) given in the problem. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil."
