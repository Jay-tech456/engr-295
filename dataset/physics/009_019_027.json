The distance between the slits is 0.2 mm, and the distance between the slits and the screen is 2 m. If the distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe is 4 mm, what is the distance between the first-order bright fringe and the second-order bright fringe on the screen? Show all the steps of your calculations.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the position of bright fringes in the Young's Double Slit Experiment:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central bright fringe and the m-th order bright fringe\nm = order of the bright fringe (0 for central, 1 for first-order, 2 for second-order, etc.)\nλ = wavelength of the light (in meters)\nL = distance between the slits and the screen (in meters)\nd = distance between the slits (in meters)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\nd = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\nL = 2 m\n\nNow, we are given that the distance between the central bright fringe (m=0) and the first-order bright fringe (m=1) is 4 mm:\n\ny1 = (1 * λ * L) / d\n\nWe can plug in the values and solve for y1:\n\ny1 = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9) * 2) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\ny1 = 0.004 m = 4 mm\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between the first-order bright fringe (m=1) and the second-order bright fringe (m=2). To do this, we will first find the position of the second-order bright fringe (y2) and then subtract the position of the first-order bright fringe (y1) from it:\n\ny2 = (2 * λ * L) / d\n\nPlugging in the values and solving for y2:\n\ny2 = (2 * 650 * 10^(-9) * 2) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\ny2 = 0.008 m = 8 mm\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the first-order and second-order bright fringes:\n\nDistance = y2 - y1\nDistance = 8 mm - 4 mm\nDistance = 4 mm\n\nSo, the distance between the first-order bright fringe and the second-order bright fringe on the screen is 4 mm."
