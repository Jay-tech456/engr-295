    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The Higgs boson is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs field. Since its discovery, experimental investigations have been conducted to measure its properties, such as mass, decay channels, and couplings to other particles.\n\nHere are some of the key measurements of the Higgs boson properties:\n\n1. Mass: The mass of the Higgs boson has been measured with high precision. The combined analysis from the ATLAS and CMS experiments determined the mass to be approximately 125.1 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared).\n\n2. Decay channels: The Higgs boson has several decay channels, which are the ways it can decay into other particles. The most significant decay channels observed at the LHC are:\n\n   - Higgs boson decaying into two photons (H → γγ)\n   - Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons (H → ZZ), which subsequently decay into four leptons (electrons or muons)\n   - Higgs boson decaying into two W bosons (H → WW), which subsequently decay into two leptons and two neutrinos\n   - Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (H → bb)\n   - Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons (H → ττ)\n\n3. Couplings: The Higgs boson interacts with other particles through its couplings. The strength of these couplings is proportional to the mass of the particles. Experimental measurements have confirmed that the Higgs boson couples to W and Z bosons, top quarks, bottom quarks, tau leptons, and muons. The observed couplings are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.\n\n4. Spin and parity: The Higgs boson has been confirmed to have a spin of 0 (scalar particle) and positive parity (even under parity transformation), which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction.\n\nIt is important to note that experimental measurements are always subject to uncertainties and are continuously refined as more data is collected and analyzed. The LHC and other future high-energy physics experiments will continue to study the Higgs boson and its properties, potentially revealing new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe."
