    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the thermodynamics of protein-ligand binding. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the binding process is related to the binding constant (K) by the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin (for physiological temperature, T = 310 K).\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change is also related to the enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change (ΔS) by the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nTo find the change in enthalpy and entropy, we need to know the binding constant (K) and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). These values can be obtained from experimental data or from the literature.\n\nOnce we have the values for ΔG and K, we can use the first equation to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH):\n\nΔH = ΔG + TΔS\n\nNext, we can use the second equation to calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (ΔG - ΔH) / T\n\nWith these equations, we can determine the change in enthalpy and entropy when a protein binds to its ligand at physiological temperature. Note that the values for ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are specific to the protein-ligand system being studied and can vary widely depending on the system."
