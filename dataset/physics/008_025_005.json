    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Its decay modes and their branching ratios (probabilities) are essential for understanding and measuring its properties.\n\nThe specific decay modes of the Higgs boson are:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quark-antiquark pair (H → bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. However, it is challenging to detect due to the high background from other processes producing bottom quarks.\n\n2. Higgs to W boson pair (H → WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. One of the W bosons decays into a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino, while the other decays into a quark-antiquark pair. This mode is easier to detect due to the distinctive leptonic signature.\n\n3. Higgs to Z boson pair (H → ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%. Both Z bosons can decay into either a lepton-antilepton pair or a quark-antiquark pair. The four-lepton final state is particularly clean and easy to detect, making it one of the primary discovery channels for the Higgs boson.\n\n4. Higgs to tau lepton-antilepton pair (H → ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%. It is more challenging to detect due to the complex decay modes of tau leptons and the presence of neutrinos in the final state.\n\n5. Higgs to photon pair (H → γγ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%. Despite its rarity, it is one of the most important discovery channels for the Higgs boson due to the excellent energy resolution of the detectors for photons, allowing for a precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass.\n\n6. Higgs to gluon pair (H → gg): This decay mode is not a direct decay but occurs through a loop of heavy quarks (top quarks). It has a branching ratio of about 8.6%. However, it is challenging to detect due to the large background from strong interactions producing jets.\n\nThe measurement of the Higgs boson properties, such as its mass, spin, and couplings to other particles, relies on the accurate identification and reconstruction of its decay products. Different decay modes provide complementary information, and their combination allows for a more precise determination of the Higgs boson properties. By comparing the observed decay rates and properties with the predictions from the Standard Model, physicists can test the validity of the model and search for potential signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model."
