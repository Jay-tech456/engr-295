    "message_1": "What is the most widely accepted solution to the information paradox, which suggests that information cannot be destroyed by the gravitational collapse of a black hole but also cannot be retrieved once it has fallen inside the event horizon?",
    "message_2": "The most widely accepted solution to the information paradox is the holographic principle combined with black hole evaporation through Hawking radiation. This solution suggests that the information about the matter that falls into a black hole is not lost but rather encoded on the event horizon, which is the boundary of the black hole.\n\nWhen a black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, the information encoded on the event horizon is released back into the universe in a highly scrambled form. This process ensures that the information is not destroyed, thus preserving the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, which states that information cannot be lost.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the information paradox is still an active area of research, and there is no universally agreed-upon solution. The holographic principle and black hole evaporation are currently the most widely accepted ideas, but other theories and solutions may emerge as our understanding of black holes and quantum mechanics continues to evolve."
