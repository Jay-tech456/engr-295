    "message_1": "A beam of light is incident on a polarizer with an intensity of 45 W/m². The polarizer makes an angle of 30° with the direction of the beam. What will be the intensity of the transmitted beam through the polarizer?",
    "message_2": "The intensity of the transmitted beam through the polarizer can be calculated using Malus' law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is equal to the initial intensity (I_0) multiplied by the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the plane of polarization of the incident light (θ).\n\nMathematically, Malus' law is given by:\n\nI_t = I_0 * cos²(θ)\n\nGiven the initial intensity I_0 = 45 W/m² and the angle θ = 30°, we can calculate the transmitted intensity:\n\nI_t = 45 * cos²(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 30°:\n\ncos(30°) = √3/2\n\nNow, we can square the cosine value:\n\ncos²(30°) = (√3/2)² = 3/4\n\nFinally, we can calculate the transmitted intensity:\n\nI_t = 45 * (3/4) = 33.75 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted beam through the polarizer is 33.75 W/m²."
