    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the adiabatic process equation and the work done formula for an adiabatic process. \n\nFor an adiabatic process, the equation is:\n(P1 * V1^γ) = (P2 * V2^γ)\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index or the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). For an ideal diatomic gas, γ is approximately 1.4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of γ:\n\nγ = Cp/Cv\nFor a diatomic gas, Cp = 7/2 * R and Cv = 5/2 * R (where R is the gas constant)\nγ = (7/2 * R) / (5/2 * R) = 7/5 = 1.4\n\nNow, we can use the adiabatic process equation to find the work done:\n\n(P1 * V1^γ) = (P2 * V2^γ)\n(3 atm * (5 L)^1.4) = (1 atm * (15 L)^1.4)\n\nNow, we need to solve for the work done (W) during the adiabatic process. The formula for work done in an adiabatic process is:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nW = (3 atm * 5 L - 1 atm * 15 L) / (1.4 - 1)\nW = (15 atm L - 15 atm L) / 0.4\nW = 0 atm L / 0.4\nW = 0 J\n\nThe adiabatic work done by the gas during this process is 0 Joules."
