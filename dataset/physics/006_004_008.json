    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Stark effect formula for the splitting of spectral lines in a hydrogen atom. The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. For the hydrogen atom in the first excited state (n = 2), the energy level splitting due to the Stark effect can be approximated as:\n\nΔE = (3/4) * e * a₀ * F\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the split levels, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), a₀ is the Bohr radius (5.29 × 10^(-11) m), and F is the electric field strength.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given splitting of 1 nm in wavelength to energy. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.63 × 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (1 nm = 10^(-9) m).\n\nΔE = (6.63 × 10^(-34) Js * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (10^(-9) m) = 1.989 × 10^(-25) J\n\nNow, we can use the Stark effect formula to find the electric field strength F:\n\n1.989 × 10^(-25) J = (3/4) * (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (5.29 × 10^(-11) m) * F\n\nSolving for F:\n\nF = (1.989 × 10^(-25) J) / ((3/4) * (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (5.29 × 10^(-11) m))\nF ≈ 1.57 × 10^6 V/m\n\nTherefore, the electric field strength required to split the spectral lines of a hydrogen atom in the first excited state by 1 nm due to the Stark effect is approximately 1.57 × 10^6 V/m."
