    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The charge-to-mass ratio is given as:\n\nQ/M = 0.5\n\nwhere Q is the electric charge and M is the mass of the black hole. We are given that the mass of the black hole is 10 solar masses. To calculate the electric charge, we first need to convert the mass to kilograms.\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 × 10^30 kg\n\nSo, 10 solar masses ≈ 10 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg ≈ 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can use the charge-to-mass ratio to find the electric charge:\n\nQ = (Q/M) × M\nQ = 0.5 × 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nQ ≈ 9.945 × 10^30 Coulombs\n\nTherefore, the electric charge contained within the Reissner-Nordström black hole is approximately 9.945 × 10^30 Coulombs."
