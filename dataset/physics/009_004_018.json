    "message_1": "What is the critical angle for a light ray passing through an acrylic-to-air interface, if the refractive index of acrylic is 1.49 and the angle of incidence is 50 degrees?",
    "message_2": "The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction becomes 90 degrees. To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of acrylic (1.49), and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1). Since we want to find the critical angle (θ1) when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\n1.49 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(90) equals 1, so:\n\n1.49 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle θ1:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.49\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.49)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.8 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle for a light ray passing through an acrylic-to-air interface is approximately 41.8 degrees."
