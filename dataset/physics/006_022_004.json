    "message_2": "To calculate the stopping power of a 2 MeV proton passing through aluminum, we can use the Bethe-Bloch formula, which describes the energy loss of charged particles (like protons) as they pass through a medium (like aluminum). The formula is given by:\n\ndE/dx = -K * z^2 * Z/A * 1/β^2 * (1/2 * ln(2 * m_e * c^2 * β^2 * γ^2 * I^(-1)) - β^2)\n\nwhere:\ndE/dx is the stopping power (energy loss per unit distance)\nK is a constant (0.307075 MeV * cm^2 / mol)\nz is the charge of the incident particle (protons have a charge of +1)\nZ is the atomic number of the medium (aluminum has Z = 13)\nA is the atomic mass of the medium (aluminum has A ≈ 27 g/mol)\nβ is the velocity of the incident particle relative to the speed of light (β = v/c)\nγ is the Lorentz factor (γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2))\nm_e is the electron mass (≈ 0.511 MeV/c^2)\nc is the speed of light (≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s)\nI is the mean excitation energy of the medium (for aluminum, I ≈ 166 eV)\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity (β) and Lorentz factor (γ) of the 2 MeV proton. The total energy of the proton is given by:\n\nE_total = m_p * c^2 * γ\n\nwhere m_p is the proton mass (≈ 938.27 MeV/c^2). Rearranging for γ, we get:\n\nγ = E_total / (m_p * c^2) = 2 MeV / 938.27 MeV = 1.00213\n\nNow, we can find β using the relation:\n\nβ^2 = 1 - 1/γ^2 = 1 - 1/1.00213^2 ≈ 0.00424\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the Bethe-Bloch formula:\n\ndE/dx = -0.307075 * 1^2 * 13/27 * 1/0.00424 * (1/2 * ln(2 * 0.511 * 0.00424 * 1.00213^2 * 166^(-1)) - 0.00424) ≈ -1.76 MeV/cm\n\nThe stopping power is approximately -1.76 MeV/cm. The negative sign indicates that the proton is losing energy as it passes through the aluminum. To find the total energy loss in 1 cm of aluminum, we can multiply the stopping power by the thickness:\n\nEnergy loss = dE/dx * thickness = -1.76 MeV/cm * 1 cm = -1.76 MeV\n\nSo, the 2 MeV proton will lose approximately 1.76 MeV of energy when passing through 1 cm of aluminum."
