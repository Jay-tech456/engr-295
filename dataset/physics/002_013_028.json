    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at a temperature of 500 K and a cold reservoir at a temperature of 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine. If the engine absorbs 5000 J of heat energy from the hot reservoir in each cycle, what is the net work done by the engine? (Assume the heat engine is ideal and has no friction or other losses.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine, we can use the following formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir.\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the engine is 40%.\n\nNow, to calculate the net work done by the engine, we can use the following formula:\n\nW_net = Q_hot * Carnot efficiency\n\nwhere W_net is the net work done by the engine, Q_hot is the heat energy absorbed from the hot reservoir, and Carnot efficiency is the efficiency calculated above.\n\nW_net = 5000 J * 0.4 = 2000 J\n\nTherefore, the net work done by the engine is 2000 Joules."
