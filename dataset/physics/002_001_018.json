    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during this process, we can use the formula for work done at constant pressure:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in volume (ΔV):\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial\nΔV = 8.0 L - 4.0 L\nΔV = 4.0 L\n\nNow we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = P * ΔV\nW = 2.0 atm * 4.0 L\n\nHowever, we need to convert the units to Joules (J). We can use the conversion factor: 1 atm * L = 101.3 J.\n\nW = 2.0 atm * 4.0 L * (101.3 J / (1 atm * L))\nW = 8.0 * 101.3 J\nW = 810.4 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during this process is approximately 810.4 Joules."
