    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the circular disc, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, we can define a current density J (current per unit area) as:\n\nJ = I / (πR^2)\n\nNow, consider a small circular strip of radius x and thickness dx on the disc. The area of this strip is dA = 2πx dx. The current flowing through this strip is:\n\ndI = J * dA = (I / (πR^2)) * 2πx dx\n\nThe magnetic field due to this strip at the center of the disc is perpendicular to the plane of the disc. Using the Biot-Savart law, we can write the magnetic field contribution dB due to this strip as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πx) / x^3\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire disc (from x = 0 to x = R) to find the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to R\n\nB = ∫((μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πx) / x^3) dx from 0 to R\n\nSubstitute dI:\n\nB = ∫((μ₀ / 4π) * ((I / (πR^2)) * 2πx dx * 2πx) / x^3) dx from 0 to R\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / R^2 * ∫(x dx) from 0 to R\n\nIntegrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / R^2 * [x^2 / 2] from 0 to R\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / R^2 * (R^2 / 2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / 2\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular disc is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / 2"
