    "message_2": "To calculate the internal energy of the gas, we can use the formula:\n\nInternal energy (U) = n * C_v * T\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, C_v is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nHowever, we are given the molar heat capacity at constant pressure (C_p), not at constant volume (C_v). To find C_v, we can use the relationship between C_p and C_v for an ideal gas:\n\nC_p = C_v + R\n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K).\n\nFirst, let's find C_v:\n\nC_v = C_p - R\nC_v = 30 J/mol*K - 8.314 J/mol*K\nC_v ≈ 21.686 J/mol*K\n\nNow we can calculate the internal energy:\n\nU = n * C_v * T\nU = 2 moles * 21.686 J/mol*K * 300 K\nU ≈ 13011.6 J\n\nThe internal energy of the gas in the container is approximately 13,011.6 Joules."
