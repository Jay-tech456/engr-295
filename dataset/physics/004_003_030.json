    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime fabric surrounding a massive object is described by the theory of General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein. In this theory, massive objects like stars and planets cause a curvature in spacetime, which is a four-dimensional fabric that combines the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.\n\nThe curvature of spacetime around a massive object is determined by the object's mass and the distance from the object. The greater the mass of the object, the more it curves spacetime. Similarly, the closer an object is to the massive body, the more it experiences the curvature of spacetime.\n\nThis curvature of spacetime affects the path that objects and photons take as they move through the surrounding region. Objects and photons follow the shortest path, or geodesic, through the curved spacetime. This causes objects to experience what we perceive as gravity. For example, the Earth orbits the Sun because it follows a geodesic path through the curved spacetime caused by the Sun's mass.\n\nIn the case of photons, their path is also affected by the curvature of spacetime. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing. When light from a distant object, like a star or galaxy, passes close to a massive object, its path is bent due to the curvature of spacetime. This can cause the light to be focused or defocused, leading to multiple images or distorted images of the distant object as seen by an observer.\n\nIn summary, the curvature of spacetime fabric surrounding a massive object is determined by the object's mass and distance from it. This curvature affects the path that objects and photons take as they move through the surrounding region, causing phenomena such as gravity and gravitational lensing."
