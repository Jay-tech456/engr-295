    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a free particle is known as the Klein-Gordon equation. It is given by:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (mc²/ℏ)²)ψ(x,t) = 0\n\nwhere ψ(x,t) is the wave function of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nThe non-relativistic wave equation, on the other hand, is the Schrödinger equation:\n\n(-ℏ²/2m)∇²ψ(x,t) + V(x)ψ(x,t) = iℏ(∂/∂t)ψ(x,t)\n\nThe main difference between the two equations is that the Klein-Gordon equation is a second-order differential equation in time, while the Schrödinger equation is a first-order differential equation in time. The Klein-Gordon equation also incorporates the relativistic energy-momentum relation, whereas the Schrödinger equation is based on the non-relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nTo solve for the energy and momentum of a particle given the relativistic wave function, we can use the energy-momentum relation for a relativistic particle:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle and p is its momentum.\n\nWe can rewrite the Klein-Gordon equation in terms of the energy and momentum operators:\n\n(-ℏ²∇² + m²c⁴)ψ(x,t) = E²ψ(x,t)\n\nApplying the momentum operator to the wave function:\n\np = -iℏ∇ψ(x,t)\n\nSquaring both sides and substituting into the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE²ψ(x,t) = (-ℏ²∇² + m²c⁴)ψ(x,t)\n\nNow, we can solve for the energy and momentum of the particle by finding the eigenvalues of the energy and momentum operators acting on the wave function. This will give us the allowed energy and momentum values for the particle described by the given relativistic wave function."
