    "message_2": "The production of a new heavy particle, such as a W' or Z' boson, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with an energy of 13 TeV would result in various decay products and signatures in the detector. These decay products and signatures depend on the decay channels of the new heavy particle.\n\nFor a W' boson, the possible decay channels are:\n\n1. W' -> lν (l = e, μ, or τ): In this case, the decay products would be a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau) and a neutrino. The signature in the detector would be a high transverse momentum (pT) lepton and missing transverse energy (MET) due to the undetected neutrino.\n\n2. W' -> q'q: Here, the decay products would be a pair of quarks, which would manifest as jets in the detector. The signature would be two high pT jets with a large invariant mass consistent with the mass of the W' boson.\n\nFor a Z' boson, the possible decay channels are:\n\n1. Z' -> ll (l = e, μ, or τ): In this case, the decay products would be a pair of charged leptons (electron, muon, or tau). The signature in the detector would be two high pT leptons with an invariant mass consistent with the mass of the Z' boson.\n\n2. Z' -> νν: Here, the decay products would be a pair of neutrinos. The signature in the detector would be a large missing transverse energy (MET) due to the undetected neutrinos.\n\n3. Z' -> q'q: In this case, the decay products would be a pair of quarks, which would manifest as jets in the detector. The signature would be two high pT jets with a large invariant mass consistent with the mass of the Z' boson.\n\nTo search for these new heavy particles, physicists would look for an excess of events with these signatures in the data compared to the expected background from known Standard Model processes. The discovery of a W' or Z' boson would be a significant breakthrough in particle physics, as it would indicate the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model."
