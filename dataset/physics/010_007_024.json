    "message_1": "A rectangular metal cube with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm is completely submerged in water. If the density of the metal cube is 8,000 kg/m³, what is the net downward force acting on the cube due to buoyancy and hydrostatic pressure?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the volume of the cube and its mass.\n\nVolume (V) = length × width × height\nV = 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm = 1,000 cm³\n\nSince 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, we need to convert the volume to m³.\n\nV = 1,000 cm³ × (1 m³ / 1,000,000 cm³) = 0.001 m³\n\nNow we can find the mass of the cube.\n\nMass (m) = density × volume\nm = 8,000 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ = 8 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the buoyant force acting on the cube. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the cube. The density of water is 1,000 kg/m³.\n\nBuoyant force (F_b) = density of water × volume of cube × gravitational acceleration\nF_b = 1,000 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ × 9.81 m/s² = 9.81 N\n\nNow we need to find the weight of the cube, which is the force due to gravity acting on the cube.\n\nWeight (W) = mass × gravitational acceleration\nW = 8 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 78.48 N\n\nFinally, we can find the net downward force acting on the cube.\n\nNet downward force (F_net) = weight - buoyant force\nF_net = 78.48 N - 9.81 N = 68.67 N\n\nThe net downward force acting on the cube due to buoyancy and hydrostatic pressure is 68.67 N."
