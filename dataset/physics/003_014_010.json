    "message_1": "A rectangular wire loop has dimensions of 20 cm by 30 cm and carries a current of 5 A. Determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop assuming the wire has zero resistance.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular wire loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire loop is rectangular and has zero resistance, we can break the problem into four segments (the four sides of the rectangle) and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields from each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider the four segments of the rectangular loop:\n\n1. Top segment: 20 cm long, horizontal\n2. Bottom segment: 20 cm long, horizontal\n3. Left segment: 30 cm long, vertical\n4. Right segment: 30 cm long, vertical\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the magnetic field contributions at the center will be in the same direction (out of the plane) and have the same magnitude, so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one of them and then multiply by 2.\n\nFor the left and right segments, the magnetic field contributions at the center will also be in the same direction (out of the plane) and have the same magnitude, so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one of them and then multiply by 2.\n\nLet's first calculate the magnetic field due to the top segment at the center:\n\ndB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sinθ) / r²\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r. For the top segment, θ = 90°, so sinθ = 1.\n\nThe distance r from the top segment to the center is half of the vertical side length, which is 15 cm or 0.15 m.\n\nThe length of the top segment is 20 cm or 0.2 m. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the top segment to find the total magnetic field contribution:\n\nB_top = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl) / r²\n\nB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * ∫dl\n\nSince the current and distance are constants, we can integrate dl from 0 to 0.2 m:\n\nB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * 0.2\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to the left segment at the center:\n\ndB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sinθ) / r²\n\nFor the left segment, θ = 90°, so sinθ = 1.\n\nThe distance r from the left segment to the center is half of the horizontal side length, which is 10 cm or 0.1 m.\n\nThe length of the left segment is 30 cm or 0.3 m. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the left segment to find the total magnetic field contribution:\n\nB_left = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl) / r²\n\nB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * ∫dl\n\nSince the current and distance are constants, we can integrate dl from 0 to 0.3 m:\n\nB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r²) * 0.3\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields from each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_center = 2 * B_top + 2 * B_left\n\nB_center = 2 * [(μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r_top²) * 0.2] + 2 * [(μ₀ / 4π) * (I / r_left²) * 0.3]\n\nGiven the current I = 5 A, r_top = 0.15 m, and r_left = 0.1 m:\n\nB_center = 2 * [(4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (5 A / 0.15² m²) * 0.2] + 2 * [(4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (5 A / 0.1² m²) * 0.3]\n\nB_center = 2 * [(10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (5 A / 0.0225 m²) * 0.2] + 2 * [(10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (5 A / 0.01 m²) * 0.3]\n\nB_center = 2 * [4.44 × 10⁻⁵ T] + 2 * [1.5 × 10⁻⁴ T]\n\nB_center = 8.88 × 10⁻⁵ T + 3 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nB_center ≈ 3.89 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular wire loop is approximately 3.89 × 10⁻⁴ T."
