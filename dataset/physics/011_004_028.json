    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of a silicon crystal at room temperature, we can use the following formula:\n\nThermal Conductivity (k) = Specific Heat (C) × Phonon Mean Free Path (L) × Phonon Group Velocity (v)\n\nFirst, we need to know the specific heat and phonon group velocity for silicon. At room temperature, the specific heat (C) of silicon is approximately 700 J/kg·K, and the phonon group velocity (v) is approximately 5,000 m/s.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nPhonon Mean Free Path (L) = 50 nm = 50 × 10^(-9) m\n\nThermal Conductivity (k) = (700 J/kg·K) × (50 × 10^(-9) m) × (5,000 m/s)\n\nThermal Conductivity (k) ≈ 175 W/m·K\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of a defect-free silicon crystal at room temperature with a phonon mean free path of 50 nm is approximately 175 W/m·K."
