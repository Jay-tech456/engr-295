    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given the total number of turns (N = 250) and the cross-sectional area (A = 0.5 cm²). To find the length of the solenoid, we can assume it's a cylinder and use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\nV = A * L\n\nwhere V is the volume and L is the length. We don't have the volume, but we can find the length (L) by dividing the total number of turns (N) by the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nL = N / n\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for L into the volume formula:\n\nV = A * (N / n)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for n:\n\nn = N / (V / A)\n\nWe still don't have the volume (V), but we can find it by using the formula for the volume of a solenoid:\n\nV = π * r² * L\n\nwhere r is the radius of the solenoid. We can find the radius by using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * r²\n\nSolving for r:\n\nr = sqrt(A / π)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for r into the volume formula:\n\nV = π * (A / π) * L\n\nSimplifying:\n\nV = A * L\n\nNow we have the volume in terms of the area and length, which we can substitute back into the formula for n:\n\nn = N / (A * L)\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\nn = 250 / (0.5 cm² * 10 cm)\n\nn = 250 / 5 cm³\n\nn = 50 turns/cm\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field (B) using the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (50 turns/cm) * (5 A)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of turns per unit length from turns/cm to turns/m:\n\nn = 50 turns/cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 5000 turns/m\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (5000 turns/m) * (5 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 25000 A/turns\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the solenoid located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the solenoid is approximately 3.14 × 10⁻⁶ T."
