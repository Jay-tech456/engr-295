    "message_2": "The theoretical explanation for the lack of observed electromagnetic radiation from dark atoms or dark molecules lies in the nature of dark matter itself. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect electromagnetic radiation like visible light, radio waves, or X-rays.\n\nThe reason dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation is that it is believed to be composed of particles that only interact through gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force, but not through the electromagnetic force. This means that dark matter particles do not have electric charges, and thus do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation like normal atoms or molecules do.\n\nThe idea that dark matter is composed of dark atoms or dark molecules is based on the assumption that these particles could form bound states similar to ordinary atoms and molecules, but without interacting electromagnetically. This would mean that dark atoms or dark molecules would still not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, consistent with the observational evidence.\n\nThe lack of observed electromagnetic radiation from dark atoms or dark molecules supports the idea that dark matter is composed of these particles, as it is consistent with the expected behavior of dark matter. However, it does not prove that dark matter is composed of dark atoms or dark molecules, as there may be other types of particles or explanations that could also account for the observed properties of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the lack of observed electromagnetic radiation from dark atoms or dark molecules is consistent with the theoretical properties of dark matter, but it does not provide definitive evidence for or against the idea that dark matter is composed of these particles. Further research and observations are needed to better understand the nature of dark matter and its possible composition."
