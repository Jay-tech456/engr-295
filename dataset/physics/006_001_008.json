    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required for an electron to transition from one energy level to another in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two levels:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the initial energy level (n=2), the energy is:\n\nE_initial = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nFor the final energy level (n=4), the energy is:\n\nE_final = -13.6 eV / (4^2) = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to transition an electron from the n=2 energy level to the n=4 energy level of a hydrogen atom is 2.55 electron volts (eV)."
