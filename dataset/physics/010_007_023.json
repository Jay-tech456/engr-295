    "message_1": "A rectangular block of wood with dimensions 10 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm is floating in water with 2 cm of its height above the surface. Determine the density of the wood if the density of water is 1000 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To determine the density of the wood, we can use the principle of buoyancy. The buoyant force acting on the block is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the block. The weight of the block is equal to the product of its volume and density.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the block submerged in water:\n\nThe height submerged in water is 4 cm - 2 cm = 2 cm.\n\nThe volume of the submerged part of the block is:\nV_submerged = length × width × height_submerged\nV_submerged = 10 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm\nV_submerged = 120 cm³\n\nNow, let's convert the volume to meters cubed:\nV_submerged = 120 cm³ × (1 m/100 cm)³\nV_submerged = 120 × 10^(-6) m³\n\nThe buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the block:\nF_buoyant = V_submerged × density_water × g\nF_buoyant = 120 × 10^(-6) m³ × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s²\nF_buoyant = 1.1772 N\n\nNow, let's find the total volume of the block:\nV_total = length × width × height\nV_total = 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm\nV_total = 240 cm³\n\nConvert the volume to meters cubed:\nV_total = 240 cm³ × (1 m/100 cm)³\nV_total = 240 × 10^(-6) m³\n\nThe weight of the block is equal to the buoyant force:\nW_block = F_buoyant\nW_block = 1.1772 N\n\nThe weight of the block is also equal to the product of its volume, density, and gravitational acceleration:\nW_block = V_total × density_wood × g\n\nNow, we can solve for the density of the wood:\ndensity_wood = W_block / (V_total × g)\ndensity_wood = 1.1772 N / (240 × 10^(-6) m³ × 9.81 m/s²)\ndensity_wood ≈ 500 kg/m³\n\nThe density of the wood is approximately 500 kg/m³."
