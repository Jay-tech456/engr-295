    "message_1": "A polygon loop in the shape of a square is carrying a current of 2.5 A. Each side of the square is 0.1 m long. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 0.2 meters away from one of the corners of the square, assuming that the current flows in a clockwise direction around the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current flows in a clockwise direction around the loop, we can divide the square loop into four segments, each with a length of 0.1 m. We will calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the given point.\n\nLet's label the corners of the square as A, B, C, and D in a clockwise direction, with A being the corner closest to the point of interest (0.2 m away). The point of interest is along the diagonal of the square, so we can use symmetry to simplify the problem. The magnetic field contributions from segments AB and CD will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so they will cancel each other out. Similarly, the magnetic field contributions from segments BC and DA will also cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, we only need to calculate the magnetic field contribution from one segment, say segment BC, and then multiply it by 2 to account for the contribution from segment DA.\n\nLet's consider segment BC. We will integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the segment to find the magnetic field contribution:\n\nB = 2 * ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nThe position vector r for the point of interest with respect to segment BC can be written as:\n\nr = <0.1, 0.2> - <x, 0>\n\nwhere x varies from 0 to 0.1 m along the segment BC. The current element dl can be written as:\n\ndl = <dx, 0>\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = <0, 0, -0.2dx>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((0.1 - x)² + 0.2²)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate:\n\nB = 2 * ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\nB = 2 * (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(-0.2dx) / ((0.1 - x)² + 0.2²)^(3/2) from x = 0 to 0.1\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nB = 2 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2.5 A) * ∫(-0.2dx) / ((0.1 - x)² + 0.2²)^(3/2) from x = 0 to 0.1\nB ≈ -1.0 × 10⁻⁶ * ∫(-0.2dx) / ((0.1 - x)² + 0.2²)^(3/2) from x = 0 to 0.1\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nB ≈ -1.0 × 10⁻⁶ * [-1.0 / sqrt((0.1 - x)² + 0.2²)] from x = 0 to 0.1\nB ≈ -1.0 × 10⁻⁶ * [-1.0 / sqrt(0.05) + 1.0 / sqrt(0.01)]\nB ≈ -1.0 × 10⁻⁶ * (-2.236 + 10)\nB ≈ 7.764 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located 0.2 meters away from one of the corners of the square is approximately 7.764 × 10⁻⁶ T.\n\nSince the magnetic field contribution from segment BC is in the negative z-direction, and the contribution from segment DA is in the positive z-direction, the total magnetic field at the point of interest will be in the positive z-direction. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field is upwards."
