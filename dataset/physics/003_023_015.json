    "message_1": "A generator consists of a coil of 50 turns, and its length and width are 20 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The coil has a current of 5 A flowing through it. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a rectangular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I * a * b) / (2 * π * (a^2 + b^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns, I is the current, a is the length of the coil, and b is the width of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nn = 50 turns\nI = 5 A\na = 20 cm = 0.2 m\nb = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 50 * 5 A * 0.2 m * 0.1 m) / (2 * π * (0.2^2 + 0.1^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) * 50 * 5 * 0.2 * 0.1) / (2 * π * (0.04 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (10^(-6) * 50 * 5 * 0.02) / (0.05^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 0.0001 / 0.01118\n\nB ≈ 0.00894 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 0.00894 Tesla."
