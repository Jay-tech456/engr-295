Calculate the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance d from the center of the sheet along an axis passing through the sheet's center and parallel to one of its sides.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀/4π) * (I * dl × r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the sheet, we can define a current density J = I / (L * W). Then, the current through a small strip of width dx at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the axis parallel to the width is given by:\n\ndI = J * L * dx\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element Idl = dI * dy at a distance y from the center of the sheet along the axis parallel to the length. The position vector r from this current element to point P is:\n\nr = (x, y, d)\n\nThe differential length vector dl is in the direction of the current, which is perpendicular to the plane of the sheet:\n\ndl = (0, 0, dy)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross product dl × r:\n\ndl × r = (dy * d, -dy * x, 0)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀/4π) * (dI * (dy * d, -dy * x, 0)) / r^3\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate this expression over the entire sheet. We can do this by integrating over the width (from -W/2 to W/2) and the length (from -L/2 to L/2) of the sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀/4π) * ∫∫ (dI * (dy * d, -dy * x, 0)) / r^3 dx dy\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, we can simplify the integration by considering only one quadrant of the sheet and then multiplying the result by 4:\n\nB = 4 * (μ₀/4π) * ∫∫ (dI * (dy * d, -dy * x, 0)) / r^3 dx dy, where the integration limits are from 0 to W/2 for x and from 0 to L/2 for y.\n\nNow, we can substitute dI = J * L * dx and perform the integration:\n\nB = 4 * (μ₀/4π) * J * L * ∫∫ ((dy * d, -dy * x, 0)) / r^3 dx dy\n\nB = μ₀ * J * L * ∫∫ ((dy * d, -dy * x, 0)) / r^3 dx dy\n\nNow, we can integrate the x and y components separately:\n\nB_x = μ₀ * J * L * ∫∫ (dy * d) / r^3 dx dy\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * ∫∫ (dy * x) / r^3 dx dy\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the x-component of the magnetic field will cancel out, leaving only the y-component:\n\nB = B_y\n\nTo calculate B_y, we can first integrate with respect to x:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * ∫ (dy * ∫ (x / (x^2 + y^2 + d^2)^(3/2)) dx) dy\n\nThe inner integral can be evaluated using a substitution: let u = x^2 + y^2 + d^2, then du = 2x dx:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * ∫ (dy * (1/2) * ∫ (1 / u^(3/2)) du) dy\n\nThe inner integral evaluates to:\n\n∫ (1 / u^(3/2)) du = -2 / sqrt(u) + C\n\nNow, we can substitute back x^2 + y^2 + d^2 for u and evaluate the integral from 0 to W/2:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * ∫ (dy * (1/2) * (-2 / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + d^2)) | from 0 to W/2) dy\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * ∫ (dy * (1/2) * (2 / sqrt((W/2)^2 + y^2 + d^2) - 2 / sqrt(y^2 + d^2))) dy\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to y:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (1/2) * (2 * ∫ (1 / sqrt((W/2)^2 + y^2 + d^2) - 1 / sqrt(y^2 + d^2)) dy) from 0 to L/2\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use a trigonometric substitution: let y = (W/2) * tan(θ), then dy = (W/2) * sec^2(θ) dθ, and the limits of integration change from 0 to arctan(L/W):\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (1/2) * (2 * ∫ ((W/2) * sec^2(θ) / (W * sqrt(sec^2(θ))) - (W/2) * sec^2(θ) / (W * sqrt(tan^2(θ) + (d/W)^2))) dθ) from 0 to arctan(L/W)\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (1/2) * (2 * ∫ (sec(θ) - sec(θ) / sqrt(tan^2(θ) + (d/W)^2)) dθ) from 0 to arctan(L/W)\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to θ:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (1/2) * (2 * (θ - arctan((d/W) * tan(θ))) | from 0 to arctan(L/W))\n\nFinally, we can substitute back arctan(L/W) for θ:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (1/2) * (2 * (arctan(L/W) - arctan((d/W) * tan(arctan(L/W)))))\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * J * L * (arctan(L/W) - arctan((d/W) * (L/W)))\n\nNow, we can substitute back I / (L * W) for J:\n\nB_y = -μ₀ * I * (arctan(L/W) - arctan((d/W) * (L/W))) / W\n\nThis is the magnetic field at point P located at a distance d from the center of the rectangular sheet along an axis passing through the sheet's center and parallel to one of its sides."
