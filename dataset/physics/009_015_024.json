    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens at different distances from the optical axis are not focused at the same point. This results in a blurred image. To find the spherical aberration, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R1 = +15 cm and R2 = -10 cm, and the refractive index n = 1.5, we can find the focal length:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/15 - 1/-10)\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/15 + 1/10)\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/6)\nf = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the focal length, we can analyze the spherical aberration. The spherical aberration is caused by the difference in the focal lengths of the marginal and paraxial rays. The marginal rays are the rays that pass through the lens near its edge, while the paraxial rays are the rays that pass through the lens close to the optical axis.\n\nTo minimize spherical aberration, we can use one or more of the following methods:\n\n1. Use an aspheric lens: An aspheric lens has a non-spherical surface that can help reduce spherical aberration. By changing the shape of the lens, the marginal and paraxial rays can be focused at the same point, resulting in a sharper image.\n\n2. Use a combination of lenses: By using a combination of lenses with different curvatures and refractive indices, the spherical aberration of the overall system can be reduced. This is commonly done in optical systems such as telescopes and microscopes.\n\n3. Stop down the aperture: By reducing the aperture size, the marginal rays are blocked, and only the paraxial rays pass through the lens. This can help reduce spherical aberration but may also result in a dimmer image due to less light entering the system.\n\n4. Use a lens with a higher refractive index: A lens with a higher refractive index can help reduce spherical aberration by bending the light rays more effectively. However, this may also introduce other optical aberrations, such as chromatic aberration.\n\nIn summary, the spherical aberration of the given lens can be minimized by using an aspheric lens, a combination of lenses, stopping down the aperture, or using a lens with a higher refractive index."
