Assume that the particle is moving in a circular orbit around the black hole with a radius of r=5GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.",
    "message_2": "To find the angular velocity of a test particle in a circular orbit around a Kerr black hole, we can use the formula for the angular velocity in the equatorial plane:\n\nω = (c³ / GM) * (1 / (r³ + a²r + 2a²GM/c²))\n\nwhere ω is the angular velocity, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, r is the radius of the orbit, and a is the spin parameter of the black hole.\n\nGiven the values a = 0.87 and r = 5GM/c², we can plug these into the formula:\n\nω = (c³ / GM) * (1 / ((5GM/c²)³ + (0.87)²(5GM/c²) + 2(0.87)²GM/c²))\n\nTo simplify the expression, let's first substitute x = GM/c²:\n\nω = (c³ / x) * (1 / (5x)³ + (0.87)²(5x) + 2(0.87)²x)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nω = (c³ / x) * (1 / (125x³ + 0.7569(5x) + 2(0.7569)x))\n\nω = (c³ / x) * (1 / (125x³ + 3.7845x + 1.5138x))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nω = (c³ / x) * (1 / (125x³ + 5.2983x))\n\nNow, we can plug back in x = GM/c²:\n\nω = (c³ / (GM/c²)) * (1 / (125(GM/c²)³ + 5.2983(GM/c²)))\n\nω = (c⁵ / GM²) * (1 / (125(GM/c²)³ + 5.2983(GM/c²)))\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular velocity:\n\nω ≈ (c⁵ / GM²) * (1 / (125(5)³ + 5.2983(5)))\n\nω ≈ (c⁵ / GM²) * (1 / (15625 + 26.4915))\n\nω ≈ (c⁵ / GM²) * (1 / 15651.4915)\n\nThis is the angular velocity of the test particle relative to a stationary observer located at an infinite distance from the Kerr black hole."
