    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a mixture of 50% water and 50% ethylene glycol, with a total mass of 2 kg, initially at a temperature of 25°C, if it is heated to a final temperature of 60°C, assuming constant pressure and negligible heat transfer to the environment?",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of the mixture, we first need to find the specific heat capacity of each component (water and ethylene glycol) and then use a weighted average based on their mass fractions.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water (c_water) is approximately 4.18 kJ/(kg·K), and the specific heat capacity of ethylene glycol (c_glycol) is approximately 2.4 kJ/(kg·K).\n\nSince the mixture is 50% water and 50% ethylene glycol by mass, we can find the mass of each component:\n\nmass_water = 0.5 * 2 kg = 1 kg\nmass_glycol = 0.5 * 2 kg = 1 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weighted average of the specific heat capacities:\n\nc_mixture = (mass_water * c_water + mass_glycol * c_glycol) / (mass_water + mass_glycol)\n\nc_mixture = (1 kg * 4.18 kJ/(kg·K) + 1 kg * 2.4 kJ/(kg·K)) / (1 kg + 1 kg)\n\nc_mixture = (4.18 kJ/K + 2.4 kJ/K) / 2\n\nc_mixture = 6.58 kJ/K / 2\n\nc_mixture = 3.29 kJ/(kg·K)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the mixture is approximately 3.29 kJ/(kg·K)."
