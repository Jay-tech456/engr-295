    "message_1": "A toroidal coil has a radius of 5 cm and 200 turns of wire. When a current of 4A flows through the coil, what is the magnetic field strength at a point that is 2 cm from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a point 2 cm from the center of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nIn the case of a toroidal coil, the magnetic field is confined within the toroid and is constant along a circular path centered on the toroid axis. Therefore, we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * N * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, r is the distance from the center of the toroid, N is the number of turns of wire, and I is the current flowing through the coil.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Radius of the toroid (R) = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n- Distance from the center of the toroid (r) = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n- Number of turns of wire (N) = 200\n- Current flowing through the coil (I) = 4 A\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, approximately equal to 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nB * 2π(0.02) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 200 * 4\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 200 * 4) / (2π * 0.02)\n\nB ≈ 0.0004 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point 2 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 0.0004 T (tesla)."
