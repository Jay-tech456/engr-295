    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. The formula is as follows:\n\nE_GW = (G/c^5) * (1/5) * I * ε^2 * f^6 * t\n\nwhere:\nE_GW = energy emitted in gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nc = speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\nI = moment of inertia of the progenitor star\nε = ellipticity (dimensionless, a measure of the asymmetry of the mass distribution)\nf = frequency of the oscillation (Hz)\nt = duration of the emission (s)\n\nTo calculate the moment of inertia (I) of the progenitor star, we can use the following formula for a uniform sphere:\n\nI = (2/5) * M * R^2\n\nwhere:\nM = mass of the progenitor star (kg)\nR = radius of the progenitor star (m)\n\nNow, let's assume we have the mass (M) and radius (R) of the progenitor star. We can calculate the moment of inertia (I) using the formula above.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the ellipticity (ε), frequency (f), and duration (t) of the emission. These values can vary significantly depending on the specific supernova event and the details of the explosion. For a rough estimate, we can use the following values:\n\nε ~ 10^-6 (typical value for core-collapse supernovae)\nf ~ 1000 Hz (typical value for core-collapse supernovae)\nt ~ 1 s (typical value for core-collapse supernovae)\n\nWith these values, we can now calculate the energy emitted in gravitational waves (E_GW) using the quadrupole formula. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual energy emitted can vary depending on the specific details of the supernova explosion."
