    "message_2": "To calculate the beta function for a self-interacting scalar field theory in 4 dimensions using perturbation theory up to 1-loop order in quantum field theory, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the Lagrangian for a self-interacting scalar field theory:\n\nL = (1/2)(∂_μφ)(∂^μφ) - (1/2)m^2φ^2 - (λ/4!)φ^4\n\nHere, φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the coupling constant.\n\n2. Calculate the Feynman rules for the theory. For this theory, there are three types of vertices: propagators, mass terms, and interaction terms. The propagator is given by:\n\nΔ(p) = i/(p^2 - m^2 + iε)\n\nThe mass term is given by:\n\n-1/2 m^2\n\nThe interaction term is given by:\n\n-λ/4!\n\n3. Calculate the 1-loop corrections to the 2-point and 4-point functions. For the 2-point function, there is one 1-loop diagram: the tadpole diagram. For the 4-point function, there are two 1-loop diagrams: the sunset diagram and the double-bubble diagram.\n\n4. Use the renormalization conditions to absorb the divergences in the loop diagrams. This will give you the renormalized mass and coupling constant:\n\nm_R^2 = m^2 + δm^2\nλ_R = λ + δλ\n\n5. Calculate the beta function for the coupling constant λ. The beta function is defined as:\n\nβ(λ) = μ(dλ_R/dμ)\n\nwhere μ is the renormalization scale. To calculate the beta function, differentiate the renormalized coupling constant λ_R with respect to the renormalization scale μ.\n\n6. For a self-interacting scalar field theory in 4 dimensions, the 1-loop beta function is given by:\n\nβ(λ) = (3/2π^2)λ^2\n\nThis beta function describes how the coupling constant λ changes with the energy scale. A positive beta function indicates that the coupling constant increases with energy, while a negative beta function indicates that the coupling constant decreases with energy. In this case, the beta function is positive, which means that the coupling constant increases with energy, leading to a non-asymptotically free theory."
