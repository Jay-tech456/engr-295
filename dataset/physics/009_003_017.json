    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we need to find the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) can be found using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90 degrees. So, we have:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2\n\nNow, we can plug in the refractive indices of glass (n1 = 1.5) and air (n2 = 1):\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nTo find the maximum angle of incidence (θ1), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle of incidence for a light ray passing from glass to air such that it undergoes total internal reflection at the interface is approximately 41.81 degrees."
