The student has data on the enthalpy of vaporization of water at various temperatures and the boiling point of water at standard pressure. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, calculate the vapor pressure of water at 50°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 50°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we need the following information:\n\n1. Enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) at the given temperature (50°C or 323.15 K)\n2. Boiling point of water at standard pressure (100°C or 373.15 K)\n3. Vapor pressure of water at the boiling point (P2)\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 is the vapor pressure at temperature T1 (50°C), P2 is the vapor pressure at temperature T2 (100°C), ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of vaporization at 50°C. If the student has data on the enthalpy of vaporization at various temperatures, they should look up the value for 50°C. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume the enthalpy of vaporization at 50°C is approximately 40,700 J/mol.\n\nNext, we need the vapor pressure of water at the boiling point (100°C). At the boiling point, the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which is 101.3 kPa or 101325 Pa.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P1/101325) = (40700/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/323.15)\n\nSolving for P1:\n\nP1 = 101325 * exp((40700/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/323.15))\nP1 ≈ 12347.6 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 12,347.6 Pa or 12.35 kPa."
