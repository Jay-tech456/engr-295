    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the rectangular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a^2) / (2 * π * (a^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current (2 A)\na is the radius of an equivalent circular loop with the same area as the rectangular loop\nx is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis (0.3 m)\n\nFirst, we need to find the equivalent circular loop radius (a). The area of the rectangular loop is:\n\nArea = width * length = 0.1 m * 0.2 m = 0.02 m²\n\nNow, let's find the equivalent circular loop with the same area:\n\nArea = π * a^2\n\nSolving for a:\n\na^2 = Area / π\na = sqrt(Area / π) = sqrt(0.02 m² / π) ≈ 0.0796 m\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.0796 m)^2) / (2 * π * (0.0796 m^2 + 0.3 m^2)^(3/2))\nB ≈ (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.00634 m^2) / (2 * π * (0.07396 m^2)^(3/2))\nB ≈ (5.027 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.07396 m^2)^(3/2)\nB ≈ 5.027 × 10^(-6) T / 0.0201\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, 0.3 m away from the center of the loop, is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
