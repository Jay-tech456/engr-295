    "message_2": "When an external electric field is applied to a graphene sheet, its electronic band structure changes due to the Stark effect. The Stark effect refers to the shifting and splitting of the energy levels of atoms and molecules in the presence of an external electric field. In the case of graphene, the effect is particularly interesting due to its unique electronic properties, such as its linear energy dispersion relation and the presence of Dirac cones.\n\nGraphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, and its electronic band structure exhibits a linear dispersion relation near the K and K' points in the Brillouin zone, where the conduction and valence bands touch each other, forming Dirac cones. This linear dispersion relation gives rise to the massless Dirac fermion behavior of the charge carriers in graphene.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet, the energy levels of the electrons in the graphene lattice are affected. The electric field induces a potential difference across the graphene sheet, which modifies the electronic band structure. This modification can be understood as a change in the energy of the electrons due to the interaction with the electric field.\n\nThe main effects of the applied electric field on the electronic band structure of graphene are:\n\n1. Bandgap opening: The most significant effect of the external electric field is the opening of a bandgap at the Dirac points. In pristine graphene, the conduction and valence bands touch each other, and there is no bandgap. However, when an electric field is applied, a bandgap opens up, and the material transitions from a zero-gap semiconductor to a finite-gap semiconductor. This bandgap opening can be tuned by varying the strength of the applied electric field.\n\n2. Band shifting: The energy levels of the conduction and valence bands shift due to the interaction with the electric field. This shift can be either upwards or downwards, depending on the direction of the applied electric field and the position of the energy levels in the Brillouin zone.\n\n3. Band splitting: The applied electric field can also cause the energy bands to split into sub-bands. This splitting is a result of the Stark effect, where the energy levels of the electrons are perturbed by the electric field.\n\nThese changes in the electronic band structure of graphene under an external electric field can have significant implications for the electronic and transport properties of the material. For example, the opening of a bandgap can enable the use of graphene in electronic devices such as transistors and sensors, where a bandgap is essential for controlling the flow of charge carriers. Additionally, the tunability of the bandgap and other electronic properties by an external electric field can be exploited for designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices based on graphene."
