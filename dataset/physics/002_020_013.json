    "message_2": "To find the compressibility factor (Z) of a gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nZ = (PV) / (nRT)\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can do this using the molar mass and the mass of the gas:\n\nn = mass / molar mass\n\nWe are not given the mass of the gas, but we can find it using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nRearranging for mass:\n\nmass = (PV * molar mass) / (RT)\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\nP = 10 atm\nV = 5 L\nT = 200 K\nmolar mass = 28 g/mol\nR = 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) (ideal gas constant)\n\nmass = (10 atm * 5 L * 28 g/mol) / (0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 200 K)\n\nmass ≈ 85.4 g\n\nNow we can find the number of moles (n):\n\nn = 85.4 g / 28 g/mol\n\nn ≈ 3.05 mol\n\nNow we can find the compressibility factor (Z):\n\nZ = (PV) / (nRT)\n\nZ = (10 atm * 5 L) / (3.05 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 200 K)\n\nZ ≈ 1.02\n\nThe compressibility factor of the gas at the given conditions is approximately 1.02."
