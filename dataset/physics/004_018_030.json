    "message_2": "The gravitational redshift effect, also known as gravitational redshift or gravitational redshift of light, is a phenomenon that occurs when light or other electromagnetic radiation travels away from a massive object such as a planet or a star. Due to the influence of gravity, the wavelength of the light gets stretched, causing it to shift towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This shift in wavelength corresponds to a decrease in frequency and energy of the photons.\n\nGravitational redshift is a direct consequence of General Relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. When light travels through a gravitational field, it follows the curvature of spacetime, and its energy and frequency change as it moves through regions of different gravitational potential.\n\nTo calculate the frequency shift of a photon emitted from the surface of the Earth when it reaches a distance of 6,371 km above the surface, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔΦ/c²)\n\nWhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, ΔΦ is the difference in gravitational potential, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in gravitational potential. The gravitational potential at a distance r from a mass M is given by:\n\nΦ = -GM/r\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the Earth (5.97 x 10²⁴ kg), and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nFor the surface of the Earth, r₁ = 6,371,000 m (the Earth's radius). For a distance of 6,371 km above the surface, r₂ = 6,371,000 m + 6,371,000 m = 12,742,000 m.\n\nNow, we can find the difference in gravitational potential:\n\nΔΦ = Φ₂ - Φ₁ = (-GM/r₂) - (-GM/r₁)\n\nΔΦ = GM(1/r₁ - 1/r₂)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔΦ = (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5.97 x 10²⁴ kg)(1/6,371,000 m - 1/12,742,000 m)\n\nΔΦ ≈ 6.25 x 10⁻² J/kg\n\nNow, we can find the frequency shift:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔΦ/c²)\n\nΔf/f ≈ (6.25 x 10⁻² J/kg) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)²\n\nΔf/f ≈ 6.94 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nThis means that the fractional change in frequency is approximately 6.94 x 10⁻¹⁰. To find the actual change in frequency, you would need to know the initial frequency of the photon. Multiply the initial frequency by this fractional change to obtain the frequency shift."
