    "message_1": "A container holds a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases with a total pressure of 1 atm. The mole fraction of nitrogen in the mixture is 0.2. Calculate the fugacity of nitrogen in the mixture at standard temperature and pressure (STP).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of nitrogen in the mixture, we can use the following equation:\n\nfugacity = mole_fraction * partial_pressure\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial pressure of nitrogen in the mixture. We can do this by multiplying the total pressure by the mole fraction of nitrogen:\n\npartial_pressure_N2 = total_pressure * mole_fraction_N2\npartial_pressure_N2 = 1 atm * 0.2\npartial_pressure_N2 = 0.2 atm\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity of nitrogen in the mixture:\n\nfugacity_N2 = mole_fraction_N2 * partial_pressure_N2\nfugacity_N2 = 0.2 * 0.2 atm\nfugacity_N2 = 0.04 atm\n\nSo, the fugacity of nitrogen in the mixture at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 0.04 atm."
