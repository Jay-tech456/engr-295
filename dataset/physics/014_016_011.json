    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outer space, primarily composed of protons, electrons, and atomic nuclei. When these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere, they produce secondary particles, including neutrons and muons, which can reach the surface. In space, astronauts are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation due to the lack of Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetic field.\n\nThe effects of cosmic rays on the human body can be divided into two categories: short-term and long-term effects.\n\nShort-term effects:\n1. Acute radiation sickness: High doses of cosmic radiation can cause acute radiation sickness, characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and skin burns. However, this is rare and usually occurs only in extreme cases, such as solar particle events.\n\n2. Central nervous system effects: High-energy particles can penetrate the skull and interact with brain tissue, potentially causing cognitive impairments, memory loss, and other neurological effects.\n\nLong-term effects:\n1. Cancer risk: Cosmic radiation can cause damage to DNA, which may lead to mutations and an increased risk of developing cancer. Long-term exposure to cosmic radiation, especially in space, can significantly increase the risk of developing various types of cancer, including leukemia and solid tumors.\n\n2. Cataracts: Cosmic radiation can cause damage to the lens of the eye, leading to the development of cataracts over time.\n\n3. Cardiovascular diseases: Some studies suggest that long-term exposure to cosmic radiation may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases due to damage to the endothelial cells lining blood vessels.\n\n4. Hereditary effects: Although not yet fully understood, there is a possibility that cosmic radiation-induced DNA damage may lead to hereditary effects in the offspring of exposed individuals.\n\nIn space, astronauts are at a higher risk of experiencing these health effects due to the increased levels of cosmic radiation. To mitigate these risks, spacecraft are designed with radiation shielding, and missions are planned to limit the duration of exposure. Additionally, researchers are working on developing advanced shielding materials and studying the biological effects of cosmic radiation to better protect astronauts during long-duration space missions.\n\nOn Earth, the atmosphere and magnetic field provide substantial protection against cosmic radiation, so the health risks are significantly lower. However, certain populations, such as aircrew members and frequent flyers, may be exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation and should be aware of the potential long-term health risks."
