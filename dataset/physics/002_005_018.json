    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) of the gas during an isothermal process, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = Q/T\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed by the gas and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nHowever, we are not given the temperature in the problem. We can use the ideal gas law to relate the temperature to the given information:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant. Therefore, we can write the ideal gas law for the initial and final states:\n\nP1V1 = nRT1\nP2V2 = nRT2\n\nSince T1 = T2, we can equate the two expressions:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nWe are given the initial volume (V1 = 2.0 L) and the final volume (V2 = 4.0 L). We are not given the pressures, but we can express the ratio of the pressures as follows:\n\nP1/P2 = V2/V1\n\nNow, we can use the heat absorbed (Q = 1,500 J) and the relationship between the pressures and volumes to find the entropy change:\n\nΔS = Q/T = (nRΔ(ln(P1/P2)) = nRΔ(ln(V2/V1))\n\nWe don't have the value of n, but we can still find the entropy change per mole:\n\nΔS/n = RΔ(ln(V2/V1))\n\nUsing the ideal gas constant R = 8.314 J/(mol·K):\n\nΔS/n = 8.314 * (ln(4.0/2.0))\n\nΔS/n = 8.314 * ln(2)\n\nΔS/n ≈ 5.76 J/(mol·K)\n\nThe entropy change per mole of the gas during the isothermal process is approximately 5.76 J/(mol·K)."
