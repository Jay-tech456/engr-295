    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between two heat reservoirs at temperatures 400 K and 300 K. If the heat input to the engine is 1000 J, find the maximum work output and the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum work output and the Carnot efficiency of the engine, we can use the following formulas:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\nMaximum work output = Carnot efficiency * Heat input\n\nwhere T_cold and T_hot are the temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 400 K) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum work output:\n\nMaximum work output = 0.25 * 1000 J = 250 J\n\nSo, the maximum work output of the engine is 250 J, and the Carnot efficiency is 0.25 or 25%."
