    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the total mass of the system, ω is the angular frequency, r is the distance from the observer to the system, and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the system in kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 25 solar masses = 25 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 4.9725 x 10^31 kg\nM = M1 + M2 = 5.967 x 10^31 kg + 4.9725 x 10^31 kg = 10.9395 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency ω. The orbital frequency is given as 40 Hz, so:\n\nω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 40 Hz = 80π rad/s\n\nNow, we need to know the distance r from the observer to the system. Since this information is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact amplitude of the gravitational wave. However, we can express the amplitude in terms of the distance r:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nh = (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 10.9395 x 10^31 kg * (80π rad/s)² * r) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)⁴\n\nh ≈ (1.455 x 10^-21 * r) m\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational wave is approximately 1.455 x 10^-21 times the distance from the observer to the system in meters."
