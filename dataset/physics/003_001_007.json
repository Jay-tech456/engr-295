    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance r from a straight wire carrying a current I, we can use Ampere's Law, specifically the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field B at a distance r from a straight wire carrying a current I is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 3.5 A and the distance r = 6.0 cm = 0.06 m, we can now calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.06 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3.5 A) / (2 * 0.06 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB ≈ (1.4 × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.12 m\n\nB ≈ 1.166 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 6.0 cm from the wire is approximately 1.166 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
