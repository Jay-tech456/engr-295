    "message_2": "1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. According to Newtonian gravity, the velocity of stars orbiting the galactic center should decrease as their distance from the center increases. However, observations show that the velocities of stars remain relatively constant at large distances from the galactic center, suggesting the presence of an unseen mass that provides additional gravitational force. This unseen mass is attributed to dark matter, which is hypothesized to be composed of particles that do not interact with light but do exert gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Gravitational lensing is the bending of light by massive objects, as predicted by general relativity. Observations of gravitational lensing around galaxy clusters reveal that the total mass of the cluster, as inferred from the lensing effect, is much greater than the mass of visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) within the cluster. This discrepancy suggests the presence of dark matter, composed of particles that do not emit or absorb light but contribute to the overall mass and gravitational force of the cluster.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations (anisotropies) provide information about the composition and evolution of the universe. Observations of the CMB anisotropies, particularly from the Planck satellite, indicate that about 26% of the universe's energy density is composed of dark matter. Theoretical models of the universe's evolution, which include dark matter particles, are consistent with the observed CMB anisotropies, providing further support for the particle nature of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter particles. Simulations of cosmic structure formation that include dark matter particles can reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the universe, with dark matter providing the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In contrast, modified theories of gravity struggle to reproduce the observed large-scale structure without invoking dark matter particles.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, which provides a unique opportunity to study the behavior of dark matter. Observations of the Bullet Cluster show that the majority of the mass, as determined by gravitational lensing, is spatially separated from the hot gas, which is the primary component of visible matter in galaxy clusters. This separation suggests that dark matter particles, which do not interact strongly with normal matter or themselves, have passed through the collision relatively unimpeded, while the hot gas has been slowed down by its interactions. This observation supports the particle nature of dark matter over modified theories of gravity."
