    "message_2": "The expected mass range for the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is not fixed, as it depends on the specific parameters of the model. However, it is generally expected to be in the range of a few GeV (gigaelectronvolts) to a few TeV (teraelectronvolts). The LSP is typically assumed to be a neutralino, which is a mixture of the supersymmetric partners of the neutral gauge bosons (photino, zino) and neutral Higgs bosons (higgsinos).\n\nDetection of the LSP in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is challenging due to its expected weak interactions with ordinary matter and its neutral nature, making it difficult to directly observe. However, the LSP can be detected indirectly through the production and decay of heavier supersymmetric particles. These heavier particles would decay into the LSP and other Standard Model particles, leading to a characteristic pattern of missing energy and momentum in the detector, which can be attributed to the undetected LSP.\n\nThe LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, search for supersymmetric particles by looking for events with large amounts of missing transverse energy, along with other specific signatures such as multiple high-energy jets, leptons, or photons. If an excess of such events is observed compared to the predictions from the Standard Model, it could be a sign of supersymmetry and the LSP. So far, no clear evidence for supersymmetry has been found at the LHC, which has led to increasingly stringent constraints on the masses and properties of supersymmetric particles, including the LSP."
