    "message_2": "The correlation between the massive gravitational pull of a black hole and the formation of quasars lies in the process of accretion of matter around the black hole. Quasars are extremely bright and energetic objects found in the centers of some galaxies. They emit enormous amounts of energy, primarily in the form of light, X-rays, and gamma rays.\n\nAt the center of a quasar, there is a supermassive black hole, which is millions to billions of times more massive than our Sun. The massive gravitational pull of the black hole attracts surrounding gas, dust, and other matter, forming an accretion disk around it. As the matter in the accretion disk spirals towards the black hole, it gets compressed and heated to extremely high temperatures, causing it to emit large amounts of radiation.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the accretion disk is what makes quasars so bright and detectable from great distances. The energy output of a quasar is mainly due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy of the infalling matter into radiation. This process is highly efficient, with up to 10% of the rest mass energy of the infalling matter being converted into radiation, compared to only about 0.7% for nuclear fusion in stars.\n\nIn summary, the massive gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole is responsible for the formation of an accretion disk, which in turn leads to the emission of large amounts of radiation, giving rise to the phenomenon of quasars. The correlation between the two is a direct result of the black hole's strong gravitational influence on its surrounding environment."
