    "message_2": "To determine the angle at which the first minimum is observed on the screen, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere:\nθ is the angle at which the minimum is observed\nm is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum)\nλ is the wavelength of the light\na is the width of the slit\n\nWe are given the width of the slit (a = 0.02 mm = 0.02 * 10^(-3) m) and the distance between the slit and the screen (2 meters). However, we don't have the wavelength of the light (λ). Since we cannot determine the angle without the wavelength, we can only express the angle in terms of the wavelength:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * λ) / (0.02 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nTo find the angle θ, you can take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin((λ) / (0.02 * 10^(-3) m))\n\nSo, the angle at which the first minimum is observed on the screen depends on the wavelength of the monochromatic light beam."
