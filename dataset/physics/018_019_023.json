    "message_2": "The production rate of top quarks in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is directly related to the collision energy. As the collision energy increases, the production rate of top quarks also increases.\n\nThis is because the production of top quarks is a result of strong interactions between the quarks and gluons inside the colliding protons. The probability of producing top quarks is determined by the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding protons and the strong interaction cross-sections.\n\nWhen the collision energy increases, the available phase space for producing top quarks also increases. This means that there are more possible ways for the quarks and gluons inside the protons to interact and produce top quarks. Consequently, the production rate of top quarks increases with increasing collision energy.\n\nAdditionally, higher collision energies allow for the production of heavier particles, such as top quarks, which have a mass of about 173 GeV/cÂ². The production threshold for top quark-antiquark pairs is around 346 GeV, so increasing the collision energy above this threshold significantly enhances the production rate of top quarks.\n\nIn summary, the production rate of top quarks in proton-proton collisions at the LHC increases with increasing collision energy due to the increased phase space and the ability to produce heavier particles like top quarks."
