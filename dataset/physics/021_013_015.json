    "message_2": "A black hole's gravitational lensing can have a significant effect on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Gravitational lensing occurs when the mass of a massive object, like a black hole, bends the path of light or other electromagnetic radiation as it passes nearby. This bending of light can cause the observed position, shape, and intensity of the CMB radiation to be distorted.\n\nThe effect of a black hole's gravitational lensing on the CMB radiation depends on the size (mass) of the black hole. The larger the mass of the black hole, the stronger its gravitational field, and the greater the degree of lensing. This means that the distortion of the CMB radiation will be more significant for larger black holes.\n\nThe degree of lensing can be quantified using the Einstein radius, which is a measure of the angular separation between the true position of a background source (in this case, the CMB radiation) and its lensed image. The Einstein radius is directly proportional to the square root of the mass of the black hole. Therefore, as the mass of the black hole increases, the Einstein radius and the degree of lensing also increase.\n\nIn summary, the effect of a black hole's gravitational lensing on the cosmic microwave background radiation is to distort its observed position, shape, and intensity. The size (mass) of the black hole determines the degree of lensing, with larger black holes causing more significant distortions."
