    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of a cylindrical wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nFor a long, straight wire, the magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire, and its magnitude can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (3 A), and r is the distance from the center of the wire (5 cm or 0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^-7 Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 120π × 10^-7 T\n\nB ≈ 3.77 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the cylindrical wire is approximately 3.77 × 10^-5 T (Tesla)."
