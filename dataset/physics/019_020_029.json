    "message_2": "The calculation of correlation functions in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory using the superconformal symmetry of the theory involves several steps. Here, we outline the general procedure and discuss the behavior of these correlation functions in both weak and strong coupling limits.\n\n1. Identify the operators: First, identify the local operators in the N=4 SYM theory that transform under the superconformal group. These operators are typically gauge-invariant and built from the fundamental fields of the theory (scalars, fermions, and gauge fields).\n\n2. Apply superconformal Ward identities: Use the superconformal Ward identities to constrain the form of the correlation functions. These identities arise from the invariance of the correlation functions under the superconformal transformations. They help to reduce the number of independent tensor structures and simplify the calculation.\n\n3. Apply the superconformal bootstrap: The superconformal bootstrap is a powerful technique that exploits the constraints from the superconformal symmetry to determine the correlation functions. This involves solving the crossing equations and finding the operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients and conformal dimensions of the operators.\n\n4. Analytic continuation: In some cases, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to obtain the correlation functions in the desired kinematic regime.\n\n5. Perturbative calculations: In the weak coupling limit (small 't Hooft coupling λ), one can use perturbation theory to compute the correlation functions. This involves expanding the correlation functions in a power series in the coupling constant and calculating the Feynman diagrams order by order.\n\n6. Non-perturbative techniques: In the strong coupling limit (large λ), perturbation theory is not applicable. Instead, one can use non-perturbative techniques such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates N=4 SYM theory to a dual string theory in a higher-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows for the calculation of correlation functions using the techniques of string theory and holography.\n\nIn summary, the mathematical procedure for calculating correlation functions in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the superconformal symmetry involves identifying the relevant operators, applying superconformal Ward identities and the superconformal bootstrap, and using perturbative or non-perturbative techniques depending on the coupling regime. The behavior of these correlation functions depends on the coupling strength, with perturbation theory being applicable in the weak coupling limit and non-perturbative techniques like AdS/CFT being useful in the strong coupling limit."
