    "message_1": "A student is exploring the concept of Total Internal Reflection and would like to design an optical fiber that can transmit light from one end to another end using the principle of Total Internal Reflection. The student has a light source with an intensity of 2 mW and a fiber optic cable with a refractive index of 1.5. The cable has a length of 10 meters and a diameter of 0.5mm. What is the minimum angle of incidence at which total internal reflection occurs in the fiber optic cable?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we first need to determine the critical angle. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the fiber optic cable (1.5), n2 is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (air, with a refractive index of approximately 1), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nSince we want to find the critical angle, we set θ2 = 90 degrees:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection in the fiber optic cable is approximately 41.81 degrees."
