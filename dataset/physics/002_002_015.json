    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for a physics student to solve related to the topic of heat transfer:\n\nA metal block weighing 1 kg is initially at a temperature of 100 ℃. It is placed in contact with a reservoir of boiling water at 100 ℃. The specific heat capacity of the metal is 0.4 J/g.℃ and the latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 J/g. What is the total heat transferred to the block of metal if all of the water boils away and the metal reaches the temperature of the water?",
    "message_2": "Since the metal block is initially at the same temperature as the boiling water (100 ℃), there is no temperature difference between the two, and therefore no heat transfer due to a temperature difference. The only heat transfer that occurs is due to the phase change of the water from liquid to vapor.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not provide the mass of the water that boils away. Without this information, we cannot calculate the total heat transferred to the metal block. If the mass of the water is provided, we can use the following formula to calculate the heat transfer:\n\nQ = m_water * L_vaporization\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m_water is the mass of the water, and L_vaporization is the latent heat of vaporization of water."
