    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 500 lines per millimeter and is illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm. If the angle between the first order and the second order spectrum is 40 degrees, what is the distance between the slits?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the slits, we first need to determine the grating spacing (d). Since there are 500 lines per millimeter, we can convert this to meters:\n\n500 lines/mm * (1 m / 1000 mm) = 500,000 lines/m\n\nNow, we can find the grating spacing (d) by taking the reciprocal of the number of lines per meter:\n\nd = 1 / 500,000 lines/m = 2 x 10^-6 m\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the angles for the first and second order spectra:\n\nmλ = d * sin(θ)\n\nFor the first order (m = 1):\n\n1 * (500 x 10^-9 m) = (2 x 10^-6 m) * sin(θ1)\n\nSolving for θ1:\n\nθ1 = arcsin((500 x 10^-9 m) / (2 x 10^-6 m)) = arcsin(0.25) ≈ 14.48°\n\nFor the second order (m = 2):\n\n2 * (500 x 10^-9 m) = (2 x 10^-6 m) * sin(θ2)\n\nSolving for θ2:\n\nθ2 = arcsin((1000 x 10^-9 m) / (2 x 10^-6 m)) = arcsin(0.5) ≈ 30.00°\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the first and second order spectra:\n\nΔθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 30.00° - 14.48° ≈ 15.52°\n\nHowever, the problem states that the angle between the first and second order spectra is 40 degrees. This discrepancy indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the given values. Nonetheless, the distance between the slits (grating spacing) is 2 x 10^-6 m."
