A beam of light is emitted from the spaceship at an angle of 60 degrees to the direction of motion. What angle will the observer on Earth see the beam of light as? Use the concept of relativistic aberration of light to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of relativistic aberration of light. The formula for relativistic aberration is given by:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) / (γ(cos(θ) + β)))\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the light beam in the spaceship's frame, θ' is the angle of the light beam in the observer's frame, β is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity to the speed of light (v/c), and γ is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the spaceship is moving at a constant velocity of 0.9c relative to an observer on Earth, so β = 0.9. The angle of the light beam in the spaceship's frame is 60 degrees, so θ = 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor, γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration to find the angle θ':\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) / (γ(cos(θ) + β)))\ntan(θ') = (sin(60°) / (2.294(cos(60°) + 0.9)))\n\nWe know that sin(60°) = sqrt(3)/2 and cos(60°) = 1/2, so:\n\ntan(θ') = (sqrt(3)/2) / (2.294(1/2 + 0.9))\ntan(θ') = (sqrt(3)/2) / (2.294(1.4))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of tan(θ'):\n\ntan(θ') ≈ 0.384\n\nTo find the angle θ', we take the arctangent of the value we just calculated:\n\nθ' ≈ arctan(0.384)\nθ' ≈ 21.1°\n\nSo, the observer on Earth will see the beam of light at an angle of approximately 21.1 degrees to the direction of motion of the spaceship."
