    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the amount of force produced by a muscle during a contraction, given the muscle's cross-sectional area and the tension it is able to generate. The student also needs to calculate the work done by the muscle during a single contraction, assuming a constant force is produced throughout the contraction.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of force produced by a muscle during a contraction, the student can use the following formula:\n\nForce (F) = Tension (T) × Cross-sectional area (A)\n\nwhere Tension is the tension generated by the muscle and Cross-sectional area is the area of the muscle.\n\nOnce the student has calculated the force, they can proceed to calculate the work done by the muscle during a single contraction. The formula for work done is:\n\nWork (W) = Force (F) × Distance (d)\n\nwhere Force is the force produced by the muscle (calculated in the previous step) and Distance is the distance over which the muscle contracts.\n\nAssuming a constant force is produced throughout the contraction, the student can simply multiply the calculated force by the distance the muscle contracts to find the work done by the muscle during a single contraction."
