    "message_2": "The thermal conductivity of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, is known to be exceptionally high. It is one of the best thermal conductors known, with values ranging from 3000 to 5000 W/mK at room temperature. However, the thermal conductivity of graphene is not a constant value and can vary with temperature.\n\nAt low temperatures, the thermal conductivity of graphene is dominated by phonons, which are quasiparticles representing the collective vibrations of atoms in the lattice. In this regime, the thermal conductivity typically increases with temperature. This is because, as the temperature increases, more phonons are excited, leading to a higher rate of heat transfer.\n\nAs the temperature increases further, the thermal conductivity of graphene starts to decrease. This is due to the increased scattering of phonons at higher temperatures, which reduces their mean free path and, consequently, the overall thermal conductivity. This behavior is consistent with the Umklapp scattering process, where phonons with large wavevectors are scattered into phonons with smaller wavevectors, leading to a reduction in heat transport.\n\nIn summary, the thermal conductivity of graphene varies with temperature, generally increasing at low temperatures and decreasing at higher temperatures. The exact relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature depends on factors such as the quality of the graphene sample, the presence of defects, and the level of doping."
