    "message_2": "The minimum number of photons required to activate a single rod cell in the human eye is around 5-14 photons. This is because rod cells are extremely sensitive to light, and they can respond to a single photon under ideal conditions. However, due to the noise in the system and the fact that not every photon is absorbed by the photopigment, it takes a few more photons to ensure a reliable response. \n\nThe threshold for light detection by rod cells is significantly lower than that of cone cells. Rod cells are responsible for vision in low-light conditions (scotopic vision) and are more sensitive to light than cone cells. Cone cells, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision and function best in well-lit conditions (photopic vision). Cone cells require more photons to activate, which is why they are less sensitive to light than rod cells. This difference in sensitivity allows the human eye to function effectively in a wide range of lighting conditions."
