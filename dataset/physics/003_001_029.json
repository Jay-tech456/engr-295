    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 2 A, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire (0.05 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T (tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the orientation of the wire and the direction of the current."
