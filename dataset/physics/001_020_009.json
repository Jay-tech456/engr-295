    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), renormalization is a technique used to remove infinities that arise in the calculations of physical observables. The renormalization constants for the QED coupling constant and electron self-energy are crucial in this process.\n\nThe renormalization constants are denoted as Z1, Z2, and Z3, and they are related to the renormalized quantities as follows:\n\n1. Z1: This constant is associated with the vertex function renormalization. It relates the bare vertex function (unrenormalized) to the renormalized vertex function.\n\n2. Z2: This constant is associated with the electron self-energy renormalization. It relates the bare electron propagator (unrenormalized) to the renormalized electron propagator. The renormalized electron mass (m) is related to the bare electron mass (m_0) by m = Z2^(1/2) * m_0.\n\n3. Z3: This constant is associated with the photon self-energy renormalization. It relates the bare photon propagator (unrenormalized) to the renormalized photon propagator.\n\nThe renormalization constants affect the calculation of physical observables such as the electromagnetic fine structure constant (α) and electron mass (m) by removing the infinities that arise in the calculations. The renormalized coupling constant (e) is related to the bare coupling constant (e_0) by e = Z3^(-1/2) * e_0. The renormalized fine structure constant (α) is given by α = e^2 / (4πε_0ħc), where e is the renormalized coupling constant.\n\nIn summary, the renormalization constants Z1, Z2, and Z3 play a crucial role in the renormalization process in QED. They help to remove the infinities that arise in the calculations of physical observables, such as the electromagnetic fine structure constant and electron mass, by relating the bare (unrenormalized) quantities to the renormalized quantities."
