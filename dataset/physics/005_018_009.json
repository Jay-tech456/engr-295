    "message_2": "The equation for the relativistic energy of a particle in terms of its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) is given by the following equation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the particle, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nThis equation can be derived from the more general equation for the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = m²c⁴ + p²c²\n\nNow, let's relate this equation to the non-relativistic energy equation. The non-relativistic energy equation is given by:\n\nE = K + mc²\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy of the particle, and mc² is the rest energy of the particle. The kinetic energy in non-relativistic mechanics is given by:\n\nK = (1/2)mv²\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. In the non-relativistic limit, the velocity of the particle is much smaller than the speed of light (v << c). In this case, the momentum of the particle can be approximated as:\n\np = mv\n\nNow, we can rewrite the relativistic energy equation in terms of the kinetic energy:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)² = (mc²)² + (mvc)² = (mc²)² + (2mc²K)\n\nExpanding the equation and taking the square root, we get:\n\nE = mc² + K + (1/2)(K²/mc²) + ...\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit, the higher-order terms (like K²/mc²) are negligible compared to the first two terms. Therefore, we can approximate the relativistic energy equation as:\n\nE ≈ mc² + K\n\nwhich is the same as the non-relativistic energy equation."
