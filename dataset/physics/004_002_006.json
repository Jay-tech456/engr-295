    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In other words, it is the point of no return, where the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape. The properties of the event horizon are closely related to the mass and spin of the black hole.\n\n1. Size: The size of the event horizon is determined by the black hole's mass. The radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, is given by the formula:\n\n   Rs = 2GM/c^2\n\n   where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. As the mass of the black hole increases, the size of the event horizon also increases.\n\n2. Shape: The shape of the event horizon depends on the black hole's spin. A non-spinning (or Schwarzschild) black hole has a spherical event horizon. However, a spinning (or Kerr) black hole has an oblate spheroidal event horizon, which is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to the black hole's rotation.\n\n3. Ergosphere: For a spinning black hole, there is a region outside the event horizon called the ergosphere. In this region, spacetime is dragged along with the black hole's rotation, forcing objects to move in the same direction as the black hole's spin. The boundary of the ergosphere is called the \"static limit,\" and it is closer to the black hole at the poles and farther away at the equator.\n\n4. Gravitational redshift: As light or other signals try to escape the strong gravitational field near the event horizon, they experience a redshift, meaning their wavelengths become longer and their energy decreases. This effect is more pronounced as the object emitting the signal gets closer to the event horizon.\n\nIn summary, the properties of the event horizon of a black hole, such as its size, shape, and the presence of an ergosphere, are closely related to the black hole's mass and spin. These properties have significant implications for the behavior of matter and energy near the black hole and the potential extraction of energy from the black hole through processes like the Penrose process."
