    "message_2": "The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in explaining the observed rotation curves of galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity of stars should decrease as we move away from the center of the galaxy, similar to how planets in our solar system obey Kepler's laws. However, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show a different behavior.\n\nObservations of spiral galaxies, such as the Andromeda galaxy and our own Milky Way, have shown that the rotation curves remain relatively flat or even slightly increase with increasing distance from the center. This implies that there is more mass present in the outer regions of the galaxy than can be accounted for by the visible stars and gas. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter is known as the galaxy rotation problem.\n\nDark matter, a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, is believed to be the key to solving this problem. The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies can explain the observed flat rotation curves. Dark matter is thought to form a halo around galaxies, with its mass distribution extending well beyond the visible matter. The gravitational influence of this dark matter halo on the normal matter in the galaxy leads to the observed flat rotation curves.\n\nTheoretical models, such as the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model, have been developed to describe the large-scale structure of the universe, including the distribution of dark matter. These models predict the formation of dark matter halos around galaxies, which is consistent with the observed rotation curves. Moreover, simulations based on these models have been successful in reproducing the observed large-scale structure of the universe, providing further evidence for the presence of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between dark matter and normal matter affects the rotation curve of galaxies by providing additional mass in the outer regions of the galaxy, leading to the observed flat rotation curves. Observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, along with theoretical models such as the ΛCDM model, provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and its influence on the dynamics of galaxies."
