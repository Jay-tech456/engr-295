    "message_2": "The maximum angular scale at which the acoustic oscillations can be detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is related to the size of the sound horizon at the time of recombination. The sound horizon is the maximum distance that sound waves can travel in the early universe before the CMB photons decouple from the baryonic matter.\n\nThe angular scale of the sound horizon can be determined using the angular diameter distance formula:\n\nθ = s / d_A\n\nwhere θ is the angular scale, s is the physical size of the sound horizon, and d_A is the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering.\n\nThe sound horizon at the time of recombination is approximately 150 Mpc (megaparsecs). The angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering is about 14,000 Mpc. Using these values, we can calculate the maximum angular scale at which the acoustic oscillations can be detected in the CMB:\n\nθ = (150 Mpc) / (14,000 Mpc) ≈ 0.01 radians ≈ 0.57 degrees\n\nThis angular scale corresponds to the first peak in the CMB power spectrum, which is related to the largest structures in the universe that were formed by the acoustic oscillations.\n\nNow, let's relate this to the size of the visible universe. The radius of the observable universe is about 46.5 billion light-years, or approximately 14.3 billion parsecs (Gpc). The sound horizon at recombination, 150 Mpc, is a small fraction of the size of the visible universe:\n\n(150 Mpc) / (14,300,000 Mpc) ≈ 1.05 x 10^(-5)\n\nThis means that the maximum angular scale of the acoustic oscillations in the CMB is related to structures that are about 0.001% the size of the visible universe. These structures are the seeds of the large-scale structure we observe today, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters."
