    "message_1": "A disc of radius 0.1 m carries a current of 3 A uniformly distributed over its surface. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field, in tesla, at a point 0.2 m above the center of the disc?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point above the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the surface, we need to first find the current density (J) and then integrate over the entire disc.\n\nThe area of the disc is A = πr² = π(0.1 m)² = 0.01π m². The total current is 3 A, so the current density J = I/A = 3 A / 0.01π m² = 300/π A/m².\n\nNow, let's consider a small ring of radius r and thickness dr on the disc. The area of this ring is dA = 2πr dr. The current in this ring is dI = J dA = (300/π) * 2πr dr = 600r dr A.\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart law for a circular loop, the magnetic field dB at a point P (0.2 m above the center) due to this small ring is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * r) / (4π * (r² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), r is the radius of the ring, z is the distance above the center (0.2 m), and dI is the current in the ring.\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = 0.1 m):\n\nB = ∫(dB) = ∫[(μ₀ * dI * r) / (4π * (r² + z²)^(3/2))] dr from 0 to 0.1\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[(600r² dr) / (r² + 0.04)^(3/2)] from 0 to 0.1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let x = r² + 0.04, then 2r dr = dx:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 8π) * ∫[(600 dx) / x^(3/2)] from x = 0.04 to x = 0.05\n\nB = (μ₀ / 8π) * [(-1200) * x^(-1/2)] from 0.04 to 0.05\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀ and the limits of integration:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 8π) * [(-1200) * (0.05^(-1/2) - 0.04^(-1/2))]\n\nB ≈ 1.34 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m above the center of the disc is approximately 1.34 × 10^(-5) tesla."
