    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a free particle is given by the Klein-Gordon equation, which is:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (mc/ħ)²)ψ(r, t) = 0\n\nwhere ψ(r, t) is the wave function of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nTo solve this equation for a free particle with momentum p, we can use the plane wave solution:\n\nψ(r, t) = A * exp(i(k * r - ω * t))\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave vector, r is the position vector, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is given by:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle and p is its momentum. We can rewrite this relation in terms of the wave vector k and angular frequency ω:\n\n(ħω)² = (ħck)² + (mc²)²\n\nNow, we can express the wave vector k and angular frequency ω in terms of the momentum p and mass m:\n\nk = p/ħ\nω = E/ħ\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the plane wave solution, we get:\n\nψ(r, t) = A * exp(i(p * r/ħ - E * t/ħ))\n\nThis is the solution of the relativistic wave equation for a free particle with mass m and momentum p."
