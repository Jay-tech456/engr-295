    "message_1": "A physics student is tasked with calculating the Coriolis force that acts on a water particle moving in the Southern Hemisphere with a velocity of 2 meters per second at a latitude of 40 degrees South. How much force is acting on the particle due to the Coriolis effect?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Coriolis force acting on the water particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nF_c = 2 * m * v * ω * sin(φ)\n\nwhere:\nF_c is the Coriolis force\nm is the mass of the water particle\nv is the velocity of the water particle (2 m/s)\nω is the Earth's angular velocity (approximately 7.292 x 10^-5 rad/s)\nφ is the latitude (40 degrees South, which is -40 degrees)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the latitude from degrees to radians:\n\nφ = -40 * (π/180) = -0.698 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula. However, we don't have the mass of the water particle. Since the Coriolis force is proportional to the mass, we can calculate the force per unit mass:\n\nF_c/m = 2 * v * ω * sin(φ)\n\nF_c/m = 2 * 2 m/s * 7.292 x 10^-5 rad/s * sin(-0.698 radians)\n\nF_c/m ≈ -1.57 x 10^-4 N/kg\n\nSo, the Coriolis force acting on the water particle per unit mass is approximately -1.57 x 10^-4 N/kg. To find the actual force, you would need to know the mass of the water particle and multiply it by this value."
