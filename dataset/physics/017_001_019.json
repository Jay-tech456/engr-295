    "message_2": "When doping is introduced into a semiconductor, the electronic band structure changes in a way that either increases the number of free electrons (n-type doping) or increases the number of holes (p-type doping), thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity of the material.\n\nIn an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor, the valence band is completely filled with electrons, and the conduction band is empty at absolute zero temperature. The energy gap between these two bands is called the bandgap, and it determines the semiconductor's electrical properties. At room temperature, a small number of electrons gain enough thermal energy to jump from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind holes in the valence band. These electrons and holes are responsible for the intrinsic conductivity of the semiconductor.\n\nWhen doping is introduced, impurity atoms with either more or fewer valence electrons than the semiconductor atoms are added to the material. This alters the electronic band structure in the following ways:\n\n1. n-type doping: In this case, donor impurity atoms with one more valence electron than the semiconductor atoms are added. These impurities create additional energy levels near the conduction band. When thermal energy is provided, electrons from these donor levels can easily jump into the conduction band, increasing the number of free electrons and thus the conductivity of the material. The Fermi level, which represents the highest energy level occupied by electrons at absolute zero, shifts closer to the conduction band.\n\n2. p-type doping: Here, acceptor impurity atoms with one fewer valence electron than the semiconductor atoms are added. These impurities create additional energy levels near the valence band. Electrons from the valence band can easily jump into these acceptor levels, leaving behind holes in the valence band. This increases the number of holes and thus the conductivity of the material. In this case, the Fermi level shifts closer to the valence band.\n\nIn summary, doping a semiconductor introduces new energy levels within the bandgap and shifts the Fermi level, resulting in an increase in the number of free electrons or holes, which in turn enhances the electrical conductivity of the material."
