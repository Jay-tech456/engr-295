    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in atomic spectra due to the presence of an external magnetic field. This effect occurs because the magnetic field interacts with the magnetic moment of the electron, causing the energy levels to split into multiple sublevels. The Zeeman effect can be classified into two types: normal Zeeman effect (when the electron spin is not considered) and anomalous Zeeman effect (when the electron spin is considered).\n\nTo calculate the shift in spectral lines, we can use the formula:\n\nΔE = m_j * e * B * Δm_l * Bohr magneton\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, m_j is the magnetic quantum number, e is the electron charge, B is the magnetic field strength, Δm_l is the change in the orbital magnetic quantum number, and Bohr magneton is the magnetic moment of an electron in its ground state (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T).\n\nFor the sodium atom, the 3p->3s transition corresponds to a change in the principal quantum number from n=3 to n=2. The 3p state has an orbital quantum number (l) of 1, and the 3s state has an orbital quantum number (l) of 0. The magnetic quantum number (m_l) can take values from -l to +l, so for the 3p state, m_l can be -1, 0, or +1.\n\nIn a magnetic field of 10 Tesla, we can calculate the energy shift for each m_l value:\n\nΔE(-1) = -1 * e * 10 * (-1) * Bohr magneton = 9.274 x 10^-23 J\nΔE(0) = 0 * e * 10 * 0 * Bohr magneton = 0 J\nΔE(+1) = +1 * e * 10 * (+1) * Bohr magneton = -9.274 x 10^-23 J\n\nThe energy levels are split into three sublevels with energy shifts of -9.274 x 10^-23 J, 0 J, and +9.274 x 10^-23 J.\n\nTo calculate the wavelength shift, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ = (ΔE * λ^2) / (h * c)\n\nwhere Δλ is the wavelength shift, λ is the initial wavelength of the transition, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe initial wavelength for the 3p->3s transition in sodium is approximately 589 nm (5.89 x 10^-7 m). We can calculate the wavelength shift for each energy shift:\n\nΔλ(-9.274 x 10^-23 J) = ((-9.274 x 10^-23 J) * (5.89 x 10^-7 m)^2) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) ≈ -2.91 x 10^-11 m\nΔλ(0 J) = 0 m\nΔλ(+9.274 x 10^-23 J) = ((9.274 x 10^-23 J) * (5.89 x 10^-7 m)^2) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) ≈ 2.91 x 10^-11 m\n\nThe wavelength shifts for the three sublevels are approximately -2.91 x 10^-11 m, 0 m, and +2.91 x 10^-11 m."
