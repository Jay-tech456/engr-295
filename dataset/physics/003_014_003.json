    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use Ampere's law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nFor a rectangular loop, we can break the loop into four segments, with each segment having a different distance (r) from the center of the loop. The magnetic field at the center of the loop will be the sum of the magnetic fields produced by each segment.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the rectangle as a (20 cm) and b (40 cm). The distances from the center of the loop to the middle of each segment are:\n\nr₁ = a/2 = 10 cm\nr₂ = b/2 = 20 cm\nr₃ = a/2 = 10 cm\nr₄ = b/2 = 20 cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by each segment:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₁)\nB₂ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₂)\nB₃ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₃)\nB₄ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₄)\n\nSince the coil has 10 turns, the total current enclosed by the loop is 10 * I. Therefore, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀ * 10I) / (2πr₁)\nB₂ = (μ₀ * 10I) / (2πr₂)\nB₃ = (μ₀ * 10I) / (2πr₃)\nB₄ = (μ₀ * 10I) / (2πr₄)\n\nThe total magnetic field at the center of the loop is the sum of the magnetic fields produced by each segment:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nI = 2 A\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 A) / (2π * 0.1 m) = 4 × 10^(-6) T\nB₂ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 A) / (2π * 0.2 m) = 2 × 10^(-6) T\nB₃ = B₁ = 4 × 10^(-6) T\nB₄ = B₂ = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄ = 4 × 10^(-6) T + 2 × 10^(-6) T + 4 × 10^(-6) T + 2 × 10^(-6) T = 12 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 12 × 10^(-6) T or 12 µT."
