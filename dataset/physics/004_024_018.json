Assume that the cosmic string is located 100 million light years away from Earth and that the gravitational waves propagate in a vacuum.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a cosmic string, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f) of gravitational waves emitted by a cosmic string:\n\nf ≈ (T/μ)^(1/2)\n\nwhere T is the tension of the cosmic string and μ is the linear mass density of the cosmic string.\n\n2. Amplitude (h) of gravitational waves emitted by a cosmic string:\n\nh ≈ (Gμ/c^2) * (L/d)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), L is the length of the cosmic string, and d is the distance from the cosmic string to Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the cosmic string. We can do this using the formula:\n\nμ = T/c^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nμ = (10^18 N) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nμ ≈ 1.11 x 10^10 kg/m\n\nNow we can calculate the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves:\n\nf ≈ (10^18 N / 1.11 x 10^10 kg/m)^(1/2)\nf ≈ (9.01 x 10^7 s^-2)^(1/2)\nf ≈ 3 x 10^3 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves:\n\nFirst, convert the distance from the cosmic string to Earth from light years to meters:\n\n100 million light years = 100 x 10^6 x 9.461 x 10^15 m ≈ 9.461 x 10^23 m\n\nNow, plug in the values into the formula:\n\nh ≈ (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.11 x 10^10 kg/m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * (10^21 m / 9.461 x 10^23 m)\nh ≈ (7.41 x 10^-1) * (1.06 x 10^-3)\nh ≈ 7.85 x 10^-4\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the cosmic string is approximately 3 x 10^3 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 7.85 x 10^-4."
