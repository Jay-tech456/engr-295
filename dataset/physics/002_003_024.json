    "message_2": "To calculate the change in internal energy of the gas, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states:\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nwhere ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the gas, and W is the work done by the gas.\n\nIn this case, Q = 400 Joules (heat added to the gas) and W = 300 Joules (work done by the gas).\n\nΔU = 400 J - 300 J = 100 J\n\nThe change in internal energy of the gas is 100 Joules."
