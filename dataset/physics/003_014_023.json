    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the loop has a rectangular shape, we need to divide the loop into four segments and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment separately. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields from all segments to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the segments as follows:\n1. Top segment (length 10 cm)\n2. Bottom segment (length 10 cm)\n3. Left segment (width 5 cm)\n4. Right segment (width 5 cm)\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the magnetic field at the center will be in the same direction (out of the plane), and their magnitudes will be equal. Similarly, for the left and right segments, the magnetic field at the center will be in the same direction (into the plane), and their magnitudes will be equal.\n\nWe can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire at a perpendicular distance R from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the distance from the wire.\n\nFor the top and bottom segments (length 10 cm), the distance R is half of the width, i.e., R = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m. For the left and right segments (width 5 cm), the distance R is half of the length, i.e., R = 5 cm = 0.05 m.\n\nCalculating the magnetic field for each segment:\n\nB_top_bottom = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.025 m) = 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\nB_left_right = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m) = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince the magnetic fields from the top and bottom segments are in the same direction, and the magnetic fields from the left and right segments are in the same direction, we can sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_total = B_top_bottom + B_left_right = 1.6 × 10^(-5) T + 8 × 10^(-6) T = 2.4 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular wire loop is 2.4 × 10^(-5) T."
