    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the gravitational wave, we can use the formula for the strain (h) of the wave, which is the ratio of the displacement of the mirrors (ΔL) to the length of the interferometer arms (L).\n\nh = ΔL / L\n\nThe length of the interferometer arms in LIGO is 4 km or 4,000 m. The displacement of the mirrors is given as 10^-18 m.\n\nh = (10^-18 m) / (4,000 m)\n\nh = 2.5 x 10^-22\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational wave is approximately 2.5 x 10^-22."
