    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the current-carrying transformer, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the distance from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a circular loop, we can simplify the Biot-Savart Law for our case. The magnetic field B at a point on the axis of a circular loop of radius R carrying a current I is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point P.\n\nIn our case, we have a single loop primary coil with a radius of 3 cm (0.03 m) and a current of 10 A. The point P is at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the center of the primary coil. Therefore, we can calculate the magnetic field strength at point P due to the primary coil:\n\nB_primary = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A * (0.03 m)²) / (2 * ((0.03 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to consider the secondary coil with 100 loops and a radius of 5 cm (0.05 m). However, since the problem statement does not provide any information about the current in the secondary coil, we cannot calculate the magnetic field strength due to the secondary coil. \n\nAssuming that the magnetic field due to the secondary coil is negligible or not required for this problem, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the current-carrying transformer is given by the magnetic field strength due to the primary coil:\n\nB = B_primary\n\nCalculating B_primary:\n\nB_primary = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A * (0.03 m)²) / (2 * ((0.03 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\nB_primary ≈ 1.44 × 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the current-carrying transformer is approximately 1.44 × 10^(-5) T."
