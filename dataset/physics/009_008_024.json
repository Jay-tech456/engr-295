    "message_2": "When a ray of light travels from air to water, it undergoes refraction due to the change in the speed of light in different media. To determine the path of the light ray, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for air and water, respectively, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nThe index of refraction for air is approximately 1, and for water, it is approximately 1.33. Given an incidence angle (θ1) of 30 degrees, we can calculate the angle of refraction (θ2) using Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\n0.5 = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.33\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.5 / 1.33) ≈ 22.09°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 22.09 degrees.\n\nTo draw a ray diagram:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the boundary between air and water.\n2. Draw a line at a 30-degree angle to the normal (perpendicular to the boundary) to represent the incident ray.\n3. At the point where the incident ray meets the boundary, draw a line at a 22.09-degree angle to the normal to represent the refracted ray.\n\nThe ray diagram will show the incident ray entering the water at a 30-degree angle and then bending towards the normal as it continues to travel through the water at a 22.09-degree angle."
