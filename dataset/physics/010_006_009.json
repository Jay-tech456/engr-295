    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of buoyancy. The buoyant force acting on the cube is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the submerged part of the cube. The weight of the cube is equal to the mass of the cube multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²).\n\nLet's first find the volume and mass of the cube:\n\nSide length of the cube = 10 cm = 0.1 m (converted to meters)\nVolume of the cube (V_cube) = side length³ = (0.1 m)³ = 0.001 m³\nMass of the cube (m_cube) = density of wood × volume of the cube = 600 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ = 0.6 kg\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the cube:\n\nWeight of the cube (W_cube) = mass of the cube × acceleration due to gravity = 0.6 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 5.886 N\n\nLet x be the depth of the cube below the surface of the liquid. The volume of the liquid displaced by the submerged part of the cube is x × side length²:\n\nV_displaced = x × (0.1 m)²\n\nThe mass of the displaced liquid (m_displaced) is equal to the density of the liquid multiplied by the volume of the displaced liquid:\n\nm_displaced = 800 kg/m³ × x × (0.1 m)²\n\nThe weight of the displaced liquid (W_displaced) is equal to the mass of the displaced liquid multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity:\n\nW_displaced = 800 kg/m³ × x × (0.1 m)² × 9.81 m/s²\n\nAccording to the principle of buoyancy, the weight of the cube is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid:\n\nW_cube = W_displaced\n5.886 N = 800 kg/m³ × x × (0.1 m)² × 9.81 m/s²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 5.886 N / (800 kg/m³ × (0.1 m)² × 9.81 m/s²) = 0.075 m\n\nSo, the depth of the cube below the surface of the liquid is 0.075 m or 7.5 cm."
