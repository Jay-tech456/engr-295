    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop, we can break the loop into four segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment, then sum them up. Let's consider one segment of the square loop, with current flowing in the positive x-direction. The position vector r for a point on the axis and 15 cm away from the center of the loop will have coordinates (x, y, z) = (x, 5, 15), where x varies from -5 cm to 5 cm.\n\nThe differential length vector dl for this segment will be (dx, 0, 0), and the cross product dl x r will be (0, -15dx, 5dx). The magnitude of the position vector r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x² + 5² + 15²) = sqrt(x² + 250)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law formula:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (0, -15dx, 5dx)) / (x² + 250)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field due to this segment, we need to integrate dB over the length of the segment from x = -5 cm to x = 5 cm:\n\nB₁ = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (0, -15dx, 5dx)) / (x² + 250)^(3/2) from x = -5 to x = 5\n\nSince the square loop is symmetrical, the magnetic field due to the other three segments will have the same magnitude but different directions. We can find the total magnetic field by summing the magnetic fields due to all four segments:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄\n\nHowever, due to symmetry, the magnetic fields due to the segments in the x-direction will cancel each other out, leaving only the magnetic fields due to the segments in the z-direction:\n\nB_total = 2 * Bz\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral for Bz:\n\nBz = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * 5dx) / (x² + 250)^(3/2) from x = -5 to x = 5\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods (such as a computer program or calculator) to evaluate it. Using a numerical integration tool, we find:\n\nBz ≈ 1.32 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nNow we can find the total magnetic field:\n\nB_total = 2 * Bz ≈ 2 * 1.32 × 10⁻⁶ T ≈ 2.64 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the loop and 15 cm away from the center of the loop is approximately 2.64 × 10⁻⁶ T."
