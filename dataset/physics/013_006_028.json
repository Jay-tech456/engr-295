    "message_2": "A supernova is a powerful explosion that occurs at the end of a massive star's life cycle. The energy released during a supernova explosion is immense, with estimates ranging from 10^44 to 10^46 Joules (1 to 100 foe, where 1 foe = 10^44 J). This energy is released in the form of light, neutrinos, and kinetic energy of the ejected material.\n\nThe energy released during a supernova explosion can be estimated using the following equation:\n\nE = M * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). For a typical supernova, the mass of the ejected material is about 1.4 solar masses (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg). Therefore, the energy released can be calculated as:\n\nE = 1.4 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE â‰ˆ 2.5 x 10^46 Joules\n\nThis energy release has a significant impact on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The explosion generates a shock wave that propagates through the ISM, compressing and heating the gas and dust. This process can create a shell-like structure called a supernova remnant, which can be observed for thousands of years after the explosion.\n\nThe energy from the supernova can also trigger the formation of new stars by compressing the surrounding gas and dust, causing it to collapse under its own gravity. Additionally, the explosion disperses heavy elements synthesized during the star's life and the explosion itself, enriching the ISM with elements necessary for the formation of planets and life.\n\nIn summary, a supernova explosion releases an immense amount of energy, estimated to be around 10^44 to 10^46 Joules. This energy affects the surrounding interstellar medium by generating shock waves that compress and heat the gas and dust, forming supernova remnants and triggering new star formation, as well as dispersing heavy elements necessary for planet and life formation."
