    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizing filter, the intensity of the resulting polarized light is reduced by a factor of the percentage of light allowed to pass through. In this case, the polarizing filter allows 50% of the light to pass through.\n\nTo find the intensity of the resulting polarized light, multiply the initial intensity by the percentage of light allowed to pass through:\n\nIntensity of polarized light = Initial intensity × Percentage of light allowed to pass through\n\nIntensity of polarized light = 10 W/m² × 0.50\n\nIntensity of polarized light = 5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the resulting polarized light is 5 W/m²."
