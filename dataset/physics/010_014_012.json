    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft traveling at Mach 2 encounters a shock wave. If the aircraft's velocity before encountering the shock wave is 686 meters per second and the density of air before the shock wave is 1.225 kg/m³, what is the density behind the shock wave? Assume the process is isentropic.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the isentropic flow relations for a normal shock wave. The normal shock wave relations are derived from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the shock wave. The isentropic flow relations are applicable for an ideal gas with constant specific heats.\n\nFor an isentropic process, we can use the following relation:\n\nρ2/ρ1 = [(γ + 1) * M1^2] / [(γ - 1) * M1^2 + 2]\n\nWhere:\nρ1 = density before the shock wave (1.225 kg/m³)\nρ2 = density after the shock wave\nM1 = Mach number before the shock wave (2)\nγ = ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for ρ2:\n\nρ2/1.225 = [(1.4 + 1) * 2^2] / [(1.4 - 1) * 2^2 + 2]\nρ2/1.225 = [2.4 * 4] / [0.4 * 4 + 2]\nρ2/1.225 = 9.6 / 3.6\nρ2 = 1.225 * (9.6 / 3.6)\nρ2 ≈ 3.306 kg/m³\n\nSo, the density of air behind the shock wave is approximately 3.306 kg/m³."
