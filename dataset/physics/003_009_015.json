    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being measured.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a sphere carrying a current, we need to consider the total magnetic field due to all the current elements on the sphere. To do this, we will integrate the Biot-Savart Law over the surface of the sphere.\n\nLet's first consider the magnetic field due to a small current element on the sphere. The magnetic field dB at a point P located 0.2 m away from the center of the sphere due to this small current element can be given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dA x r) / (4π * r^3)\n\nwhere dA is the infinitesimal area of the current element.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is symmetric, the magnetic field at point P due to all the current elements will have the same direction. Therefore, we can integrate the magnitudes of the magnetic fields and then find the total magnetic field.\n\nLet's denote the angle between the position vector r and the normal to the infinitesimal area dA as θ. Then, we can write the magnitude of the cross product dA x r as:\n\n|dA x r| = dA * r * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can write the magnitude of the magnetic field dB as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dA * r * sin(θ)) / (4π * r^3)\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field at a point located 0.2 m away from the center of the sphere, we have r = 0.2 m. Now, we can integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫ (μ₀ * I * dA * sin(θ)) / (4π * r^2)\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 0.1 m, so its surface area is given by:\n\nA = 4π * (0.1)^2 = 4π * 0.01 m²\n\nNow, we can perform the integration:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * A * sin(θ)) / (4π * r^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π * 10^-7 Tm/A * 5 A * 4π * 0.01 m² * sin(θ)) / (4π * (0.2 m)^2)\n\nB = (20π * 10^-7 T * sin(θ)) / (0.04π)\n\nB = 5 * 10^-5 T * sin(θ)\n\nHowever, we still need to find the value of sin(θ). Since the magnetic field at point P is due to the entire sphere, the angle θ will vary depending on the position of the current element on the sphere. In this case, we cannot find a specific value for sin(θ) without more information about the distribution of the current on the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point located 0.2 m away from the center of the sphere can be given by:\n\nB = 5 * 10^-5 T * sin(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the position vector r and the normal to the infinitesimal area dA, and its value depends on the distribution of the current on the sphere."
