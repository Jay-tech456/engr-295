    "message_2": "A star with a mass similar to our Sun takes approximately 10 billion years to evolve from its birth as a protostar to its death as a white dwarf. The evolution of a star can be divided into several stages, including the main sequence, red giant phase, and white dwarf phase.\n\nDuring the main sequence phase, which lasts about 90% of a star's lifetime, the star fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through nuclear reactions. This process is called nucleosynthesis. In a star like the Sun, this phase lasts for about 9 billion years.\n\nAs the hydrogen in the core gets depleted, the star enters the red giant phase. During this phase, the core contracts and heats up, while the outer layers expand. The star begins to fuse helium into heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen in its core. This phase lasts for about 1 billion years.\n\nAfter the red giant phase, the star sheds its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The remaining core becomes a white dwarf, which is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen. The white dwarf will eventually cool down and become a black dwarf, but this process takes longer than the current age of the universe.\n\nThroughout the star's life, nucleosynthesis creates elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The fusion of hydrogen into helium in the main sequence phase produces small amounts of heavier elements like lithium, beryllium, and boron. In the red giant phase, the fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen contributes to the creation of heavier elements. However, elements heavier than iron are primarily formed in the supernova explosions of massive stars, not in stars like our Sun."
