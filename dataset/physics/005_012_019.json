    "message_2": "To determine the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. In this case, v = 0.9c.\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.9c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / √(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\nK = (2.294 - 1)(2.4 kg)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s)²\nK ≈ 1.294 x 2.4 kg x (9 x 10^16 m²/s²)\nK ≈ 3.1104 x 10^17 J\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 3.1104 x 10^17 Joules."
