Another spaceship travels in the opposite direction at a velocity of 0.6c relative to Earth. What is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship according to relativistic velocity addition?",
    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity of the second spaceship with respect to the first spaceship, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.8c and v2 = -0.6c (negative because it's in the opposite direction).\n\nv_rel = (0.8c - 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * -0.6c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / (1 - 0.48)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / 0.52\n\nv_rel â‰ˆ 0.3846c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship is approximately 0.3846c."
