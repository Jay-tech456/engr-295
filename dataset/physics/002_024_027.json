    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the vapor pressure of water at a certain temperature using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The given values are the enthalpy of vaporization of water (40.7 kJ/mol), the gas constant (8.314 J/mol•K), the boiling point of water (100 °C), and the melting point of water (0 °C). What is the vapor pressure of water at a temperature of 25 °C?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we first need to convert the given temperatures to Kelvin. \n\nBoiling point of water = 100 °C = 373.15 K\nMelting point of water = 0 °C = 273.15 K\nTemperature at which we need to find the vapor pressure = 25 °C = 298.15 K\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the gas constant.\n\nWe know the boiling point of water, so we can use that as T1 and the vapor pressure at boiling point (P1) is 1 atm or 101325 Pa. We need to find the vapor pressure (P2) at 25 °C (298.15 K), which is T2.\n\nln(P2/101325) = -((40.7 * 10^3 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol•K)) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nNow, we can solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101325) ≈ -9.840\n\nTaking the exponent of both sides:\n\nP2/101325 ≈ 5.25 * 10^(-5)\n\nP2 ≈ 5.25 * 10^(-5) * 101325\n\nP2 ≈ 5320 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C is approximately 5320 Pa."
