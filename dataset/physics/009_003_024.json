    "message_1": "A light ray travels from a medium with a refractive index of 1.33 towards a medium with a refractive index of 1.50. The incident angle is 40 degrees. Determine the critical angle for total internal reflection to occur at the interface between the two media.",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical angle for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees. In this case, we want to find the critical angle (θ1) at which this occurs.\n\nRearranging Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nSince θ2 is 90 degrees for total internal reflection:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 / n1\n\nPlugging in the given refractive indices:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.50 / 1.33\n\nsin(θ1) ≈ 1.127\n\nHowever, the sine function cannot be greater than 1, which means total internal reflection cannot occur in this case. The light will always be refracted when passing from a medium with a refractive index of 1.33 to a medium with a refractive index of 1.50."
