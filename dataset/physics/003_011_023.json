    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters above the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a circular disc of radius R carrying a current I, we can consider an infinitesimal current loop of radius r and thickness dr at a distance r from the center of the disc. The magnetic field dB due to this current loop at a point P located h meters above the center of the disc can be calculated as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2πr * I * dr * h) / (r² + h²)^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = R) will give us the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * h) / 4π * ∫(r * dr) / (r² + h²)^(3/2) from r = 0 to r = R\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let's set:\n\nu = r² + h²\ndu = 2r dr\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * h) / 8π * ∫(du) / u^(3/2)\n\nThe limits of integration will change as well. When r = 0:\n\nu = 0² + h² = h²\n\nWhen r = R:\n\nu = R² + h²\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * h) / 8π * ∫(du) / u^(3/2) from u = h² to u = R² + h²\n\nThis integral can be solved as:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * h) / 8π * [-2 * u^(-1/2)] from u = h² to u = R² + h²\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nR = 0.2 m\nh = 0.1 m\nI = 5.0 A\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 5.0 * 0.1) / 8π * [-2 * ((0.2² + 0.1²)^(-1/2) - (0.1²)^(-1/2))]\n\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-6) * 5.0 * 0.1) * (-2 * (0.2236 - 0.4472))\n\nB ≈ 10^(-6) * (-2 * (-0.2236))\n\nB ≈ 4.472 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters above the center of the disc is approximately 4.472 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
