    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the circular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the loop, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nI = 3 A\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (30π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 9.42 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, which is at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the loop, is approximately 9.42 × 10^(-7) T (Tesla)."
