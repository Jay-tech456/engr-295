    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and water in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence (30 degrees), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven the refractive index of air (n1) is 1.00 and the refractive index of water (n2) is 1.33, we can plug these values into the equation along with the incident angle of 30 degrees:\n\n1.00 * sin(30) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.33\n\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.3759\n\nTo find the angle, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.3759:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3759)\n\nθ2 ≈ 22.09 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction when a light ray enters from air to water with an incident angle of 30 degrees is approximately 22.09 degrees."
