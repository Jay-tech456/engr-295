    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm_0 = 40,000 kg\nv = 0.8c\n\nFirst, we need to find the factor (1 - v^2/c^2):\n\n1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64c^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = 40,000 kg / sqrt(0.36) = 40,000 kg / 0.6 â‰ˆ 66,666.67 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 66,666.67 kg."
