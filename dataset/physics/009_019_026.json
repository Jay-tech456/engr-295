    "message_2": "In Young's double-slit experiment, the condition for bright fringes is given by:\n\nm * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere m is the order of the fringe (m = 1, 2, 3, ...), λ is the wavelength of the light source, d is the spacing between the slits, and θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe.\n\nWe are given that the third bright fringe (m = 3) is observed to be 4.5 cm from the central maximum on a screen located 1.5 m from the slits. We can use the small-angle approximation to relate the angle θ to the distance y from the central maximum:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) = y / L\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slits and the screen. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nsin(θ) = (4.5 cm) / (1.5 m) = 0.045 / 1.5 = 0.03\n\nNow, we can use the condition for bright fringes to find the spacing between the slits:\n\n3 * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nRearranging for d, we get:\n\nd = (3 * λ) / sin(θ)\n\nPlugging in the given wavelength (λ = 600 nm = 6 * 10^(-7) m) and the calculated sin(θ), we get:\n\nd = (3 * 6 * 10^(-7) m) / 0.03 = 18 * 10^(-7) m / 0.03 = 6 * 10^(-7) m / 0.01\n\nd = 6 * 10^(-4) m\n\nSo, the spacing between the two slits in Young's double-slit experiment is 6 * 10^(-4) m, or 0.6 mm."
