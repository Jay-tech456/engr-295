    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, the focal length is:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe object distance (u) is given as 15 cm. Since the object is in front of the mirror, we will take u as negative:\n\nu = -15 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values of f and u into the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n-3/30 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can invert both sides to find v:\n\nv = -30/3\nv = -10 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image. The image distance (v) is 10 cm.\n\nNext, we will find the size and nature of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values of v and u:\n\nm = -(-10)/(-15)\nm = 10/15\nm = 2/3\n\nThe magnification is 2/3, which means the image is smaller than the object (since m < 1). The positive sign indicates that the image is upright.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is virtual, upright, and smaller than the object. The image is located 10 cm in front of the mirror, and its size is 2/3 of the object's size."
