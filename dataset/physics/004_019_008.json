    "message_1": "A spaceship is orbiting a planet with a gravity field that causes time dilation. If the planet's gravity is strong enough to slow down time by a factor of 2 compared to Earth's time, and the spaceship spent 1 hour in orbit around the planet, how much time would have passed on the spaceship when it returns to Earth?",
    "message_2": "If the planet's gravity slows down time by a factor of 2 compared to Earth's time, this means that for every 2 hours that pass on Earth, only 1 hour passes on the spaceship.\n\nSince the spaceship spent 1 hour in orbit around the planet, we can use the time dilation factor to determine how much time would have passed on Earth during this period:\n\n1 hour on spaceship * 2 (time dilation factor) = 2 hours on Earth\n\nSo, when the spaceship returns to Earth, 2 hours would have passed on Earth."
