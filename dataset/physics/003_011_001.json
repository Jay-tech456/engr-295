    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x is the cross product.\n\nSince the current is along the circumference of the disc, we can consider a small arc element of length ds on the circumference, carrying a current I. The arc element ds is related to the angle dθ by ds = R * dθ.\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field dB at a point P on the axis of the disc, at a distance x from the center of the disc, due to the small arc element ds.\n\nThe position vector r from the arc element ds to point P has a magnitude r = √(R² + x²) and makes an angle θ with the x-axis. The magnetic field dB is perpendicular to the plane formed by r and ds, and its magnitude can be written as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * ds * sin(θ)) / r³\n\nSubstituting ds = R * dθ, we get:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * R * dθ * sin(θ)) / (√(R² + x²))³\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire circumference of the disc to find the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = ∫ dB = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * ∫ (sin(θ) * dθ) / (R² + x²)^(3/2) from 0 to 2π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nu = R² + x²\ndu = 2R * dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 8πx) * ∫ (du / u^(3/2)) from R² to (R² + x²)\n\nNow, integrating with respect to u, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 8πx) * [-2 / √u] from R² to (R² + x²)\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 8πx) * (-2 / √(R² + x²) + 2 / R)\n\nFinally, simplifying the expression, we get the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, at a distance x from the center of the disc:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (4π * x * (R² + x²)^(3/2))"
