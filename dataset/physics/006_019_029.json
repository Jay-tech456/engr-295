    "message_2": "To determine the energy difference between the K and L shells of a copper atom, we can use the X-ray absorption and emission spectra data. Specifically, we can look at the Kα and Lα lines, which represent the transitions of electrons from the L shell to the K shell and vice versa.\n\nThe energy of the Kα line is approximately 8.05 keV, and the energy of the Lα line is approximately 0.93 keV. The energy difference between the K and L shells can be calculated as the difference between these two values:\n\nEnergy difference = E(Kα) - E(Lα)\nEnergy difference = 8.05 keV - 0.93 keV\nEnergy difference ≈ 7.12 keV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the K and L shells of a copper atom is approximately 7.12 keV based on the X-ray absorption and emission spectra data."
