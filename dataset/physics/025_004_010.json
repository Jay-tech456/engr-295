    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (∆G) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we need to know the reaction quotient (Q) and the concentration of reactants and products. The relationship between ∆G, ∆G°, and Q is given by the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆G° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\n∆G = change in free energy\n∆G° = standard free energy (-18.5 kJ/mol in this case)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (298 K in this case)\nln(Q) = natural logarithm of the reaction quotient\n\nHowever, without the information about the reaction quotient (Q) and the concentration of reactants and products, we cannot calculate the exact value of ∆G for this enzyme-catalyzed reaction."
