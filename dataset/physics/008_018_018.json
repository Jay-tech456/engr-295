    "message_2": "To determine the value of the strong coupling constant (αs) at a center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, we need the experimental measurements of hadronic cross-sections at the Z$^0$ peak. However, you have not provided any specific measurements or data.\n\nIn general, the strong coupling constant can be extracted from the hadronic cross-section measurements using the following relation:\n\nσ_had = σ_0 * (1 + αs/π + ...)\n\nwhere σ_had is the hadronic cross-section, σ_0 is the lowest-order cross-section, and the terms in the parentheses represent the perturbative QCD corrections, with αs being the strong coupling constant.\n\nOnce you provide the experimental measurements of hadronic cross-sections, we can proceed to calculate the value of αs at a center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV."
