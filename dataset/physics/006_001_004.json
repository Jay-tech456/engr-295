    "message_2": "To calculate the energy needed to excite an electron from the n=1 energy level to the n=3 energy level in a hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level (n=3), and ni is the initial energy level (n=1).\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/3^2 - 1/1^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/9 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-8/9)\nΔE = 12.1 eV\n\nSo, the energy needed to excite the electron from n=1 to n=3 is 12.1 eV.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation that would be emitted when the electron transitions back from the n=3 level to the n=1 level. We can use the following equations:\n\nE = h * f\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules:\n\nE = 12.1 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nE = 1.936 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf = E / h\nf = (1.936 x 10^-18 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nf = 2.922 x 10^15 Hz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = c / f\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.922 x 10^15 Hz)\nλ = 1.027 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted during the transition from n=3 to n=1 is 2.922 x 10^15 Hz, and the wavelength is 1.027 x 10^-7 m (or 102.7 nm)."
