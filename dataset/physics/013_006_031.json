    "message_2": "A core-collapse supernova is a type of supernova that occurs when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity. The core-collapse supernova explosion releases an enormous amount of energy, primarily in the form of neutrinos. The amount of energy released during a core-collapse supernova explosion depends on the mass of the progenitor star and the details of the explosion mechanism.\n\nThe energy released during a core-collapse supernova can be estimated using the Bethe formula, which is derived from the binding energy of a nucleus:\n\nE = (3/5) * (G * M^2) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the progenitor star, and R is the radius of the star.\n\nThe mass of the progenitor star plays a crucial role in determining the energy released during a core-collapse supernova. Stars with masses between 8 and 20 solar masses (M☉) are expected to undergo core-collapse supernovae. The energy released during the explosion depends on the mass of the iron core that forms during the final stages of the star's life, as well as the mass of the outer layers that are ejected during the explosion.\n\nFor a typical core-collapse supernova, the energy released is on the order of 10^44 joules (J), or about 10^51 ergs. About 99% of this energy is carried away by neutrinos, while the remaining 1% is in the form of kinetic energy of the ejected material and electromagnetic radiation.\n\nTo estimate the variation in energy release depending on the mass of the progenitor star, we can use the following empirical relation:\n\nE(M) = E_0 * (M / M_0)^α\n\nwhere E(M) is the energy released for a star of mass M, E_0 is the energy released for a star of mass M_0 (a reference mass, typically 15 M☉), and α is a parameter that describes the dependence of the energy on the mass of the progenitor star. Observations and theoretical models suggest that α is between 1 and 2.\n\nUsing this relation, we can estimate the energy released for different progenitor star masses. For example, for a star with a mass of 10 M☉:\n\nE(10) = E_0 * (10 / 15)^α\n\nAssuming α = 1.5, we get:\n\nE(10) ≈ 0.42 * E_0\n\nThis means that a 10 M☉ star would release about 42% of the energy released by a 15 M☉ star during a core-collapse supernova explosion.\n\nIt is important to note that these calculations are based on simplified models and assumptions. The actual energy release during a core-collapse supernova explosion depends on many factors, including the detailed structure and composition of the progenitor star, the explosion mechanism, and the efficiency of neutrino energy deposition. Observations of supernovae and their remnants, as well as advanced numerical simulations, are essential for improving our understanding of these complex and energetic events."
