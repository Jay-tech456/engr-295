    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens near its edge are focused at a slightly different point than the rays passing through the center of the lens. This results in a blurred image.\n\nTo calculate the spherical aberration, we can use the formula:\n\nSA = (n - 1) * (R1 - R2) * h^4 / (64 * n * f^3)\n\nwhere SA is the spherical aberration, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces, h is the height of the marginal ray at the lens, and f is the focal length of the lens.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate the spherical aberration. We need the refractive index of the lens material (n) and the height of the marginal ray at the lens (h). Additionally, we only have one radius of curvature (R = 30 cm), while we need both R1 and R2 for the formula.\n\nIf we assume that the lens is made of crown glass, which has a refractive index of approximately 1.52, and that the lens is a thin lens with equal radii of curvature (R1 = R2 = 30 cm), we can proceed with the calculation. However, we still need the height of the marginal ray (h) to complete the calculation.\n\nIf you can provide the height of the marginal ray (h) and confirm the assumptions made, we can calculate the spherical aberration for the given lens."
