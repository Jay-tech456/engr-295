    "message_1": "A proton in a magnetic field with a strength of 3.5 T absorbs radiofrequency radiation at a frequency of 42.58 MHz. What is the magnetic resonance frequency of a carbon-13 nucleus in a magnetic field of 11.7 T?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ), which is the ratio of the magnetic moment to the angular momentum of a particle. The Larmor equation relates the gyromagnetic ratio to the resonance frequency (ν) and the magnetic field strength (B):\n\nν = γ * B / (2 * π)\n\nFor a proton, the gyromagnetic ratio is approximately γ_p = 2.675 * 10^8 T^-1 s^-1. We are given the magnetic field strength (B_p) and the resonance frequency (ν_p) for the proton:\n\nB_p = 3.5 T\nν_p = 42.58 MHz = 42.58 * 10^6 Hz\n\nWe can rearrange the Larmor equation to find the gyromagnetic ratio for the proton:\n\nγ_p = (2 * π * ν_p) / B_p\n\nNow, we need to find the gyromagnetic ratio for the carbon-13 nucleus (γ_C13). The ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios for carbon-13 and proton is approximately 1/4:\n\nγ_C13 = γ_p / 4\n\nWe are given the magnetic field strength for the carbon-13 nucleus (B_C13):\n\nB_C13 = 11.7 T\n\nNow, we can use the Larmor equation to find the resonance frequency for the carbon-13 nucleus (ν_C13):\n\nν_C13 = γ_C13 * B_C13 / (2 * π)\n\nLet's calculate the values step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the gyromagnetic ratio for the proton:\nγ_p = (2 * π * ν_p) / B_p = (2 * π * 42.58 * 10^6 Hz) / 3.5 T ≈ 76.16 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1\n\n2. Calculate the gyromagnetic ratio for the carbon-13 nucleus:\nγ_C13 = γ_p / 4 = (76.16 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1) / 4 ≈ 19.04 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1\n\n3. Calculate the resonance frequency for the carbon-13 nucleus:\nν_C13 = γ_C13 * B_C13 / (2 * π) = (19.04 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1) * 11.7 T / (2 * π) ≈ 35.14 * 10^6 Hz\n\nSo, the magnetic resonance frequency of a carbon-13 nucleus in a magnetic field of 11.7 T is approximately 35.14 MHz."
