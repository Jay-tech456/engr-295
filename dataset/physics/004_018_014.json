    "message_1": "What is the shift in wavelength (in nanometers) of a photon emitted from the surface of a planet with a gravitational field strength of 10 m/s² compared to its wavelength when measured on a distant planet with no gravitational field interference? (Assume the photon originates from a spectral line with a rest wavelength of 500 nm)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shift in wavelength due to the gravitational field, we can use the gravitational redshift formula derived from General Relativity:\n\nΔλ/λ = GM/c²R\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the planet, c is the speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s), and R is the radius of the planet.\n\nHowever, we are given the gravitational field strength (g) instead of the mass (M) and radius (R) of the planet. We can relate g to M and R using the formula:\n\ng = GM/R²\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for M, we get:\n\nM = gR²/G\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for M back into the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = gR²/(c²R)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nΔλ/λ = gR/c²\n\nWe still need the radius (R) of the planet to calculate the shift in wavelength. Without this information, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the shift in wavelength. However, if you provide the radius of the planet, we can calculate the shift in wavelength using the formula above."
