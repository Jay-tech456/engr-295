Specifically, how can we apply the tools of conformal field theory and perturbation theory to compute these amplitudes for various processes, such as scattering of massless particles or interactions with D-branes?",
    "message_2": "Calculating and studying the scattering amplitudes of closed string theory in quantum field theory requires a combination of techniques from conformal field theory (CFT) and perturbation theory. Here's an outline of the process:\n\n1. Worldsheet description: In string theory, particles are described as one-dimensional objects called strings. The scattering of strings can be represented by a two-dimensional surface called the worldsheet. For closed strings, the worldsheet has no boundaries and can be represented by a Riemann surface.\n\n2. Conformal field theory: CFT is a powerful tool for studying two-dimensional quantum field theories with conformal symmetry. In the context of string theory, CFT is used to describe the dynamics of strings on the worldsheet. The basic objects in CFT are vertex operators, which represent the insertion of string states into the worldsheet.\n\n3. Perturbation theory: In order to compute scattering amplitudes, we need to consider the interactions between strings. This is done using perturbation theory, where the interactions are treated as small perturbations to the free string theory. The perturbative expansion is organized in terms of the string coupling constant, which determines the strength of the interactions.\n\n4. Scattering amplitudes: The scattering amplitudes for various processes can be computed by considering the correlation functions of vertex operators on the worldsheet. These correlation functions can be calculated using the techniques of CFT, such as operator product expansions and conformal transformations.\n\n5. Massless particles: In the low-energy limit, string theory reduces to a quantum field theory of massless particles, such as gravitons, gauge bosons, and other fields. The scattering amplitudes for these massless particles can be extracted from the string amplitudes by taking the appropriate limits.\n\n6. Interactions with D-branes: D-branes are extended objects in string theory that can interact with closed strings. To study the interactions between closed strings and D-branes, one needs to consider the open-closed string duality. This involves extending the CFT techniques to include boundary conditions on the worldsheet, which correspond to the presence of D-branes.\n\nIn summary, the calculation of scattering amplitudes in closed string theory involves a combination of worldsheet descriptions, conformal field theory techniques, and perturbation theory. These tools allow us to compute the amplitudes for various processes, such as scattering of massless particles or interactions with D-branes."
