    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0ħ²) / (mee²)\n\nwhere:\n- ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²)\n- ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.055 x 10^(-34) Js)\n- me is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n\nGiven that the charge on the nucleus is +1, the formula remains the same. The mass of the nucleus is approximately 1836 times that of the electron, but this does not affect the Bohr radius calculation, as it only depends on the mass of the electron.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\na0 = (4π(8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²)(1.055 x 10^(-34) Js)²) / ((9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)(1.602 x 10^(-19) C)²)\na0 ≈ 5.291 x 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius in a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291 x 10^(-11) meters."
