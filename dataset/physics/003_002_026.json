    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field B at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/meter), and I is the current passing through the solenoid (in amperes).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the solenoid has 200 turns and a length of 50 cm (0.5 meters), we can calculate n as follows:\n\nn = turns / length\nn = 200 / 0.5\nn = 400 turns/meter\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 400 turns/m * 5 A\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 2000 turns*m⁻¹*A\nB ≈ (12.57 × 10⁻⁷ T) * 2000\nB ≈ 25.14 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field B at the center of the solenoid is approximately 2.514 × 10⁻³ T or 2.514 mT (millitesla)."
