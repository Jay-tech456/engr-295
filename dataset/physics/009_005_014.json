    "message_1": "A student is standing 2 meters in front of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 4 meters. The student's height is 1.5 meters. Calculate the image distance, magnification, and the height of the image.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance (2 meters), and di is the image distance. The focal length (f) can be found using the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 4m/2 = 2m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n\n1/2 = 1/2 + 1/di\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for di, we get:\n\n1/di = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0\n\nSince 1/di = 0, this means that di is infinite, which indicates that the image is formed at infinity.\n\nNext, we can calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nSince di is infinite, the magnification is 0.\n\nFinally, to find the height of the image (hi), we can use the formula:\n\nhi = M * ho\n\nwhere ho is the object height (1.5 meters). Since the magnification is 0, the height of the image is also 0.\n\nIn summary, the image distance is at infinity, the magnification is 0, and the height of the image is 0. This result indicates that the student is standing at the focal point of the concave mirror, and no clear image is formed."
