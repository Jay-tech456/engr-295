    "message_2": "To determine the nature, size, and position of the image formed, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance (distance of the candle from the lens), and v is the image distance (distance of the image from the lens).\n\nGiven, the focal length f = 10 cm and the object distance u = -15 cm (negative sign because the object is on the left side of the lens).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 30v to eliminate the fractions:\n\n3v = -2v + 30v^2\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n5v = 30v^2\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\nv = 6v^2\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv(1 - 6v) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: v = 0 or v = 1/6 cm. However, v = 0 doesn't make sense in this context, as it would mean the image is formed at the same point as the lens. So, we consider the other solution:\n\nv = 1/6 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can determine the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(1/6)/(-15)\n\nM = 1/90\n\nSince the magnification is less than 1, the image is diminished (smaller than the object). Also, the magnification is positive, which means the image is erect (upright).\n\nFinally, we can determine the nature of the image. Since the image distance is positive, the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens, which means it is a virtual image.\n\nIn summary, the image formed is a virtual, erect, and diminished image located at a distance of 1/6 cm from the lens on the opposite side of the object."
