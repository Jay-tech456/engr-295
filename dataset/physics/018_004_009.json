    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has a mass of about 125 GeV/c², and it can decay into various particles. The decay modes and their branching ratios depend on the mass of the Higgs boson and the masses of the particles it decays into.\n\nThe main decay modes of the Higgs boson are:\n\n1. Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks (b and b-bar):\n   Branching ratio: ~58%\n\n2. Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-):\n   Branching ratio: ~21%\n\n3. Higgs boson decays into a pair of tau leptons (tau+ and tau-):\n   Branching ratio: ~6.3%\n\n4. Higgs boson decays into a pair of charm quarks (c and c-bar):\n   Branching ratio: ~2.9%\n\n5. Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons (Z and Z):\n   Branching ratio: ~2.6%\n\n6. Higgs boson decays into a pair of gluons (g and g) through a loop of top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~8.6%\n\n7. Higgs boson decays into a pair of photons (γ and γ) through a loop of W bosons or top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~0.23%\n\n8. Higgs boson decays into a Z boson and a photon (Z and γ) through a loop of W bosons or top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~0.015%\n\nThese branching ratios are approximate values and can vary slightly depending on the specific Higgs boson mass and the experimental uncertainties. The Higgs boson can also decay into other particles, but these decay modes have much smaller branching ratios and are challenging to observe experimentally."
