    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the state of the qubit after the measurement in the +x direction. The eigenstates of the spin in the +x direction are given by:\n\n$|+\\rangle_x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$\n$|-\\rangle_x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$\n\nSince the measurement in the +x direction gave the result $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the qubit is now in the state $|-\\rangle_x$. Now, we want to find the probability of measuring the spin of the qubit in the +z direction. The eigenstates of the spin in the +z direction are $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. \n\nWe can express the state $|-\\rangle_x$ in terms of the eigenstates of the spin in the +z direction:\n\n$|-\\rangle_x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$\n\nNow, we can find the probability of measuring the spin in the +z direction by calculating the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate:\n\n$P(+z) = |\\langle 0 | -\\rangle_x|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\langle 0 | (|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)\\right|^2$\n\n$P(+z) = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\langle 0 | 0\\rangle - \\langle 0 | 1\\rangle)\\right|^2$\n\nSince $\\langle 0 | 0\\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle 0 | 1\\rangle = 0$, we have:\n\n$P(+z) = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1 - 0)\\right|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the spin of the qubit in the +z direction is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
