    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the ideal gas law and the first law of thermodynamics. The ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nSince the volume remains constant, the work done by the system is zero (W = 0). Therefore, the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added to the system:\n\nΔU = Q\n\nNow, let's find the initial and final temperatures of the gas.\n\nInitial state:\nP1 = 2 atm\nV1 = 1 m³\n\nFinal state:\nP2 = 4 atm\nV2 = 1 m³\n\nWe need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa. 1 atm = 101325 Pa.\n\nP1 = 2 * 101325 Pa = 202650 Pa\nP2 = 4 * 101325 Pa = 405300 Pa\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, we can find the initial and final temperatures:\n\nT1 = P1V1 / nR\nT2 = P2V2 / nR\n\nSince the number of moles (n) and the gas constant (R) are the same in both cases, we can write:\n\nT1 / T2 = P1V1 / P2V2\n\nT1 / T2 = (202650 * 1) / (405300 * 1)\n\nT1 / T2 = 0.5\n\nT2 = 2 * T1\n\nNow, we know that the internal energy (U) of an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature:\n\nU ∝ T\n\nSo, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is proportional to the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔU ∝ ΔT\n\nWe are given the initial internal energy (U1) as 3000 J. We can find the final internal energy (U2) using the proportionality between the temperatures:\n\nU2 / U1 = T2 / T1\n\nU2 = U1 * (T2 / T1)\n\nU2 = 3000 * 2\n\nU2 = 6000 J\n\nNow, we can find the change in internal energy (ΔU):\n\nΔU = U2 - U1\n\nΔU = 6000 - 3000\n\nΔU = 3000 J\n\nSo, the change in internal energy of the gas when the pressure is increased to 4 atm while the volume remains constant is 3000 J."
