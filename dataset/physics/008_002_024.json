    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter particles:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the stars in their orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant galaxy passes through a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the light is bent due to the object's gravitational field. This bending of light, called gravitational lensing, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the object. Observations show that the mass distribution extends beyond the visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to determine the composition of the universe. These measurements indicate that a significant portion of the universe's mass is made up of non-baryonic (not made of protons and neutrons) dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies in the universe is not random but forms a cosmic web of filaments and voids. Simulations of the universe's evolution show that dark matter is necessary for the formation of this large-scale structure.\n\nScientists are searching for dark matter particles using several methods:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles as they pass through detectors on Earth. Examples of direct detection experiments include the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), the XENON experiment, and the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. These experiments use sensitive detectors to look for the tiny energy deposits or recoils of atomic nuclei when dark matter particles interact with them.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay. For example, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) search for gamma rays produced by dark matter interactions in space.\n\n3. Collider experiments: Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially create dark matter particles by smashing protons together at high energies. Scientists analyze the resulting particle collisions for signs of dark matter production.\n\n4. Theoretical and computational research: Scientists are also developing new theoretical models and conducting computer simulations to better understand the nature of dark matter and its interactions with other particles.\n\nDespite extensive searches, dark matter particles have not been directly detected yet. However, the ongoing experiments and research continue to refine our understanding of dark matter and its role in the universe."
