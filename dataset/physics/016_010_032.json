    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the maximum acceptable power loss in watts. Then, we can use this value to calculate the critical current density required for the superconductor.\n\n1. Calculate the maximum acceptable power loss:\n\nPower transmitted (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I)\nPower loss (P_loss) = 2% of Power transmitted (P)\n\nLet's assume the current (I) to be I_c (critical current). Then,\n\nP = 220 kV × I_c\nP_loss = 0.02 × P\n\n2. Calculate the resistance (R) of the superconductor:\n\nPower loss in a resistive conductor can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP_loss = I_c^2 × R\n\nFrom the above equation, we can find the resistance (R):\n\nR = P_loss / I_c^2\n\n3. Calculate the resistivity (ρ) of the superconductor:\n\nResistivity can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = ρ × (Length (L) / Cross-sectional area (A))\n\nWe need to find the cross-sectional area (A) of the superconductor, so let's rearrange the formula:\n\nA = ρ × (L / R)\n\n4. Calculate the critical current density (J_c):\n\nCritical current density can be calculated using the formula:\n\nJ_c = I_c / A\n\nNow, let's put everything together:\n\nP_loss = 0.02 × (220 kV × I_c)\nR = P_loss / I_c^2\nA = ρ × (100 km / R)\nJ_c = I_c / A\n\nSince we are not given the resistivity (ρ) of the superconductor, we cannot provide a numerical value for the critical current density (J_c). However, the above equations can be used to calculate J_c once the resistivity (ρ) is known."
