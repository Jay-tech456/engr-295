    "message_1": "What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes merging, if the masses of the black holes are 10 and 15 times the mass of the Sun and the distance between them is 2000 km?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes merging, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (8 * pi * G * (m1 + m2))\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nm1 = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nm2 = 15 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 2.984 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (8 * pi * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 2.984 x 10^31 kg))\n\nf ≈ (27 x 10^24 m^3/s^3) / (8 * pi * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (4.973 x 10^31 kg))\n\nf ≈ (27 x 10^24 m^3/s^3) / (1.048 x 10^22 m^3/s^2)\n\nf ≈ 2.57 x 10^2 Hz\n\nThe expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the two merging black holes is approximately 257 Hz. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency may vary depending on factors such as the black holes' spins and the specifics of their orbits."
