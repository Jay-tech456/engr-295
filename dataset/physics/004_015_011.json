    "message_2": "The most compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe comes from several independent observations, which together strongly suggest the presence of an unseen mass that influences the behavior of visible matter. Some of the key pieces of evidence are:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter surrounding the galaxies, providing the additional gravitational force needed to keep the outer stars and gas in orbit.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: According to general relativity, massive objects can bend light due to their gravitational influence. Observations of distant galaxies and galaxy clusters show that their light is bent and distorted in a way that can only be explained by the presence of a large amount of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which would have influenced the formation of cosmic structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Dark matter acts as a gravitational scaffold, allowing visible matter to clump together and form the large-scale structures we observe today.\n\n5. The Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, where the visible matter (mostly in the form of hot gas) has been separated from the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing). This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the majority of the mass in the system does not coincide with the visible matter.\n\nThese lines of evidence support the predictions of general relativity, as they all involve the behavior of matter and light in the presence of gravity. In particular, gravitational lensing is a direct consequence of general relativity, as it describes how light is bent by the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. The fact that the observed lensing effects require the presence of unseen mass to be explained is a strong indication that dark matter exists and interacts gravitationally with visible matter, as predicted by general relativity."
