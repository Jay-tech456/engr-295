    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and angle of incidence in the first medium (water), and n2 and θ2 are the refractive index and angle of refraction in the second medium (air).\n\nGiven:\nn1 = 1.33 (water)\nn2 = 1.00 (air)\nθ1 = 30 degrees\n\nWe need to find θ2.\n\nFirst, let's find the sine of the angle of incidence:\n\nsin(θ1) = sin(30) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Snell's Law equation:\n\n1.33 * 0.5 = 1.00 * sin(θ2)\n\n0.665 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, we need to take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.665)\n\nθ2 ≈ 41.8 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction when the light ray travels from water to air with an incident angle of 30 degrees is approximately 41.8 degrees."
