    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 800 lines per millimeter, and it is illuminated with monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm. What is the angle of the first order maximum?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of the first order maximum, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle of the maximum, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 800 lines per millimeter, we can find d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 800 lines/mm = 0.00125 mm/line\n\nNow, we need to convert d to meters:\n\nd = 0.00125 mm/line * (1 m / 1000 mm) = 1.25 * 10^-6 m/line\n\nWe are looking for the first order maximum, so m = 1. The wavelength of the light (λ) is given as 500 nm, which we need to convert to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5 * 10^-7 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the diffraction grating equation:\n\n(1.25 * 10^-6 m) * sin(θ) = (1) * (5 * 10^-7 m)\n\nsin(θ) = (5 * 10^-7 m) / (1.25 * 10^-6 m) = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.4:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.4) ≈ 23.58°\n\nSo, the angle of the first order maximum is approximately 23.58°."
