    "message_2": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the strong force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, which acts between quarks and gluons. Quarks are elementary particles that combine to form composite particles called hadrons, which include protons and neutrons. Gluons are the force carrier particles that mediate the strong force between quarks.\n\nThe strong force is responsible for binding quarks together to form hadrons (such as baryons and mesons) and also for binding protons and neutrons together to form atomic nuclei. The strong force is characterized by its strength and its confinement property, which means that it becomes stronger as quarks are pulled apart, effectively confining quarks within hadrons.\n\nIn the formation of hadrons, quarks are combined in specific ways according to the rules of QCD. Baryons, such as protons and neutrons, are formed by combining three quarks, while mesons are formed by combining a quark and an antiquark. The strong force between quarks is mediated by the exchange of gluons, which carry the color charge. Quarks carry one of three color charges (red, green, or blue), and antiquarks carry the corresponding anticolor charges. The strong force ensures that hadrons are always color-neutral, meaning the total color charge of a hadron is zero.\n\nThe decay of subatomic particles, such as hadrons and mesons, is also influenced by the strong force. The strong force is responsible for some of the decay processes that involve the transformation of quarks. For example, a meson can decay into other mesons or into a quark-antiquark pair through the strong force. However, it is important to note that not all decay processes are governed by the strong force. Some decays, such as beta decay, are governed by the weak force, another fundamental force of nature.\n\nIn summary, the strong force, as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), plays a crucial role in the formation and decay of subatomic particles such as hadrons and mesons. It is responsible for binding quarks together to form these particles and mediating their decay processes involving quark transformations."
