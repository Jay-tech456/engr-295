    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.8c relative to the Earth. Its rest length is 120 meters. What is its contracted length as observed by a stationary observer on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the contracted length of the spaceship as observed by a stationary observer on Earth, we can use the Lorentz contraction formula:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the rest length of the spaceship, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the rest length L0 = 120 meters and the relative velocity v = 0.8c, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = 120 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL = 120 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 120 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 120 * 0.6\n\nL = 72 meters\n\nSo, the contracted length of the spaceship as observed by a stationary observer on Earth is 72 meters."
