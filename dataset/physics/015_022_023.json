    "message_2": "The emission of gravitational waves leads to the loss of energy and angular momentum in a binary star system, causing the two stars to gradually move closer together and their orbital period to decrease over time. The rate of change in the orbital period due to gravitational wave emission can be calculated using the following formula derived from the General Theory of Relativity:\n\nΔP/P = -(96π/5) * (G^5/c^5) * (m1 * m2 * (m1 + m2)) / (a^4 * P)\n\nwhere:\nΔP is the change in the orbital period,\nP is the initial orbital period,\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nc is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s),\nm1 and m2 are the masses of the two stars in the binary system,\na is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the average distance between the two stars).\n\nThis formula assumes a circular orbit and that the masses of the stars remain constant over time. The rate of change in the orbital period will be negative, indicating that the period is decreasing as the stars move closer together due to the emission of gravitational waves."
