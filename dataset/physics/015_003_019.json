    "message_2": "The degree of polarization of gravitational waves is a measure of the extent to which the waves exhibit a specific, well-defined oscillation pattern. In general relativity, gravitational waves have two independent polarization states, often referred to as \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations. These two polarizations are analogous to the two polarization states of electromagnetic waves.\n\nDuring its first observation campaign in 2015, LIGO made the groundbreaking discovery of gravitational waves, specifically from the merger of two black holes. This event, known as GW150914, was detected on September 14, 2015. The analysis of the data from this event allowed LIGO to confirm the presence of both plus and cross polarizations in the detected gravitational waves.\n\nThe degree of polarization itself is not directly measured by LIGO, but the presence of both polarization states is consistent with the predictions of general relativity. This observation supports the idea that the source of the waves was indeed a binary black hole merger, as the specific pattern of the polarizations provides information about the dynamics of the merging system.\n\nThe detection of both polarizations also helps to rule out alternative theories of gravity that predict additional polarization states (e.g., scalar or vector polarizations). In this sense, the observation of gravitational waves by LIGO not only confirmed the existence of these waves but also provided further evidence supporting the validity of general relativity and our understanding of the source of the waves."
