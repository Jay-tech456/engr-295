    "message_1": "A spaceship moving at 0.8c relative to Earth emits a radio signal of 10 GHz. If the spaceship is moving directly towards Earth, what is the frequency of the radio signal received on Earth? (Assume negligible effects of the spaceship's motion on the Earth.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for the frequency shift:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the frequency observed on Earth,\nf_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship (10 GHz),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and\nc is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * 3\n\nf_observed = 30 GHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the radio signal received on Earth is 30 GHz."
