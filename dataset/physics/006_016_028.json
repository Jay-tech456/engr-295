    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect for a hydrogen atom, we need to find the Larmor frequency, which is the frequency at which the hydrogen nucleus precesses in the magnetic field. The Larmor frequency can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLarmor frequency (ν) = γ * B\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (42.576 MHz/T for hydrogen) and B is the magnetic field strength (2 T).\n\nν = 42.576 MHz/T * 2 T\n\nν = 85.152 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR effect for a hydrogen atom with a spin of ½ when placed in a magnetic field of 2 T is a Larmor frequency of 85.152 MHz."
