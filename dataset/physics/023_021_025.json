    "message_2": "To find the probability of measuring the spin of a qubit in the +z direction (|0⟩ state) after applying the Hadamard gate followed by a π/2 rotation around the y-axis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the Hadamard gate to the initial state |0⟩.\n2. Apply the π/2 rotation around the y-axis to the resulting state.\n3. Calculate the probability of measuring the state |0⟩.\n\nStep 1: Apply the Hadamard gate\nThe Hadamard gate is represented by the matrix:\nH = (1/√2) * | 1  1 |\n                   | 1 -1 |\n\nThe initial state |0⟩ is represented by the column vector:\n|0⟩ = | 1 |\n          | 0 |\n\nApplying the Hadamard gate to the initial state:\nH|0⟩ = (1/√2) * | 1  1 | * | 1 | = (1/√2) * | 1 |\n                                     | 1 -1 |   | 0 |            | 1 |\n\nSo, the resulting state after applying the Hadamard gate is:\n|ψ1⟩ = (1/√2) * | 1 |\n                          | 1 |\n\nStep 2: Apply the π/2 rotation around the y-axis\nThe π/2 rotation around the y-axis is represented by the matrix:\nRy(π/2) = | cos(π/4) -sin(π/4) |\n                 | sin(π/4)  cos(π/4) |\n\nApplying the π/2 rotation around the y-axis to the state |ψ1⟩:\nRy(π/2)|ψ1⟩ = | cos(π/4) -sin(π/4) | * (1/√2) * | 1 | = |  (cos(π/4) - sin(π/4))/√2  |\n                       | sin(π/4)  cos(π/4) |            | 1 |            |  (sin(π/4) + cos(π/4))/√2  |\n\nSo, the resulting state after applying the π/2 rotation around the y-axis is:\n|ψ2⟩ = |  (cos(π/4) - sin(π/4))/√2  |\n             |  (sin(π/4) + cos(π/4))/√2  |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of measuring the state |0⟩\nThe probability of measuring the state |0⟩ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the final state |ψ2⟩ and the state |0⟩:\n\nP(0) = |⟨0|ψ2⟩|^2 = |(1 0) * |  (cos(π/4) - sin(π/4))/√2  |^2\n                                    |  (sin(π/4) + cos(π/4))/√2  |\n\nP(0) = |(cos(π/4) - sin(π/4))/√2|^2\n\nP(0) = ((cos(π/4) - sin(π/4))^2) / 2\n\nNow, we know that cos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2. Substituting these values, we get:\n\nP(0) = ((1/√2 - 1/√2)^2) / 2 = (0^2) / 2 = 0\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the spin of the qubit in the +z direction after applying the Hadamard gate followed by a π/2 rotation around the y-axis is 0."
