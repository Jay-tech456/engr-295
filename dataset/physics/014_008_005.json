    "message_2": "The arrival direction of cosmic rays is influenced by several factors, including the location of their sources in the Milky Way galaxy, the magnetic fields within the galaxy, and the energy of the cosmic rays themselves. Cosmic rays are charged particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through space at nearly the speed of light. Their paths are bent by magnetic fields, which makes it challenging to trace their origins directly.\n\nHowever, the observed cosmic ray anisotropy, which refers to the uneven distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions, can provide some insight into the distribution of cosmic ray sources within the galaxy. Anisotropy is typically observed at energies above 1 TeV (teraelectronvolt) and is characterized by large-scale and small-scale structures. Large-scale anisotropy is associated with the global distribution of cosmic ray sources and the overall structure of the galactic magnetic field, while small-scale anisotropy is related to local magnetic field irregularities and individual cosmic ray sources.\n\nBy studying the anisotropy of cosmic rays, researchers can gather information about the distribution of cosmic ray sources within the galaxy. However, due to the complex nature of the magnetic fields and the deflection of cosmic rays, it is not possible to create a precise map of the cosmic ray sources based solely on the observed anisotropy. Additional information, such as the composition and energy spectrum of cosmic rays, is needed to better understand the distribution of cosmic ray sources within the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nIn summary, while the arrival direction of cosmic rays is influenced by their sources' locations and the galactic magnetic fields, the observed cosmic ray anisotropy can only provide limited information about the distribution of cosmic ray sources within the galaxy. Further studies and complementary data are required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the origin and distribution of cosmic rays in the Milky Way."
