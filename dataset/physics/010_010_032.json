    "message_1": "A 1-meter-wide cylindrical tank contains a fluid with a viscosity of 0.3 Pa·s at a temperature of 20°C. The fluid is rotating with an angular velocity of 10 rad/s. Determine the shear stress at a radius of 0.2 meters from the center of the tank using the Navier-Stokes equations.",
    "message_2": "In a rotating cylindrical tank, the fluid motion is primarily due to the rotation, and the flow is considered to be in a steady state. In this case, we can simplify the Navier-Stokes equations to the following equation for the radial component of the shear stress:\n\nτ = μ * (du/dr)\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, u is the tangential velocity of the fluid, and r is the radial distance from the center of the tank.\n\nSince the fluid is rotating with an angular velocity (ω) of 10 rad/s, we can relate the tangential velocity (u) to the angular velocity using the following equation:\n\nu = ω * r\n\nNow, we can differentiate u with respect to r:\n\ndu/dr = ω\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ, ω, and r:\n\nτ = (0.3 Pa·s) * (10 rad/s)\n\nτ = 3 Pa\n\nTherefore, the shear stress at a radius of 0.2 meters from the center of the tank is 3 Pa."
