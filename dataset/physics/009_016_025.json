    "message_2": "To find the angle of the first minimum of diffraction, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the laser beam, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the width of the slit (a) is 0.2 mm (0.2 * 10^-3 m) and the wavelength (λ) is 600 nm (600 * 10^-9 m), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 600 * 10^-9) / (0.2 * 10^-3)\n\nsin(θ) = 3 * 10^-6\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(3 * 10^-6)\n\nθ ≈ 0.0001719 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 radian = 180° / π\n\nθ ≈ 0.0001719 * (180° / π)\n\nθ ≈ 0.00985°\n\nSo, the angle of the first minimum of diffraction is approximately 0.00985°."
