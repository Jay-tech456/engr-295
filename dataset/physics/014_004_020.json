    "message_2": "The main mechanism behind the formation of galaxies is gravitational collapse. In the early universe, matter was distributed unevenly, with denser regions attracting more matter due to gravity. As these regions grew denser, they eventually collapsed under their own gravity, forming the first galaxies. This process is known as hierarchical clustering, where smaller structures merge to form larger ones over time.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and it is believed to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe.\n\nIn the early universe, dark matter served as the \"scaffolding\" for the formation of galaxies. Due to its gravitational influence, dark matter attracted baryonic matter (ordinary matter made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons) into its gravitational potential wells. These regions of higher density eventually collapsed to form the first galaxies.\n\nAs galaxies evolved, dark matter continued to play a significant role. The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies affects their rotation curves, which is the relationship between the rotational speed of stars and their distance from the galactic center. Observations show that stars in galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to keep the stars in their orbits.\n\nDark matter also influences the large-scale structure of the universe, as it forms the backbone of the cosmic web, a network of filaments and clusters of galaxies interconnected by vast cosmic voids. The distribution of dark matter in the universe affects the distribution of galaxies and their interactions, such as mergers and collisions.\n\nIn summary, dark matter plays a critical role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. It provides the gravitational foundation for galaxy formation and influences their dynamics, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe. Without dark matter, the universe and the galaxies within it would look very different from what we observe today."
