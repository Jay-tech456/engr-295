    "message_1": "A physics student is given a polarizer and a light source emitting unpolarized light. The polarizer has an axis that makes an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the direction of the incident light. What will be the intensity of the transmitted light through the polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the transmitted light through the polarizer, we can use Malus's Law. Malus's Law states that the intensity of transmitted light through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\n\nMathematically, Malus's Law is given by:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and theta is the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\n\nSince the light source emits unpolarized light, we need to consider that only half of the intensity of the incident light will be transmitted through the polarizer. Therefore, we can write:\n\nI_incident = 0.5 * I_unpolarized\n\nNow, we can substitute this into Malus's Law:\n\nI_transmitted = (0.5 * I_unpolarized) * cos^2(60 degrees)\n\nWe know that cos(60 degrees) = 0.5, so:\n\nI_transmitted = (0.5 * I_unpolarized) * (0.5)^2\n\nI_transmitted = 0.5 * I_unpolarized * 0.25\n\nI_transmitted = 0.125 * I_unpolarized\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted light through the polarizer will be 12.5% of the intensity of the unpolarized light source."
