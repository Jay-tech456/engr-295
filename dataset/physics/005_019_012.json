    "message_2": "To find the phase difference between the two electromagnetic waves, we first need to find their wavelengths and then the path difference. \n\n1. Calculate the wavelengths of the two waves:\n\nThe speed of light (c) is related to the frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) by the equation:\n\nc = f * λ\n\nFor the first wave with a frequency of 2.5×10^14 Hz:\n\nλ1 = c / f1 = (3×10^8 m/s) / (2.5×10^14 Hz) = 1.2×10^-6 m\n\nFor the second wave with a frequency of 3.0×10^14 Hz:\n\nλ2 = c / f2 = (3×10^8 m/s) / (3.0×10^14 Hz) = 1.0×10^-6 m\n\n2. Calculate the path difference:\n\nSince the waves interfere destructively, the path difference should be an odd multiple of half the wavelength (i.e., (2n+1) * λ/2, where n is an integer). Let's assume the smallest possible path difference, which corresponds to n = 0:\n\npath_difference = (2n+1) * λ1/2 - (2n+1) * λ2/2 = (2(0)+1) * (λ1 - λ2) / 2 = (λ1 - λ2) / 2 = (1.2×10^-6 m - 1.0×10^-6 m) / 2 = 0.1×10^-6 m\n\n3. Calculate the phase difference:\n\nThe phase difference (Δφ) can be calculated using the path difference and the wavelengths of the two waves:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (path_difference / λ1) = 2π * (0.1×10^-6 m / 1.2×10^-6 m) = 2π * (1/12)\n\nΔφ ≈ π/2 radians\n\nSo, the phase difference between the two electromagnetic waves is approximately π/2 radians."
