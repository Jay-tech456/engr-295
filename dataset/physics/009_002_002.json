    "message_1": "A light ray is traveling through air (n=1.00) and enters a glass (n=1.50) at an angle of incidence of 30 degrees. What is the angle of refraction of the light ray inside the glass according to Snell's Law?",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the refractive index and angle of refraction in the second medium (glass).\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nn1 = 1.00 (air)\nθ1 = 30 degrees\nn2 = 1.50 (glass)\n\nWe want to find θ2, the angle of refraction inside the glass. Rearranging Snell's Law to solve for θ2, we get:\n\nsin(θ2) = (n1 * sin(θ1)) / n2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.00 * sin(30)) / 1.50\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.00 * 0.5) / 1.50\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.50\nsin(θ2) = 1/3\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ2 whose sine is 1/3. We can use the inverse sine function (also called arcsin or sin^(-1)) to do this:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(1/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction of the light ray inside the glass is approximately 19.47 degrees."
