    "message_2": "The relationship between the applied mechanical stress and the change in DNA elongation in stretching experiments can be described using the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) model. The WLC model is a widely used polymer model that represents a semi-flexible polymer, like DNA, as a continuous, flexible, and inextensible chain. The model takes into account the bending stiffness of the polymer and the thermal fluctuations that cause the polymer to adopt various conformations.\n\nIn the WLC model, the relationship between the applied force (F) and the extension (z) of the polymer can be described by the following equation:\n\nz = L * (1 - (kT / F) * (1 / (4 * Lp) - 1 / L))\n\nWhere:\n- L is the contour length of the DNA (the total length of the DNA when fully stretched)\n- kT is the Boltzmann constant multiplied by the absolute temperature\n- Lp is the persistence length of the DNA (a measure of the DNA's bending stiffness)\n\nThe applied mechanical stress in stretching experiments is the force per unit area acting on the DNA. The change in DNA elongation is represented by the extension (z) in the WLC model. By measuring the force applied to the DNA and the resulting extension, we can use the WLC model to quantitatively describe the relationship between the applied mechanical stress and the change in DNA elongation.\n\nTo experimentally measure the force-extension relationship, techniques such as optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, or atomic force microscopy can be used. These methods allow for the precise manipulation and measurement of forces applied to single DNA molecules, enabling the direct observation of DNA elongation under various applied forces. By fitting the experimental data to the WLC model, the persistence length and contour length of the DNA can be determined, providing a quantitative description of the relationship between mechanical stress and DNA elongation."
