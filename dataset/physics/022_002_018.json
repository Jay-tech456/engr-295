    "message_2": "The currently accepted estimate of the percentage of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27%. This estimate is based on a variety of observations and measurements, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and large-scale structure formation.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can infer the composition of the universe. The data from the Planck satellite, which measures the CMB, suggests that dark matter makes up about 26.8% of the total energy density of the universe.\n\nGalaxy rotation curves are another piece of evidence for dark matter. Observations of the rotation speeds of stars in galaxies show that the speeds do not decrease as expected with distance from the galactic center. This implies the presence of an unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\nGravitational lensing, the bending of light by massive objects, also provides evidence for dark matter. Observations of the way light is bent around galaxy clusters indicate that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone.\n\nFinally, the large-scale structure of the universe, such as the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of the universe's evolution, which include dark matter, produce structures that closely resemble the observed distribution of galaxies.\n\nBy combining these lines of evidence, scientists have reached the current estimate that dark matter constitutes about 27% of the universe's total energy density."
