    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the vapor pressure of water at a certain temperature. The student has the following data: the boiling point of water at standard pressure is 100°C, and the heat of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol. What is the vapor pressure of water at a temperature of 70°C?",
    "message_2": "To determine the vapor pressure of water at a certain temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, R is the ideal gas constant, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given:\n- Boiling point of water at standard pressure (P1) = 100°C = 373.15 K\n- Standard pressure (P1) = 1 atm = 101.325 kPa\n- Heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\n- Temperature at which we want to find the vapor pressure (T2) = 70°C = 343.15 K\n- Ideal gas constant (R) = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -40700/8.314 * (1/343.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/343.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 31.2 kPa\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 70°C is approximately 31.2 kPa."
