    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the block when it is fully submerged in water, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the metal block:\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = (8 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm)\nVolume = 192 cm³\n\nNow, we need to convert the volume to m³:\n1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³\n192 cm³ = 192 / 1,000,000 m³\nVolume = 0.000192 m³\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the water displaced by the block:\nMass of water displaced = Volume × Density of water\nMass of water displaced = 0.000192 m³ × 1000 kg/m³\nMass of water displaced = 0.192 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the water displaced, which is equal to the buoyant force:\nBuoyant force = Mass of water displaced × gravitational acceleration\nBuoyant force = 0.192 kg × 9.81 m/s²\nBuoyant force ≈ 1.88 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the block when it is fully submerged in water is approximately 1.88 N."
