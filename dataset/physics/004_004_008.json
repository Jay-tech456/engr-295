The spacecraft is launched from rest at a distance of 10 Schwarzschild radii from the central object with a velocity vector pointing perpendicularly to the radial direction. What is the trajectory of the spacecraft as it moves toward the central object? What is the minimum distance between the spacecraft and the central object, and at what distance does the spacecraft reach its maximum speed?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the trajectory of the spacecraft, we will use the Schwarzschild metric, which is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the central object, c is the speed of light, and r, θ, and φ are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nSince the spacecraft is launched with a velocity vector pointing perpendicularly to the radial direction, its initial trajectory will be a circular orbit. The effective potential for a test particle in the Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nV_eff(r) = -GM/(2r) + L²/(2mr²) - GML²/(c²mr³)\n\nwhere L is the angular momentum per unit mass and m is the mass of the spacecraft.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the effective potential must have a minimum, so we differentiate V_eff(r) with respect to r and set it equal to zero:\n\ndV_eff/dr = GM/(2r²) - L²/mr³ + 3GML²/(c²mr⁴) = 0\n\nSolving for L², we get:\n\nL² = GMmr²/(1 - 3GM/c²r)\n\nNow, we can find the angular momentum per unit mass for the spacecraft at its initial position (r = 10GM/c²):\n\nL² = GMm(10GM/c²)²/(1 - 3GM/(10GM/c²)) = 100G²M²m/c⁴\n\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft can be described by the effective potential V_eff(r) with this value of L². As the spacecraft moves toward the central object, it will follow a trajectory determined by the balance of gravitational attraction and centrifugal force.\n\nTo find the minimum distance between the spacecraft and the central object, we need to find the minimum value of r for which V_eff(r) is minimized. This occurs when d²V_eff/dr² = 0. Solving this equation, we find that the minimum distance is:\n\nr_min = 4GM/c²\n\nAt this distance, the spacecraft will reach its maximum speed. To find the maximum speed, we can use the conservation of energy:\n\nE = (1/2)mv² + V_eff(r)\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the spacecraft, which is conserved along its trajectory. At r_min, the maximum speed is given by:\n\nv_max = sqrt(2(E - V_eff(r_min))/m)\n\nBy calculating v_max, we can determine the maximum speed of the spacecraft as it moves toward the central object."
