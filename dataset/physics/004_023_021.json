    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger of two black holes, we can use the formulas derived from General Relativity. \n\nFirst, let's find the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system. The total mass is the sum of the individual masses, and the reduced mass is the product of the individual masses divided by the total mass:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 30 M☉ + 40 M☉ = 70 M☉\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (30 M☉ * 40 M☉) / 70 M☉ ≈ 17.14 M☉\n\nHere, M☉ is the solar mass, which is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg.\n\nNow, let's find the frequency (f) of the emitted gravitational waves during the merger. The frequency is related to the total mass of the system:\n\nf = c^3 / (8 * π * G * M)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2). \n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf ≈ (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (8 * π * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * 70 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg)\nf ≈ 155.4 Hz\n\nThe amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves is related to the reduced mass, total mass, and distance (d) from the source:\n\nh = (4 * G * μ * M) / (c^2 * d)\n\nHowever, without knowing the distance to the black hole merger, we cannot calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves. If you provide the distance, we can calculate the amplitude. \n\nIn summary, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger of two black holes with masses of 30 solar masses and 40 solar masses is approximately 155.4 Hz. The amplitude depends on the distance to the merger event."
