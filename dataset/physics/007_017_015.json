    "message_2": "The cross section for a neutron to induce fission in a nucleus of uranium-235 varies with the energy of the incident neutron. However, for thermal neutrons (neutrons with an energy of about 0.025 eV), the fission cross section of uranium-235 is approximately 584 barns. It is important to note that this value can change depending on the specific reference and experimental data used."
