    "message_2": "To determine the minimum distance between an object and a human eye required for clear vision, we need to consider the near point of the human eye. The near point is the closest distance at which an object can be placed and still be in focus. For a typical human eye, the near point is about 25 cm (approximately 10 inches).\n\nNow, let's consider the lens formula for a thin lens:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens (2.5 cm for the human eye), u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nSince we are considering the minimum distance for clear vision, we can assume that the image is formed at the near point (v = 25 cm). Now we can solve for the object distance (u):\n\n1/2.5 = 1/u + 1/25\n1/u = 1/2.5 - 1/25\n1/u = (10 - 1)/25\n1/u = 9/25\nu = 25/9 cm\n\nSo, the minimum distance between the object (10 cm in size) and the human eye for clear vision is approximately 25/9 cm or 2.78 cm.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this calculation is based on the assumption that the object is in focus at the near point. In reality, the minimum distance for clear vision would be greater than this value, as the eye would need to accommodate for the object's size.\n\nNow, if the object's size is reduced to 5 cm, the minimum distance for clear vision would not change significantly, as the near point of the human eye remains the same. The object distance calculated above is based on the focal length of the eye's lens and the near point, which are not affected by the object's size. The eye would still need to accommodate for the smaller object, but the minimum distance for clear vision would still be around the near point of 25 cm."
