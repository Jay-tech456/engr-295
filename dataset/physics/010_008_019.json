    "message_2": "To determine the density of the solid and the volume of the liquid displaced when it is submerged in the water, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the buoyant force acting on the solid when it is submerged in water.\n2. Calculate the volume of the solid using the buoyant force and the density of water.\n3. Calculate the mass of the solid using its weight in air.\n4. Calculate the density of the solid using its mass and volume.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the buoyant force\nThe buoyant force (F_b) is the difference between the weight of the solid in air (W_air) and the weight of the solid when fully immersed in water (W_water).\n\nF_b = W_air - W_water\nF_b = 230 N - 150 N\nF_b = 80 N\n\nStep 2: Calculate the volume of the solid\nThe buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the solid, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_b = V_s * ρ_water * g\n\nwhere V_s is the volume of the solid, ρ_water is the density of water, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for V_s:\n\nV_s = F_b / (ρ_water * g)\nV_s = 80 N / (1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s²)\nV_s ≈ 0.00816 m³\n\nStep 3: Calculate the mass of the solid\nThe weight of the solid in air (W_air) is equal to the mass of the solid (m_s) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g):\n\nW_air = m_s * g\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for m_s:\n\nm_s = W_air / g\nm_s = 230 N / 9.8 m/s²\nm_s ≈ 23.47 kg\n\nStep 4: Calculate the density of the solid\nThe density of the solid (ρ_s) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nρ_s = m_s / V_s\nρ_s = 23.47 kg / 0.00816 m³\nρ_s ≈ 2876 kg/m³\n\nSo, the density of the solid is approximately 2876 kg/m³, and the volume of the liquid displaced when it is submerged in water is approximately 0.00816 m³."
