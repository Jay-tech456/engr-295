    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the two black holes in solar masses.\n2. Calculate the energy released during the collision using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.\n3. Calculate the maximum amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the collision.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total mass of the two black holes in solar masses.\nThe masses of the two black holes are given as 10 solar masses and 30 solar masses. Therefore, the total mass (M) is:\n\nM = 10 + 30 = 40 solar masses\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy released during the collision using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.\nEinstein's mass-energy equivalence formula is given by:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). We need to convert the mass from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the total mass in kilograms is:\n\nm = 40 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 7.956 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released during the collision:\n\nE = (7.956 x 10^31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 7.156 x 10^47 Joules\n\nStep 3: Calculate the maximum amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the collision.\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves (h) is related to the energy (E) and the distance (r) from the source by the following formula:\n\nh = (2 * G * E) / (c^4 * r)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2). To find the maximum amplitude, we need to consider the distance from the source. Since we are looking for the maximum amplitude, we can assume the distance to be relatively small (e.g., 1 meter).\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum amplitude of the gravitational waves:\n\nh = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (7.156 x 10^47 Joules)) / ((3 x 10^8 m/s)^4 * 1 m)\nh â‰ˆ 1.57 x 10^-21\n\nTherefore, the maximum amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the collision of two black holes with masses of 10 and 30 solar masses is approximately 1.57 x 10^-21."
