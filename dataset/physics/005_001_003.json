    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time interval experienced by the observer at rest (on Earth), Δt' is the time interval experienced by the moving observer (on the spaceship), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the spaceship is traveling at a constant velocity of 0.8c relative to Earth, and the time interval experienced by the moving observer (Δt') is 120 days. We need to find the time interval experienced by the observer on Earth (Δt).\n\nFirst, let's convert the given time interval of 120 days to seconds:\n\n120 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 10,368,000 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug the given values into the time dilation equation:\n\n10,368,000 = Δt / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n10,368,000 = Δt / √(1 - 0.64)\n\n10,368,000 = Δt / √(0.36)\n\nNow, solve for Δt:\n\nΔt = 10,368,000 * √(0.36)\n\nΔt ≈ 10,368,000 * 0.6\n\nΔt ≈ 6,220,800 seconds\n\nNow, let's convert the time interval back to days:\n\n6,220,800 seconds * (1 minute/60 seconds) * (1 hour/60 minutes) * (1 day/24 hours) ≈ 72 days\n\nSo, the time interval experienced by an observer on Earth is approximately 72 days."
