    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for a physics student to solve:\n\nA beam of unpolarized light is incident on two polarizers with their transmission axes at an angle of 45 degrees with each other. If the intensity of the light entering the first polarizer is 5 W/m², what will be the intensity of the light coming out of the second polarizer? Assume that the polarizers absorb negligible amounts of light.",
    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by half. So after passing through the first polarizer, the intensity of the light will be:\n\nI1 = (1/2) * I0 = (1/2) * 5 W/m² = 2.5 W/m²\n\nNow, the light is polarized and passes through the second polarizer, which has its transmission axis at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the first polarizer. The intensity of the light coming out of the second polarizer can be calculated using Malus's Law:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos²θ\n\nwhere I2 is the intensity of the light coming out of the second polarizer, I1 is the intensity of the light entering the second polarizer, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, θ = 45 degrees, so:\n\nI2 = 2.5 W/m² * cos²(45°)\n\nConverting degrees to radians:\n\n45° * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, calculate the intensity:\n\nI2 = 2.5 W/m² * cos²(π/4) = 2.5 W/m² * (1/2) = 1.25 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light coming out of the second polarizer is 1.25 W/m²."
