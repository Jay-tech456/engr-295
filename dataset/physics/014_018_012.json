    "message_2": "The maximum energy of cosmic rays that can be encountered by a spacecraft during a space mission is on the order of 10^20 electron volts (eV) or 16 Joules. These extremely high-energy cosmic rays are very rare, but they can pose significant risks to astronauts and spacecraft.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from various sources in the universe, such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and other high-energy astrophysical phenomena. They can cause damage to electronic systems, produce secondary radiation, and increase the risk of cancer for astronauts.\n\nTo mitigate the risks posed by cosmic rays, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Shielding: Using materials with high hydrogen content, such as polyethylene or water, can help to absorb and scatter cosmic rays, reducing their energy and potential for damage. However, shielding can also produce secondary radiation, so it must be designed carefully to minimize this effect.\n\n2. Spacecraft design: Designing spacecraft with redundant systems and fault-tolerant electronics can help to minimize the impact of cosmic ray-induced damage. Additionally, arranging critical components in a way that minimizes their exposure to cosmic rays can also be beneficial.\n\n3. Active protection: Some concepts propose using active protection systems, such as electromagnetic fields, to deflect charged particles away from the spacecraft. However, these technologies are still in the early stages of development and may not be practical for near-term missions.\n\n4. Mission planning: Limiting the duration of space missions and avoiding periods of high solar activity can help to reduce the overall exposure to cosmic rays. Additionally, missions can be planned to take advantage of the Earth's and other planetary bodies' magnetic fields, which can help to shield against cosmic rays.\n\n5. Astronaut protection: Providing astronauts with personal radiation protection, such as wearable shielding garments, can help to reduce their exposure to cosmic rays. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including exercise and a balanced diet, can help to minimize the risks associated with radiation exposure.\n\nIn summary, the maximum energy of cosmic rays that can be encountered by a spacecraft is on the order of 10^20 eV. To minimize the risks to astronauts and the spacecraft, a combination of shielding, spacecraft design, active protection, mission planning, and astronaut protection strategies can be employed."
