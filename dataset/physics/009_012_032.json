    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification produced by the lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo find the value of v, we can first find the common denominator of the fractions:\n60 = 3v + 2v\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n5v = 60\n\nDivide by 5:\nv = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 12 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12/30\n\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification produced by the lens is -0.4, which means the image is 0.4 times the size of the object and inverted (since the magnification is negative)."
