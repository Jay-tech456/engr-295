    "message_1": "A tank initially contains water with a concentration of salt molecules of 0.05 g/L. A saltwater solution with a concentration of 0.1 g/L is continuously added to the tank at a rate of 0.5 L/s, and the well-stirred mixture is withdrawn from the tank at the same rate. Calculate the concentration of salt in the tank after 120 seconds.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the concentration of salt in the tank at any time t as C(t). We are given that the initial concentration is C(0) = 0.05 g/L. The rate at which saltwater is added to the tank is 0.5 L/s, and the concentration of the added saltwater is 0.1 g/L. The well-stirred mixture is withdrawn from the tank at the same rate of 0.5 L/s.\n\nWe can set up a differential equation to describe the change in the concentration of salt in the tank over time:\n\ndC/dt = (rate_in * concentration_in - rate_out * C(t)) / V(t),\n\nwhere V(t) is the volume of the tank at time t. Since the rate_in and rate_out are the same, the volume of the tank remains constant over time. Therefore, V(t) = V(0) = V.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\ndC/dt = (0.5 * 0.1 - 0.5 * C(t)) / V.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndC / (0.1 - C) = (0.5 / V) * dt.\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-ln(0.1 - C) = (0.5 / V) * t + k,\n\nwhere k is the integration constant. To find k, we can use the initial condition C(0) = 0.05:\n\n-ln(0.1 - 0.05) = (0.5 / V) * 0 + k,\nk = -ln(0.05).\n\nNow, we can solve for C(t) after 120 seconds:\n\n-ln(0.1 - C(120)) = (0.5 / V) * 120 - ln(0.05),\n0.1 - C(120) = 0.05 * exp(-0.5 * 120 / V),\nC(120) = 0.1 - 0.05 * exp(-0.5 * 120 / V).\n\nSince the volume of the tank remains constant, we can find the concentration of salt in the tank after 120 seconds without knowing the exact volume:\n\nC(120) = 0.1 - 0.05 * exp(-60 / V).\n\nThis equation gives the concentration of salt in the tank after 120 seconds as a function of the tank's volume."
