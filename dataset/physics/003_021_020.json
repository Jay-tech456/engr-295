    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil of 250 turns and a secondary coil of 1500 turns. The primary coil is 0.1 m long and carries a current of 2 A in the clockwise direction. Calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.05 m away from the center of the primary coil. (Assume that the magnetic field is uniform over the cross-section of the coil.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.05 m away from the center of the primary coil, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (l).\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / l\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nIn this problem, the primary coil has 250 turns and carries a current of 2 A. Therefore, the total current enclosed by the loop is:\n\nI_total = N * I = 250 turns * 2 A = 500 A\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.05 m away from the center of the primary coil:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_total) / l\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 A) / 0.1 m\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) T * 500) / 0.1 m\nB = (1000π × 10^(-6) T) / 0.1 m\nB = 10π × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.05 m away from the center of the primary coil is approximately 10π × 10^(-5) T or 3.14 × 10^(-4) T."
