    "message_2": "The Debye-Hückel limiting law is used to calculate the activity coefficient (γ) of an electrolyte in a solution. The law is given by the following equation:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * |z+ * z-| * √I\n\nwhere:\nγ = activity coefficient\nA = Debye-Hückel limiting law constant\nz+ = charge of the cation (Na+)\nz- = charge of the anion (Cl-)\nI = ionic strength of the solution\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the ionic strength (I) of the solution. For a 1:1 electrolyte like NaCl, the ionic strength can be calculated as:\n\nI = 1/2 * (c * (z+^2 + z-^2))\n\nwhere c is the concentration of the electrolyte (0.1 mol/L in this case).\n\nFor NaCl, the charges of the ions are:\nz+ = +1 (for Na+)\nz- = -1 (for Cl-)\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionic strength:\n\nI = 1/2 * (0.1 * (1^2 + (-1)^2))\nI = 1/2 * (0.1 * (1 + 1))\nI = 1/2 * (0.1 * 2)\nI = 0.1\n\nNow, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law to calculate the activity coefficient:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * |z+ * z-| * √I\nlog(γ) = -0.508 * |(+1) * (-1)| * √0.1\nlog(γ) = -0.508 * 1 * 0.3162\nlog(γ) = -0.1606\n\nNow, we can find the activity coefficient (γ) by taking the antilog:\n\nγ = 10^(-0.1606)\nγ ≈ 0.69\n\nSo, the activity coefficient (γ) of the 0.1 mol/L NaCl solution at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is approximately 0.69."
