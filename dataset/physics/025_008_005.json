    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Hooke's Law and the definition of Young's modulus. Hooke's Law states that the force (F) required to stretch a material is proportional to the elongation (ΔL) and the stiffness (k) of the material:\n\nF = k * ΔL\n\nYoung's modulus (E) is a measure of the stiffness of a material and is defined as the ratio of stress (σ) to strain (ε):\n\nE = σ / ε\n\nStress is the force (F) applied to a material divided by its cross-sectional area (A):\n\nσ = F / A\n\nStrain is the elongation (ΔL) divided by the original length (L₀) of the material:\n\nε = ΔL / L₀\n\nWe can rearrange the equation for Young's modulus to solve for the force:\n\nF = A * E * ε\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nL₀ = 10 micrometers = 10 * 10^(-6) meters\nΔL = 12 - 10 = 2 micrometers = 2 * 10^(-6) meters\nA = 1 square micrometer = 1 * 10^(-12) square meters\nE = 5 GPa = 5 * 10^9 Pa\n\nFirst, we need to find the strain (ε):\n\nε = ΔL / L₀ = (2 * 10^(-6) m) / (10 * 10^(-6) m) = 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the force (F):\n\nF = A * E * ε = (1 * 10^(-12) m²) * (5 * 10^9 Pa) * 0.2\n\nF = 1 * 10^(-12) * 5 * 10^9 * 0.2 N\nF = 1 * 10^(-3) N\n\nThe force required to stretch the muscle fiber from 10 micrometers to 12 micrometers is 1 * 10^(-3) N, or 1 mN (millinewton)."
