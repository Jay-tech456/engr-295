    "message_2": "To calculate the skin friction coefficient (Cf) at a given point in a laminar boundary layer, we can use the Blasius formula:\n\nCf = 0.664 / sqrt(Re_x)\n\nwhere Re_x is the Reynolds number at the given distance (x) from the leading edge. The Reynolds number is defined as:\n\nRe_x = (ρ * V * x) / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, x is the distance from the leading edge, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Reynolds number at x = 0.6 m. To do this, we can use the relationship between the boundary layer thickness (δ) and the Reynolds number for laminar flow:\n\nδ = (5 * x) / sqrt(Re_x)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Re_x:\n\nRe_x = (5 * x / δ)^2\n\nPlugging in the given values for x and δ:\n\nRe_x = (5 * 0.6 / 0.02)^2\nRe_x ≈ 45000\n\nNow that we have the Reynolds number, we can calculate the skin friction coefficient using the Blasius formula:\n\nCf = 0.664 / sqrt(45000)\nCf ≈ 0.00313\n\nSo, the skin friction coefficient at a distance of 0.6 m from the leading edge is approximately 0.00313."
