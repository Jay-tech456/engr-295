    "message_1": "A cylindrical transformer has a radius of 10 cm and a length of 20 cm. If it carries a current of 5 A, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the transformer and at a distance of 5 cm from the center? Assume the transformer has a vacuum core.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the transformer and at a distance of 5 cm from the center, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) passing through the loop.\n\nMathematically, it can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a cylindrical transformer, the magnetic field is symmetrical and parallel to the length of the cylinder. Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius r (5 cm) inside the transformer. The circumference of this loop is 2πr.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field (B) inside the transformer:\n\nB⋅(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nWhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current = 5 A\nr = distance from the center = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 5 A) / (2π × 0.05 m)\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.05 m\n\nB = 4 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field inside the transformer and at a distance of 5 cm from the center is 4 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
