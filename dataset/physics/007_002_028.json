    "message_1": "A radioactive sample has an initial mass of 200 grams and has a half-life of 10 days. After 30 days, what is the mass of the sample remaining?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 200 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 25 grams\n\nSo after 30 days, the mass of the radioactive sample remaining is 25 grams."
