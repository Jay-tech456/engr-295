    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/di\n\nNow, simplify and solve for di:\n\n50 / 600 = 1/di\n\ndi = 600 / 50\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is 12 cm.\n\nNow, to find the image height (hi), we can use the magnification equation:\n\nM = hi/ho = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, hi is the image height, and ho is the object height.\n\nWe don't have the object height (ho) given, so let's express the image height (hi) in terms of the object height (ho):\n\nhi = -di/do * ho\n\nSubstitute the values of di and do:\n\nhi = -12/30 * ho\n\nhi = -2/5 * ho\n\nThe image height (hi) is -2/5 times the object height (ho). The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted compared to the object."
