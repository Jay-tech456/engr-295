    "message_2": "The mass and angular momentum of a collapsing star play crucial roles in the formation and evolution of a black hole. When a massive star (with a mass greater than about three times the mass of the Sun) reaches the end of its life, it can no longer produce enough nuclear fusion to support its own weight. This leads to a gravitational collapse, where the core of the star contracts under its own gravity.\n\nThe relationship between the initial conditions of a collapsing star and the final size and properties of the resulting black hole can be understood through two key factors: mass and angular momentum.\n\n1. Mass: The mass of the collapsing star determines the mass of the resulting black hole. According to the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, a star with a mass greater than about three times the mass of the Sun can potentially form a black hole. The more massive the star, the more massive the resulting black hole will be. The mass of the black hole is directly related to its event horizon's size (also known as the Schwarzschild radius), which is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\n2. Angular Momentum: The angular momentum of the collapsing star determines the rotation of the resulting black hole. A rotating black hole is known as a Kerr black hole. The rotation of the black hole affects its properties, such as the size and shape of the event horizon and the ergosphere (a region outside the event horizon where objects can still be affected by the black hole's rotation). The faster the initial star rotates, the faster the resulting black hole will rotate. The rotation parameter (a) of a Kerr black hole is given by the formula a = J/Mc, where J is the angular momentum of the black hole, M is its mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn summary, the mass and angular momentum of a collapsing star determine the formation and evolution of a black hole by influencing its mass, rotation, and the size and shape of its event horizon and ergosphere. The more massive the initial star, the more massive the resulting black hole, and the larger its event horizon. The faster the initial star rotates, the faster the resulting black hole will rotate, affecting the properties of its event horizon and ergosphere."
