    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino changing its flavor from an electron neutrino to a muon neutrino, we need to consider neutrino oscillations. Neutrino oscillations are a quantum mechanical phenomenon where neutrinos can change their flavor as they propagate through space. The probability of this flavor change depends on the mixing angles, mass differences, and the distance traveled by the neutrino.\n\nThe probability of an electron neutrino (νe) changing into a muon neutrino (νμ) can be expressed as:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- θ is the mixing angle between the electron and muon neutrino states\n- Δm² is the difference in the squares of the masses of the two neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km)\n- E is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nFor this problem, we are given the distance L = 350 km and a specific energy E. However, we need the values of the mixing angle θ and the mass difference Δm² to calculate the probability.\n\nThe current best-fit values for the mixing angle θ and mass difference Δm² from experimental data are:\n\nθ ≈ 33.82° (θ ≈ 0.5905 radians)\nΔm² ≈ 7.39 × 10⁻³ eV²\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2 * 0.5905) * sin²(1.27 * 7.39 × 10⁻³ * 350 / E)\n\nTo solve this problem for a specific energy E, simply plug in the value of E (in GeV) into the equation and calculate the probability. Note that the probability will vary depending on the energy of the neutrino."
