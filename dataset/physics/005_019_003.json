    "message_1": "A beam of light with a wavelength of 600 nm is travelling to the right and interferes with another beam of light travelling in the opposite direction with the same wavelength. What is the distance between two nodes of destructive interference in the resulting standing wave pattern? (Assume that light speed is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s and the frequency of the light is 5.0 x 10^14 Hz).",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between two nodes of destructive interference in the resulting standing wave pattern, we first need to determine the wavelength of the standing wave.\n\nSince the two beams of light have the same wavelength and are traveling in opposite directions, they will create a standing wave pattern with a half-wavelength difference between nodes of destructive interference. \n\nThe given wavelength of the light beams is 600 nm, which is equal to 600 x 10^-9 m. \n\nThe wavelength of the standing wave pattern will be half of the original wavelength:\n\nStanding wave wavelength = (1/2) * original wavelength\nStanding wave wavelength = (1/2) * 600 x 10^-9 m\nStanding wave wavelength = 300 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between two nodes of destructive interference. In a standing wave pattern, the distance between two consecutive nodes is half of the standing wave wavelength:\n\nDistance between two nodes = (1/2) * standing wave wavelength\nDistance between two nodes = (1/2) * 300 x 10^-9 m\nDistance between two nodes = 150 x 10^-9 m\n\nSo, the distance between two nodes of destructive interference in the resulting standing wave pattern is 150 nm or 150 x 10^-9 m."
