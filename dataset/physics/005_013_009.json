    "message_1": "A particle with a rest mass of 2.5 kg is moving towards another stationary particle with a rest mass of 4 kg, both at rest relative to an observer. They collide and stick together, creating one particle. What is the final velocity of the combined particle if the collision is completely inelastic? (Assume the speed of light is infinite for simplicity.)",
    "message_2": "In a completely inelastic collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common final velocity. To find the final velocity, we can use the conservation of linear momentum. The linear momentum before the collision is equal to the linear momentum after the collision.\n\nInitial linear momentum = Final linear momentum\n\nLet's denote the initial velocity of the 2.5 kg particle as v1 and the initial velocity of the 4 kg particle as v2. Since the 4 kg particle is stationary, v2 = 0. The final velocity of the combined particle will be denoted as vf.\n\nInitial linear momentum = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\nFinal linear momentum = (m1 + m2) * vf\n\nwhere m1 = 2.5 kg, m2 = 4 kg.\n\nConserving linear momentum, we have:\n\nm1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = (m1 + m2) * vf\n\nWe need the initial velocity (v1) of the 2.5 kg particle to solve for the final velocity (vf). Please provide the initial velocity of the 2.5 kg particle."
