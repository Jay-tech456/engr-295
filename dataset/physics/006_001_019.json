    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required for the transition from n=3 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (Z=1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the initial state (n=3):\n\nE_initial = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 3^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/9) = -1.51 eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy of the final state (n=1):\n\nE_final = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/1) = -13.6 eV\n\nNow we can find the energy difference:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = -13.6 eV - (-1.51 eV) = -12.09 eV\n\nThe energy required to transition from the n=3 state to the n=1 state is 12.09 eV."
