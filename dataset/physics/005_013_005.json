    "message_1": "A particle with mass m1 and velocity v1 collides elastically with another particle with mass m2 and velocity v2. If the collision angle is 90 degrees, what are the final velocities of the particles in terms of their masses and initial velocities?",
    "message_2": "In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's denote the final velocities of the particles as v1' and v2' respectively. Since the collision angle is 90 degrees, we can analyze the momentum conservation in the x and y directions separately.\n\nLet's assume that the initial velocities of the particles are in the x-direction, and after the collision, the particles have velocities in both x and y directions. We can write the momentum conservation equations as follows:\n\n1. Momentum conservation in the x-direction:\nm1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = m1 * v1'x + m2 * v2'x\n\n2. Momentum conservation in the y-direction:\n0 = m1 * v1'y + m2 * v2'y\n\nNow, we also have the conservation of kinetic energy:\n(1/2) * m1 * v1^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2^2 = (1/2) * m1 * (v1'x^2 + v1'y^2) + (1/2) * m2 * (v2'x^2 + v2'y^2)\n\nWe can simplify the kinetic energy conservation equation as:\nm1 * v1^2 + m2 * v2^2 = m1 * (v1'x^2 + v1'y^2) + m2 * (v2'x^2 + v2'y^2)\n\nNow, we have 3 equations and 4 unknowns (v1'x, v1'y, v2'x, v2'y). To solve for the final velocities, we can use the fact that the collision angle is 90 degrees. This means that the angle between the final velocities of the two particles is 90 degrees. We can write this condition using the dot product of the final velocities:\n\nv1'x * v2'x + v1'y * v2'y = 0\n\nNow we have 4 equations and 4 unknowns. Solving this system of equations is quite complex and involves a lot of algebra. However, the final expressions for the components of the final velocities are:\n\nv1'x = (v1 * (m1 - m2) + 2 * m2 * v2) / (m1 + m2)\nv1'y = (2 * m1 * m2 * (v1 - v2)) / (m1 + m2)^2\n\nv2'x = (v2 * (m2 - m1) + 2 * m1 * v1) / (m1 + m2)\nv2'y = (2 * m1 * m2 * (v2 - v1)) / (m1 + m2)^2\n\nThese expressions give the components of the final velocities in terms of the masses and initial velocities of the particles."
