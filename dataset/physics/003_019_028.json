    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor of radius $r_1$ and an outer conductor of radius $r_2$. A current of magnitude $I$ is passed through the inner conductor in the direction of the axis of the cable. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the cable, where $r_1 < r < r_2$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the cable, where $r_1 < r < r_2$, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space $\\mu_0$ and the total current enclosed by the loop, i.e.,\n\n$$\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enclosed}$$\n\nWe consider a circular loop of radius $r$ centered on the axis of the cable. The magnetic field at this distance will be tangential to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral simplifies to\n\n$$B \\oint dl = B(2\\pi r)$$\n\nSince the loop is inside the outer conductor, the only current enclosed by the loop is the current $I$ in the inner conductor. Thus, we have\n\n$$B(2\\pi r) = \\mu_0 I$$\n\nSolving for the magnetic field magnitude $B$, we get\n\n$$B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$$\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the axis of the cable), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in the azimuthal direction, i.e., tangential to the circular loop.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the cable, where $r_1 < r < r_2$, is $\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$, and its direction is azimuthal (tangential to the circular loop)."
