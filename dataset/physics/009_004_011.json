    "message_1": "A physics student is given a medium with a refractive index of 1.5 and is asked to find the critical angle of incidence when light travels from this medium to air, which has a refractive index of 1. How would you calculate the critical angle?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (θ1) to the sine of the angle of refraction (θ2) is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the critical angle (θc) at which the light is refracted at an angle of 90 degrees (θ2 = 90°) when it travels from the medium with a refractive index of 1.5 (n1) to air with a refractive index of 1 (n2).\n\nAt the critical angle, sin(θ2) = sin(90°) = 1. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\n1.5 * sin(θc) = 1 * 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle θc:\n\nsin(θc) = 1 / 1.5\nθc = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence when light travels from the medium with a refractive index of 1.5 to air is approximately 41.81 degrees."
