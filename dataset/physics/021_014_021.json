    "message_2": "A quasar, short for \"quasi-stellar radio source,\" is an extremely bright and distant celestial object powered by a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. The presence of a supermassive black hole creates and sustains an active quasar through a process called accretion.\n\nThe mechanism behind this phenomenon involves the following steps:\n\n1. Accretion disk formation: As the supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy attracts nearby gas, dust, and other matter, this material forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The accretion disk is a rotating, flattened structure where the matter spirals inwards towards the black hole.\n\n2. Friction and heating: As the matter in the accretion disk moves closer to the black hole, it experiences increasing gravitational forces, causing the particles to collide and rub against each other. This friction generates a tremendous amount of heat, causing the disk to emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, X-rays, and radio waves.\n\n3. Relativistic jets: In some cases, a portion of the infalling matter is redirected away from the black hole and ejected in the form of high-speed, narrow jets. These jets, known as relativistic jets, travel at velocities close to the speed of light and can extend for thousands of light-years. The exact mechanism behind the formation of these jets is still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the interaction of the black hole's strong magnetic field with the surrounding accretion disk.\n\n4. Quasar activity: The combination of the intense radiation emitted by the accretion disk and the relativistic jets results in the extremely bright and energetic phenomenon known as a quasar. Quasars can outshine entire galaxies and are visible across vast cosmic distances.\n\n5. Sustaining the quasar: The quasar remains active as long as there is a sufficient supply of matter to fuel the accretion process. Over time, the black hole may consume most of the nearby material, causing the quasar to become less active or even dormant. However, if new sources of gas and dust are introduced to the vicinity of the black hole, the accretion process can resume, and the quasar can become active once again.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy creates and sustains an active quasar through the process of accretion. The intense radiation emitted by the heated accretion disk and the powerful relativistic jets contribute to the extreme brightness and energy of a quasar."
