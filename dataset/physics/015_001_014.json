    "message_1": "What is the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system consisting of two black holes with masses m1 = 30 solar masses and m2 = 20 solar masses that are located 1 billion light-years away from Earth and orbit each other every 5 hours with an eccentricity of 0.5?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * a) / (c^4 * r)\n\nwhere:\n- h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes\n- a is the semi-major axis of the binary system\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- r is the distance from the binary system to Earth\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the semi-major axis (a) of the binary system. We can use Kepler's Third Law to do this:\n\nP^2 = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere P is the orbital period. We are given that the binary system orbits each other every 5 hours. We need to convert this to seconds:\n\nP = 5 hours * 3600 s/hour = 18000 s\n\nNow, we can solve for a:\n\na^3 = (P^2 * G * (M1 + M2)) / (4 * π^2)\na = ((P^2 * G * (M1 + M2)) / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)\n\na = ((18000^2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 * (5.967 x 10^31 + 3.978 x 10^31)) / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)\na ≈ 2.384 x 10^11 m\n\nFinally, we need to convert the distance from the binary system to Earth from 1 billion light-years to meters:\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^15 m\nr = 1 billion light-years * 9.461 x 10^15 m/light-year = 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational wave:\n\nh = (4 * (6.67430 x 10^-11)^2 * 5.967 x 10^31 * 3.978 x 10^31 * 2.384 x 10^11) / ((2.998 x 10^8)^4 * 9.461 x 10^24)\nh ≈ 1.22 x 10^-22\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system is approximately 1.22 x 10^-22."
