    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of the mixture, we can use the mass-weighted average of the specific heat capacities of the individual components (ethanol and water). The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of ethanol (C2H5OH) at 25°C is approximately 2.44 J/g°C, and the specific heat capacity of water (H2O) at 25°C is approximately 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nLet's denote the mass fraction of ethanol as x and the mass fraction of water as y. In this case, x = 0.4 (40% ethanol) and y = 0.6 (60% water).\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the mixture (C_mix) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nC_mix = x * C_ethanol + y * C_water\n\nC_mix = (0.4 * 2.44 J/g°C) + (0.6 * 4.18 J/g°C)\n\nC_mix = 0.976 J/g°C + 2.508 J/g°C\n\nC_mix ≈ 3.484 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the mixture composed of 40% ethanol and 60% water by mass at 25°C and 1 atm is approximately 3.484 J/g°C."
