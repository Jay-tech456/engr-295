    "message_2": "Since the particle is moving with a constant velocity of 0.8c in the x-direction, its trajectory will be a straight line along the x-axis. The position of the particle at any time t can be determined using the equation:\n\nx(t) = x0 + v*t\n\nwhere x0 is the initial position of the particle (which is 0 in this case), v is the velocity of the particle (0.8c), and t is the time.\n\nSo, the equation for the trajectory of the particle as seen by a stationary observer is:\n\nx(t) = 0 + (0.8c)*t\nx(t) = 0.8c*t\n\nSince the particle is only moving in the x-direction, its y and z coordinates will remain constant at 0:\n\ny(t) = 0\nz(t) = 0\n\nThus, the trajectory of the particle as seen by a stationary observer is given by:\n\nx(t) = 0.8c*t, y(t) = 0, z(t) = 0"
