    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to transition an electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n1 = 1) to its first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E2 - E1 = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E1 and E2 are the energies of the initial and final states, and n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states.\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n2:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1) = -13.6 eV * (-3/4)\n\nΔE = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to transition an electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state to its first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
