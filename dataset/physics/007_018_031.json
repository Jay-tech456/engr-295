    "message_2": "To determine the cross-section of the 238U (n,2n) reaction at neutron energies ranging from 10 keV to 20 MeV, we can use the ENDF (Evaluated Nuclear Data File) library, which contains evaluated cross-section data for various nuclear reactions. The ENDF library is maintained by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) and is widely used by the nuclear physics community.\n\nTo access the ENDF library, you can use the JANIS (Java-based Nuclear Data Information System) software, which is a user-friendly interface for browsing and retrieving nuclear data from various databases, including ENDF. You can download JANIS from the following link: https://www.oecd-nea.org/janis/\n\nAfter installing JANIS, follow these steps to obtain the cross-section data for the 238U (n,2n) reaction:\n\n1. Open JANIS and click on \"ENDF/B-VIII.0\" under the \"Libraries\" tab.\n2. In the \"Nuclides\" tab, scroll down and select \"U-238.\"\n3. In the \"Reactions\" tab, scroll down and select the \"(n,2n)\" reaction.\n4. In the \"Energy range\" tab, set the minimum energy to 10 keV and the maximum energy to 20 MeV.\n5. Click on \"Plot\" to display the cross-section data as a function of neutron energy.\n\nThe resulting plot will show the cross-section of the 238U (n,2n) reaction as a function of neutron energy in the specified range. You can also export the data to a file for further analysis.\n\nTo validate the calculated cross-section values, you can compare them with experimental data from a reliable source, such as the EXFOR (Experimental Nuclear Reaction Data) database, which is also maintained by the NNDC. In JANIS, you can access the EXFOR database by clicking on \"EXFOR\" under the \"Libraries\" tab and following similar steps as described above for the ENDF library.\n\nBy comparing the calculated cross-section values from the ENDF library with the experimental data from the EXFOR database, you can assess the accuracy and reliability of the cross-section data for the 238U (n,2n) reaction at neutron energies ranging from 10 keV to 20 MeV."
