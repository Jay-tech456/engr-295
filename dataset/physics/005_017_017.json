    "message_2": "To calculate the particle's trajectory in the x-y plane as observed by the observer, we need to find the components of the particle's velocity in the x and y directions. \n\nGiven that the particle's speed is 0.8c (where c is the speed of light) and its trajectory is at an angle of 45 degrees to the x-axis, we can use trigonometry to find the x and y components of the velocity.\n\nVelocity in x-direction (Vx) = (0.8c) * cos(45°)\nVelocity in y-direction (Vy) = (0.8c) * sin(45°)\n\nSince cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2 / 2, we can plug these values into the equations:\n\nVx = (0.8c) * (√2 / 2)\nVy = (0.8c) * (√2 / 2)\n\nVx = 0.4√2 * c\nVy = 0.4√2 * c\n\nNow, we have the components of the particle's velocity in the x and y directions. The particle's trajectory in the x-y plane can be represented by the parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = Vx * t\ny(t) = Vy * t\n\nx(t) = (0.4√2 * c) * t\ny(t) = (0.4√2 * c) * t\n\nThese parametric equations describe the particle's trajectory in the x-y plane as observed by the observer."
