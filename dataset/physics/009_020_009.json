    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 3000 lines per centimeter. A monochromatic light is incident on the grating and a diffraction pattern is formed on a screen placed behind the grating. The first-order maximum of the diffraction pattern is observed at an angle of 30° from the incident beam. What is the wavelength of the incident light?",
    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the incident light, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the maximum (in this case, n = 1 for the first-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the incident light, d is the distance between adjacent slits in the grating, and θ is the angle between the incident beam and the maximum.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between adjacent slits (d). Since there are 3000 lines per centimeter, we can convert this to meters and find the distance between the lines:\n\n3000 lines/cm * (1 cm / 10000 lines) = 3 * 10^5 lines/m\n\nNow, we can find the distance between adjacent slits:\n\nd = 1 / (3 * 10^5 lines/m) = 1 / 3 * 10^-5 m\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the wavelength of the incident light:\n\n1 * λ = (1 / 3 * 10^-5 m) * sin(30°)\n\nλ = (1 / 3 * 10^-5 m) * 0.5\n\nλ = 0.5 / 3 * 10^-5 m\n\nλ = 1.67 * 10^-5 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the incident light is approximately 1.67 * 10^-5 m or 16.7 nm."
