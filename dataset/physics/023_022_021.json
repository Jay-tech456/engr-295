    "message_2": "The expected hitting time for a quantum walker using Grover's search algorithm in quantum computing with quantum walks depends on the size of the graph and the specific structure of the graph. Grover's search algorithm can be used to search an unsorted database of N items in O(sqrt(N)) time, which is a quadratic speedup compared to classical search algorithms.\n\nIn the context of quantum walks, this speedup can be translated to the expected hitting time. For a classical random walk on a graph with N vertices, the expected hitting time to reach a target vertex is typically on the order of O(N). However, for a quantum walk using Grover's search algorithm, the expected hitting time can be reduced to O(sqrt(N)).\n\nThis quadratic speedup is a significant advantage of quantum walks over classical random walks, particularly for large graphs. However, it is important to note that the actual hitting time will depend on the specific graph structure and the initial and target vertices. In some cases, the quantum walk may not exhibit a significant speedup over the classical random walk, while in other cases, the speedup may be even greater than the quadratic improvement provided by Grover's search algorithm."
