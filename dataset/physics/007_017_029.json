    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section for the (n,γ) reaction on Carbon-12 at an incoming neutron energy of 2 MeV, we will use the compound nucleus mechanism. In this mechanism, the neutron is first captured by the target nucleus to form a compound nucleus, which then decays by emitting a gamma-ray photon.\n\nThe cross-section for this reaction can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσ(n,γ) = (2Jc + 1) / (2Jt + 1) * σabs\n\nwhere σ(n,γ) is the cross-section for the (n,γ) reaction, Jc is the spin of the compound nucleus, Jt is the spin of the target nucleus, and σabs is the absorption cross-section.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the spins of the target nucleus (Carbon-12) and the compound nucleus (Carbon-13). Carbon-12 has a spin of 0 (even-even nucleus), and Carbon-13 has a spin of 1/2 (odd-even nucleus).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nσ(n,γ) = (2 * (1/2) + 1) / (2 * 0 + 1) * σabs\nσ(n,γ) = (2) / (1) * σabs\nσ(n,γ) = 2 * σabs\n\nNext, we need to calculate the absorption cross-section, σabs. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nσabs = πλ² * Γn * Γγ / [(E - Ec)² + (Γ/2)²]\n\nwhere λ is the neutron wavelength, Γn is the neutron width, Γγ is the gamma-ray width, E is the incoming neutron energy, Ec is the energy of the compound nucleus, and Γ is the total width.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the neutron wavelength, λ. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nλ = h / √(2 * m * E)\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), m is the neutron mass (1.675 x 10^(-27) kg), and E is the incoming neutron energy (2 MeV = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J).\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / √(2 * (1.675 x 10^(-27) kg) * (3.204 x 10^(-13) J))\nλ ≈ 2.95 x 10^(-15) m\n\nNow, we need to determine the values of Γn, Γγ, E, Ec, and Γ. These values are typically obtained from experimental data or nuclear models. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the following values:\n\nΓn = 1 keV = 1.602 x 10^(-16) J\nΓγ = 10 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-18) J\nE = 2 MeV = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J\nEc = 2 MeV = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J (assuming the compound nucleus is formed at the same energy as the incoming neutron)\nΓ = Γn + Γγ = 1.602 x 10^(-16) J + 1.602 x 10^(-18) J ≈ 1.602 x 10^(-16) J\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for σabs:\n\nσabs = π(2.95 x 10^(-15) m)² * (1.602 x 10^(-16) J) * (1.602 x 10^(-18) J) / [(3.204 x 10^(-13) J - 3.204 x 10^(-13) J)² + ((1.602 x 10^(-16) J)/2)²]\nσabs ≈ 1.35 x 10^(-30) m²\n\nFinally, we can plug this value into the formula for σ(n,γ):\n\nσ(n,γ) = 2 * (1.35 x 10^(-30) m²)\nσ(n,γ) ≈ 2.70 x 10^(-30) m²\n\nSo, the cross-section for the (n,γ) reaction on Carbon-12 at an incoming neutron energy of 2 MeV is approximately 2.70 x 10^(-30) m²."
