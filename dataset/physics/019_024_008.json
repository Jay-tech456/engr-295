    "message_2": "The origin of Hawking radiation from non-extremal rotating black holes in quantum field theory can be understood through the process of black hole evaporation and the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetime.\n\nHawking radiation is a theoretical process by which black holes can lose mass and eventually evaporate. This phenomenon is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who first proposed it in 1974. The key idea behind Hawking radiation is the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nIn quantum field theory, particles and antiparticles can spontaneously form and annihilate each other in a vacuum. This process is known as vacuum fluctuations or virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. When these fluctuations occur near the event horizon of a black hole, one of the particles can be captured by the black hole while the other escapes. This escaping particle is observed as Hawking radiation.\n\nFor non-extremal rotating black holes, the situation is slightly more complicated due to the presence of the ergosphere, a region outside the event horizon where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime along with it. In this region, particles can acquire negative energy relative to an observer at infinity. When a virtual particle-antiparticle pair forms near the event horizon, one of the particles can fall into the black hole while the other escapes. If the escaping particle has negative energy, it effectively reduces the mass of the black hole, leading to the evaporation process.\n\nThe origin of Hawking radiation from non-extremal rotating black holes in quantum field theory is thus a result of the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity, specifically the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetime near the event horizon and the ergosphere of a rotating black hole."
