    "message_2": "The large-scale structure of the universe refers to the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on cosmological scales. The typical size scale of these structures can be characterized by the distance between galaxy clusters, which is on the order of tens of millions of light-years (Mpc, where 1 Mpc = 3.26 million light-years). \n\nOne way to quantify the large-scale structure is through the correlation function, which measures the excess probability of finding a galaxy at a certain distance from another galaxy compared to a random distribution. The correlation function shows a peak at a scale of around 5 Mpc, which is often referred to as the \"correlation length.\" This scale represents the typical distance between galaxies or galaxy groups.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter throughout the universe plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary (baryonic) matter makes up only about 5%. Due to its gravitational influence, dark matter drives the formation of structures in the universe.\n\nIn the early universe, small fluctuations in the density of dark matter and baryonic matter led to the formation of dark matter halos, which are regions where dark matter is more concentrated. These halos attracted baryonic matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The distribution of dark matter halos essentially determines the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe.\n\nThe large-scale structure of the universe can be described as a \"cosmic web,\" consisting of filaments, walls, and voids. Filaments are elongated structures containing galaxy clusters and groups, while walls are sheet-like structures containing galaxies, and voids are relatively empty regions. This cosmic web is primarily shaped by the distribution of dark matter and its gravitational influence on the formation and evolution of structures in the universe."
