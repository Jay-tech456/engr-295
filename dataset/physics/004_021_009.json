    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. It is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the star has a mass of 3 solar masses, we first need to convert this to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so 3 solar masses would be:\n\n3 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 5.967 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula for the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.967 × 10^30 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 8.856 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a star with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,856 meters (or about 8.856 kilometers). This means that the star would need to be compressed to a size smaller than this radius (8.856 kilometers) to become a black hole."
