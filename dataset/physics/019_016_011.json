    "message_2": "The chiral anomaly in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) with massless fermions is a phenomenon where the conservation of the axial-vector current is violated due to quantum effects. The Fujikawa method is a powerful technique to calculate the chiral anomaly using the path integral formulation of quantum field theory. Here, we provide a step-by-step solution to calculate the chiral anomaly in QED with massless fermions using the Fujikawa method.\n\nStep 1: Define the axial-vector current\nThe axial-vector current, j^5_μ(x), is defined as:\nj^5_μ(x) = ψ̄(x) γ_μ γ^5 ψ(x)\n\nwhere ψ(x) is the massless fermion field, γ_μ are the Dirac matrices, and γ^5 is the chiral gamma matrix.\n\nStep 2: Write down the path integral for the generating functional\nThe generating functional, Z, is given by the path integral over the fermion fields:\nZ = ∫ [dψ][dψ̄] exp(i ∫ d^4x ψ̄(x) (iγ^μ ∂_μ) ψ(x))\n\nStep 3: Introduce the Fujikawa regularization\nTo regulate the path integral, we introduce a regularization by inserting a unity in the form of a Gaussian integral:\n1 = ∫ [dφ] exp(-∫ d^4x φ(x) Δ φ(x))\n\nwhere Δ is the covariant Laplacian operator, and φ(x) is an auxiliary scalar field.\n\nStep 4: Perform the chiral transformation\nPerform a chiral transformation on the fermion fields:\nψ(x) → exp(iα(x) γ^5) ψ(x)\nψ̄(x) → ψ̄(x) exp(iα(x) γ^5)\n\nUnder this transformation, the axial-vector current changes as:\nδj^5_μ(x) = ∂_μ α(x)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the change in the generating functional\nUnder the chiral transformation, the generating functional changes as:\nδZ = i ∫ d^4x α(x) ∂_μ ⟨j^5_μ(x)⟩\n\nwhere ⟨j^5_μ(x)⟩ is the expectation value of the axial-vector current.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the Jacobian of the transformation\nThe change in the generating functional is related to the Jacobian of the chiral transformation. Using the Fujikawa method, we can evaluate the Jacobian as:\nJ = exp(∫ d^4x α(x) A(x))\n\nwhere A(x) is the chiral anomaly.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the chiral anomaly\nBy comparing the change in the generating functional (Step 5) and the Jacobian (Step 6), we can determine the chiral anomaly:\nA(x) = - (e^2 / 16π^2) F_μν(x) F̃^μν(x)\n\nwhere F_μν(x) is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, and F̃^μν(x) is its dual tensor.\n\nStep 8: Obtain the anomalous divergence of the axial-vector current\nFinally, we can obtain the anomalous divergence of the axial-vector current:\n∂_μ j^5_μ(x) = A(x) = - (e^2 / 16π^2) F_μν(x) F̃^μν(x)\n\nThis result shows that the conservation of the axial-vector current is violated due to the chiral anomaly in QED with massless fermions."
