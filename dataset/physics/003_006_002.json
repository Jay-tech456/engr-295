    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nSince there are 10 turns in the coil, the total magnetic field will be 10 times the magnetic field due to a single loop.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values:\n\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nI = 2 A\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to a single loop:\n\nB_single = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB_single ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, let's find the total magnetic field due to the 10-turn coil:\n\nB_total = 10 * B_single\nB_total ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field created by the 10-turn circular coil at a point located 10 cm away from the center of the coil is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-6) T."
