    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment is a classic experiment in physics that provides evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms. It was first performed by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, and it involves the inelastic collision of electrons with mercury atoms.\n\nIn the experiment, electrons are accelerated through a vacuum tube containing mercury vapor by applying an accelerating voltage. As the electrons gain kinetic energy, they collide with mercury atoms. If the energy of the electron is sufficient, it can excite the mercury atom to a higher energy level. This process is called inelastic collision, as the electron loses some of its kinetic energy to the mercury atom.\n\nWhen the accelerating voltage is varied, the kinetic energy of the electrons changes. If the kinetic energy of the electron is not enough to excite the mercury atom, the electron will simply bounce off the atom in an elastic collision, retaining its kinetic energy. However, when the accelerating voltage reaches a specific value, the kinetic energy of the electron becomes sufficient to excite the mercury atom to a higher energy level. This results in a sudden increase in the number of inelastic collisions and a corresponding decrease in the number of electrons reaching the detector.\n\nAs the accelerating voltage is increased further, the electrons gain enough energy to excite the mercury atoms to even higher energy levels, resulting in additional peaks in the current measured at the detector. These peaks occur at specific accelerating voltage values, corresponding to the energy differences between the quantized energy levels of the mercury atoms.\n\nThe effect of varying the accelerating voltage on the Franck-Hertz experiment confirms the quantization of energy levels in atoms in the following ways:\n\n1. The observation of discrete peaks in the current measured at the detector indicates that energy transfer between electrons and mercury atoms occurs in specific, quantized amounts.\n\n2. The spacing between the peaks corresponds to the energy differences between the quantized energy levels of the mercury atoms. This provides experimental evidence for the existence of quantized energy levels in atoms.\n\n3. The experiment also demonstrates the conservation of energy, as the energy lost by the electron in an inelastic collision is equal to the energy gained by the mercury atom in the form of excitation to a higher energy level.\n\nIn summary, the Franck-Hertz experiment and the effect of varying the accelerating voltage provide crucial evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms, supporting the development of quantum mechanics and our understanding of atomic structure."
