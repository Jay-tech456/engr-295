    "message_2": "During the final moments of a collapsing star, the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced increases significantly. This increase in amplitude is due to several factors:\n\n1. As the star collapses, its mass becomes more concentrated, leading to a stronger gravitational field. This increased concentration of mass results in a higher energy output in the form of gravitational waves.\n\n2. The rate of the star's collapse also plays a role in the amplitude of the gravitational waves. As the collapse accelerates, the rate at which the mass distribution changes increases, leading to a higher frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\n3. The final moments of a collapsing star are often characterized by violent events, such as supernova explosions or the formation of a neutron star or black hole. These events involve rapid changes in the mass distribution and can lead to the emission of strong gravitational waves with high amplitudes.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star increases during the final moments of its collapse due to the increased concentration of mass, the acceleration of the collapse, and the violent events associated with the final stages of the star's life."
