    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere:\nL is the contracted length as observed by the Earth-bound observer,\nL0 is the proper length of the spaceship when at rest (100m),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c),\nc is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the factor inside the square root:\n\n1 - v^2 / c^2 = 1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 1 - 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNow, we can calculate the contracted length:\n\nL = 100m * sqrt(0.36) = 100m * 0.6 = 60m\n\nSo, the measured length of the spaceship as observed by an Earth-bound observer is 60 meters."
