    "message_2": "Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is a metastable nuclear isomer of technetium-99, which is widely used in medical imaging due to its favorable properties. The half-life of technetium-99m is approximately 6 hours (6.0058 hours, to be more precise).\n\nThe decay process of Tc-99m involves the emission of gamma radiation, which can be detected by gamma cameras in medical imaging procedures. When Tc-99m decays, it releases a gamma photon with an energy of about 140 keV. This energy level is ideal for medical imaging because it is high enough to penetrate tissues but not too high to cause excessive radiation exposure to the patient or the medical staff.\n\nTc-99m is often used as a radiotracer in nuclear medicine, where it is attached to a specific molecule that targets a particular organ or tissue in the body. Once injected into the patient, the radiotracer accumulates in the targeted area, and the emitted gamma radiation can be detected and used to create an image of the distribution of the radiotracer within the body. This allows physicians to diagnose various medical conditions, such as cancer, heart diseases, and bone disorders, by identifying abnormalities in the distribution of the radiotracer.\n\nIn summary, the half-life of technetium-99m is approximately 6 hours, and its decay process, involving the emission of gamma radiation, makes it a useful tool for detecting medical abnormalities through nuclear medicine imaging techniques."
