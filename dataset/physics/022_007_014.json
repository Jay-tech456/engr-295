    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a dark matter particle passing through a detector without interacting with any of its components, we need to consider several factors, including the cross-section of interaction, the density of the detector material, the thickness of the detector, and the number of target particles in the detector.\n\nLet's denote the following variables:\n\n1. σ: The cross-section of interaction between the dark matter particle and the detector material (in cm²).\n2. ρ: The density of the detector material (in g/cm³).\n3. A: The atomic mass of the detector material (in g/mol).\n4. t: The thickness of the detector (in cm).\n5. N_A: Avogadro's number (approximately 6.022 x 10²³ particles/mol).\n6. v: The velocity of the dark matter particle (in cm/s).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of target particles per unit volume in the detector. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nn = (ρ * N_A) / A\n\nNext, we can calculate the mean free path (λ) of the dark matter particle in the detector material. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before interacting with the detector material. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability (P) of the dark matter particle passing through the detector without interacting with any of its components. This can be done using the following formula:\n\nP = exp(-t/λ)\n\nHere, exp(-t/λ) represents the exponential function e^(-t/λ), where e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).\n\nBy plugging in the values for the cross-section of interaction (σ), the density of the detector material (ρ), the atomic mass of the detector material (A), the thickness of the detector (t), and the velocity of the dark matter particle (v), we can calculate the probability of the dark matter particle passing through the detector without interacting with any of its components."
