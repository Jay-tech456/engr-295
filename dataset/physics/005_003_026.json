Calculate the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by someone on the first spaceship. (Assume that the speed of light is c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by someone on the first spaceship, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth (0.6c), and v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth (0.8c).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv = (0.6c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48c^2 / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nv = (1.4c) / 1.48\n\nv = 0.9459c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by someone on the first spaceship is approximately 0.9459c or 2.8377 x 10^8 m/s."
