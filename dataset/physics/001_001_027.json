    "message_2": "The energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π, where h is the Planck constant), and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe wave function of the particle for each energy level can be described using the Hermite polynomials (H_n) and the Gaussian function. The wave function ψ_n(x) for the nth energy level is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = (1 / (2^n * n! * (α/π)^(1/4))) * H_n(α^(1/2) * x) * e^(-α * x^2 / 2)\n\nwhere α = (m * ω) / ħ, m is the mass of the particle, and x is the position in the one-dimensional space. The Hermite polynomials H_n are a series of orthogonal polynomials that can be generated using the recurrence relation:\n\nH_0(x) = 1\nH_1(x) = 2x\nH_n(x) = 2x * H_(n-1)(x) - 2(n-1) * H_(n-2)(x) for n ≥ 2\n\nThe wave function ψ_n(x) represents the probability amplitude of the particle's position in the one-dimensional space for each energy level. The square of the wave function, |ψ_n(x)|^2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at position x in the one-dimensional space."
