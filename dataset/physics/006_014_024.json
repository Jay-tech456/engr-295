    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of decay within a certain time interval, we can use the exponential decay law. The decay probability P(t) is given by:\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ)\n\nwhere t is the time interval (1.0 nanosecond in this case), τ is the mean lifetime of the excited state (2.0 nanoseconds), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(1.0 ns) = 1 - e^(-1.0 ns / 2.0 ns)\n\nP(1.0 ns) = 1 - e^(-0.5)\n\nP(1.0 ns) ≈ 1 - 0.6065\n\nP(1.0 ns) ≈ 0.3935\n\nSo, the probability that the helium atom will decay in the next 1.0 nanosecond is approximately 39.35%."
