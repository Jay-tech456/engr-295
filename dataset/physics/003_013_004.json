    "message_1": "A current-carrying circular loop of radius 0.1 m has a current of 2 A flowing through it. Calculate the magnitude of magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.2 m from the center of the loop on its axis, assuming that the magnetic permeability of free space is 4 π × 10^-7 T m/A.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of free space, I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop on its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 T m/A\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.2 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T m/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^-7 T m * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.04 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^-9 T m) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^-9 T m) / (2 * 0.125 m³)\n\nB = (8π × 10^-9 T m) / (0.25 m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.005 × 10^-7 T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.2 m from the center of the loop on its axis is approximately 1.005 × 10^-7 T."
