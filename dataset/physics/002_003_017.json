    "message_1": "A gas in a piston cylinder system undergoes a process where it absorbs 1000 joules of heat and releases 500 joules of work. If the initial internal energy of the system was 1500 joules, what is the final internal energy of the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the final internal energy of the system, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (∆U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W).\n\n∆U = Q - W\n\nIn this case, the gas absorbs 1000 joules of heat (Q = 1000 J) and releases 500 joules of work (W = 500 J). So, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n∆U = 1000 J - 500 J = 500 J\n\nNow, we know the initial internal energy of the system (U_initial) is 1500 joules. To find the final internal energy (U_final), we can use the following equation:\n\nU_final = U_initial + ∆U\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nU_final = 1500 J + 500 J = 2000 J\n\nSo, the final internal energy of the system is 2000 joules."
