    "message_2": "The average energy of cosmic rays striking the Earth's atmosphere is about 1-2 billion electron volts (1-2 GeV) per nucleon. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. They constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere, where they interact with the atmospheric molecules and create secondary particles, such as muons, neutrons, and other subatomic particles.\n\nThe risk of cancer and other health effects for astronauts on long-duration space missions is significantly higher than for people on Earth due to the increased exposure to cosmic rays and other forms of ionizing radiation. The Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field provide a natural shielding against most cosmic rays, but astronauts in space, especially those traveling beyond low Earth orbit, do not have this protection.\n\nCosmic rays can penetrate spacecraft walls and human tissue, causing damage to cells and DNA. This damage can lead to an increased risk of cancer, cataracts, and other health issues. The risk of cancer for astronauts is estimated to be about 3% higher for every year spent in space.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, spacecraft designers incorporate radiation shielding into the spacecraft's structure, and mission planners try to minimize the time astronauts spend in regions with high radiation levels, such as the Earth's radiation belts and the outer solar system. Additionally, research is ongoing to develop new materials and technologies to further protect astronauts from cosmic rays and other forms of ionizing radiation during long-duration space missions."
