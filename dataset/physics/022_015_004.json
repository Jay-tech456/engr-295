    "message_1": "What is the role of axions in the composition of dark matter? How do axions interact with other particles in the universe and how do scientists detect them? What experimental evidence supports the possibility of axions being a major component of dark matter?",
    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is related to the violation of the combined charge conjugation and parity symmetries in strong interactions. Later, it was realized that axions could also be a candidate for dark matter, an elusive form of matter that makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe but does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes.\n\nThe role of axions in the composition of dark matter is that they could account for a significant fraction of the dark matter in the universe. Axions are very light particles with a small mass, and they are expected to be produced in large quantities during the early stages of the universe. Due to their weak interactions with other particles, they would have survived until today, contributing to the overall mass of dark matter.\n\nAxions interact very weakly with other particles in the universe, primarily through their coupling to photons and other standard model particles. This interaction is mediated by the axion-photon coupling constant, which determines the strength of the interaction between axions and photons. The coupling is extremely weak, making it challenging to detect axions experimentally.\n\nScientists attempt to detect axions through several experimental techniques. One of the most promising methods is the use of resonant cavities in the presence of strong magnetic fields. In these experiments, axions passing through the magnetic field can convert into photons, which can then be detected. Another approach is to search for the effects of axions on the properties of astrophysical objects, such as stars and galaxies. For example, axions could affect the cooling rates of stars or the rotation curves of galaxies.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the possibility of axions being a major component of dark matter is still indirect and inconclusive. There have been some hints of axion-like particles in astrophysical observations, such as the anomalous cooling of white dwarf stars and the observed transparency of the universe to high-energy gamma rays. However, these observations can also be explained by other phenomena, and more definitive evidence is needed to confirm the existence of axions and their role in dark matter.\n\nSeveral experiments are currently underway to search for axions, such as the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). These experiments aim to provide more direct evidence for the existence of axions and their contribution to dark matter. If axions are discovered, it would not only solve the strong CP problem but also provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of dark matter and the composition of the universe."
