    "message_2": "To estimate the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. For a collapsing star, the primary source of gravitational waves is the rapid change in its quadrupole moment during the collapse.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the formula:\n\nh ≈ (G/c^4) * (dE/dt) / r\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, dE/dt is the rate of energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nFor a collapsing star with a mass of 10 solar masses (M = 10 * M_sun), the energy loss rate can be estimated as:\n\ndE/dt ≈ (G/c^5) * (M^2 * R^2 * ω^6)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the star and ω is the angular frequency of the collapse.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the angular frequency by:\n\nf = ω / (2 * π)\n\nFor a typical core-collapse supernova, the collapse time is on the order of milliseconds, and the angular frequency is ω ≈ 10^4 rad/s. The radius of the collapsing core can be estimated as R ≈ 10^4 km.\n\nUsing these values, we can estimate the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nh ≈ (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 / (3 * 10^8 m/s)^4) * (10 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^2 * (10^4 * 10^3 m)^2 * (10^4 rad/s)^6 / (1 * 10^6 * 3.086 * 10^19 m)\nh ≈ 10^-21\n\nf ≈ 10^4 rad/s / (2 * π) ≈ 1.6 * 10^3 Hz\n\nSo, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves is on the order of 10^-21, and the frequency is around 1.6 kHz.\n\nIf the mass of the star was doubled (M = 20 * M_sun), the energy loss rate would increase, and the amplitude of the gravitational waves would also increase. The new amplitude can be estimated as:\n\nh' ≈ (G/c^4) * (dE'/dt) / r\n\nwhere dE'/dt ≈ (G/c^5) * (M'^2 * R^2 * ω^6) and M' = 20 * M_sun.\n\nUsing the same values for R, ω, and r, we find:\n\nh' ≈ 10^-20\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves would not change significantly, as it is primarily determined by the angular frequency of the collapse, which is not directly dependent on the mass of the star.\n\nIn conclusion, if the mass of the star was doubled, the amplitude of the gravitational waves would increase by a factor of 2, while the frequency would remain roughly the same."
