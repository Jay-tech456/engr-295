    "message_1": "A converging lens with a focal length of 15 cm is used to form an image of an object. If the object is placed 40 cm from the lens, what is the magnification of the image formed? Use the Lensmaker's Equation to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's Equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (1/do) + (1/di)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 15 cm) and the object distance (do = 40 cm). We need to find the image distance (di) first.\n\n1/15 = (1/40) + (1/di)\n\nTo solve for di, we can first subtract (1/40) from both sides:\n\n1/15 - 1/40 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(40 - 15) / (15 * 40) = 1/di\n25 / 600 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to find di:\n\ndi = 600 / 25\ndi = 24 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nM = -24 / 40\nM = -0.6\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is -0.6, which means the image is inverted (due to the negative sign) and 0.6 times smaller than the object."
