    "message_1": "What is the observed frequency of light emitted from a moving source with a velocity of 0.8c as measured by an observer at rest? The emitted frequency is 500 THz.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for light. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In the case of light, the formula is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * ( (c + v_relative) / (c - v_relative) )^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the observed frequency,\nf_source is the source frequency,\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s),\nv_relative is the relative velocity between the source and the observer (positive if the source is moving away, negative if it's moving towards the observer).\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nf_source = 500 THz = 500 x 10^12 Hz,\nv_relative = 0.8c (since the source is moving towards the observer, the velocity is negative).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = (500 x 10^12 Hz) * ( (3.0 x 10^8 m/s + (-0.8)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s)) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s - (-0.8)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s)) )^(1/2)\n\nf_observed = (500 x 10^12 Hz) * ( (1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8) )^(1/2)\n\nf_observed = (500 x 10^12 Hz) * ( (0.2) / (1.8) )^(1/2)\n\nf_observed ≈ (500 x 10^12 Hz) * (0.1111)^(1/2)\n\nf_observed ≈ (500 x 10^12 Hz) * 0.3333\n\nf_observed ≈ 166.67 x 10^12 Hz\n\nThe observed frequency of light emitted from the moving source is approximately 166.67 THz."
