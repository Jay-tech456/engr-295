    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole and is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole (in this case, the mass of the Sun, which is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg), and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.954 x 10^3 m\n\nFor an object to orbit a black hole without falling into the event horizon, it must be at a distance greater than the Schwarzschild radius. The minimum stable orbit around a non-rotating black hole is called the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and is located at a radius equal to 3 times the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nISCO radius = 3 * Rs\nISCO radius ≈ 3 * 2.954 x 10^3 m\nISCO radius ≈ 8.862 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the smallest distance from the center of a non-rotating black hole with a mass equal to that of the Sun that an object can orbit without falling into the event horizon is approximately 8,862 meters."
