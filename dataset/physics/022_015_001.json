    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are also considered as a possible candidate for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. Detecting and measuring axions is a challenging task due to their extremely weak interaction with ordinary matter. However, several experimental approaches have been proposed and are being pursued to detect axions.\n\n1. Axion haloscopes: The most well-known experiment in this category is the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX). The basic idea is to use a strong magnetic field to convert axions into detectable photons. The experiment consists of a high-Q (quality factor) microwave cavity placed inside a strong magnetic field. If axions are present, they can convert into photons inside the cavity, and the resulting signal can be detected and measured. The experiment is sensitive to the mass and coupling strength of axions, which are the key properties to look for.\n\n2. Axion helioscopes: These experiments aim to detect axions produced in the sun. The most famous example is the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). It uses a strong magnetic field to convert solar axions into X-ray photons, which can then be detected by X-ray detectors. This method is sensitive to the axion-photon coupling constant, which is another important property of axions.\n\n3. Light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments: In these experiments, a laser beam is shone onto a wall, and a detector is placed on the other side to look for any photons that might have passed through the wall. The idea is that photons can convert into axions in the presence of a strong magnetic field, pass through the wall, and then convert back into photons on the other side. This method is sensitive to the axion-photon coupling constant as well.\n\n4. Astrophysical and cosmological observations: Indirect evidence for axions can be obtained from astrophysical and cosmological observations. For example, axions can affect the cooling rates of stars, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. By comparing these observations with theoretical predictions, constraints on the properties of axions can be obtained.\n\nThe expected properties of axions that we should look for include:\n\n1. Mass: Axions are expected to have a very small mass, typically in the range of micro-electron volts (ÂµeV) to milli-electron volts (meV). The exact mass depends on the underlying theoretical model.\n\n2. Coupling constants: Axions interact very weakly with ordinary matter, and their coupling constants to photons, electrons, and nucleons are expected to be extremely small.\n\n3. Dark matter abundance: If axions make up a significant fraction of dark matter, their abundance should be consistent with the observed dark matter density in the universe.\n\nIn summary, detecting and measuring axions is a challenging task due to their weak interactions with ordinary matter. Several experimental approaches, such as axion haloscopes, axion helioscopes, and LSW experiments, are being pursued to detect axions and measure their properties. The key properties to look for include their mass, coupling constants, and dark matter abundance."
