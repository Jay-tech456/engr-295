    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire has sides of length 0.2 m and 0.3 m. It carries a current of 3 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the rectangular loop, the magnetic field contributions from the opposite sides will cancel each other out. Therefore, we only need to consider the magnetic field produced by the two longer sides (0.3 m) at the center of the loop.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor the rectangular loop, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law along the two longer sides (0.3 m) to find the total magnetic field at the center. Let's consider one of the longer sides. The position vector r has a magnitude of half the shorter side (0.1 m), and the angle between the differential length vector dl and r is 90 degrees. Therefore, the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nThe magnetic field produced by one longer side at the center is:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * ∫dl * r) / r³\n\nSince the current and the distance r are constant along the side, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * ∫dl\n\nNow, we integrate dl along the length of the side (0.3 m):\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * L\n\nwhere L is the length of the longer side (0.3 m).\n\nSince there are two longer sides, the total magnetic field at the center is twice the magnetic field produced by one side:\n\nB_total = 2 * B_side = 2 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * L\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB_total = 2 * (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (3 A * 0.1 m) / (0.1 m)³ * 0.3 m\n\nB_total = 2 * (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.3 A*m) / (0.001 m²)\n\nB_total ≈ 6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is approximately 6 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
