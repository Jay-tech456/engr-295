    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy of the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nWhere ΔS is the change in entropy, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven the initial volume (Vi = 0.05 m³), the initial temperature (T = 300 K), and the external pressure (P = 1.5 bar = 150000 Pa), we can solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nn = (150000 Pa)(0.05 m³) / (8.314 J/mol·K)(300 K)\n\nn ≈ 1.204 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nΔS = (1.204 mol)(8.314 J/mol·K) * ln(0.10 m³ / 0.05 m³)\n\nΔS ≈ (1.204 mol)(8.314 J/mol·K) * ln(2)\n\nΔS ≈ 10.00 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 10.00 J/K."
