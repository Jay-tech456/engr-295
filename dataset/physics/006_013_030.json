    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of finding an electron outside the nucleus of a hydrogen atom due to quantum tunneling, we need to consider the wave function of the electron in the ground state (n=1) and the potential barrier created by the nucleus.\n\nThe wave function for the ground state of a hydrogen atom is given by:\n\nψ(r) = (1/√π) * (1/a₀) * e^(-r/a₀)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the nucleus, a₀ is the Bohr radius (approximately 5.29 x 10^(-11) m), and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe potential barrier for the electron is given by the Coulomb potential:\n\nV(r) = -e²/(4πε₀r)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^(-19) C) and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (approximately 8.85 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²).\n\nTo find the probability of the electron tunneling outside the nucleus, we need to integrate the probability density function, which is the square of the wave function, over the region outside the nucleus:\n\nP = ∫[ψ(r)]² dr\n\nHowever, calculating this integral analytically is quite complex due to the exponential and Coulomb potential terms. Instead, we can approximate the probability by considering that the electron is most likely to be found at a distance close to the Bohr radius (a₀) from the nucleus. The probability of finding the electron within a small distance (Δr) around the Bohr radius can be calculated as:\n\nP ≈ [ψ(a₀)]² * Δr\n\nP ≈ [(1/√π) * (1/a₀) * e^(-a₀/a₀)]² * Δr\n\nP ≈ (1/π) * Δr\n\nSince Δr is very small compared to the Bohr radius, the probability of finding the electron outside the nucleus due to quantum tunneling is extremely low. In practice, the probability is so small that it can be considered negligible for most purposes."
