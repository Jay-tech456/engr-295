    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying horizontally at an altitude of 10 km with a velocity of 1500 m/s. Suddenly, the aircraft encounters a shock wave due to a sudden change in pressure. Determine the Mach number of the aircraft before and after the shock wave. Also, calculate the pressure ratio across the shock wave. Assume that the gas is an ideal gas with a specific heat ratio of 1.4.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Mach number before the shock wave, we need to find the speed of sound at the given altitude. The speed of sound in air can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = sqrt(γ * R * T)\n\nwhere a is the speed of sound, γ is the specific heat ratio (1.4 for air), R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAt an altitude of 10 km, the temperature is approximately 223 K. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\na = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 223) ≈ 299.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the Mach number before the shock wave (M1) using the formula:\n\nM1 = V / a\n\nwhere V is the velocity of the aircraft (1500 m/s) and a is the speed of sound (299.5 m/s). So,\n\nM1 = 1500 / 299.5 ≈ 5.01\n\nThe Mach number before the shock wave is approximately 5.01.\n\nTo find the Mach number after the shock wave (M2), we can use the normal shock relations formula:\n\nM2 = sqrt((2 + (γ - 1) * M1^2) / (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1)))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nM2 = sqrt((2 + (1.4 - 1) * 5.01^2) / (2 * 1.4 * 5.01^2 - (1.4 - 1))) ≈ 0.447\n\nThe Mach number after the shock wave is approximately 0.447.\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure ratio across the shock wave (P2/P1) using the formula:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * γ * (M1^2 - 1)) / (γ + 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * 1.4 * (5.01^2 - 1)) / (1.4 + 1) ≈ 36.02\n\nThe pressure ratio across the shock wave is approximately 36.02."
