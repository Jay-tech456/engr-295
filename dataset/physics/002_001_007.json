    "message_1": "A gas undergoes an isothermal expansion from a volume of 8 L to 16 L with a constant external pressure of 2 atm. If the initial temperature of the gas was 300 K, calculate the work done by the gas during the process.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done by the gas, P_ext is the constant external pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial\nΔV = 16 L - 8 L\nΔV = 8 L\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\nW = -(2 atm) * (8 L)\n\nW = -16 L*atm\n\nTo convert the work done to Joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 L*atm = 101.325 J:\n\nW = -16 L*atm * (101.325 J / 1 L*atm)\nW = -1621.2 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is -1621.2 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas (expanding) against the external pressure."
