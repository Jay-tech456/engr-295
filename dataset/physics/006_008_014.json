    "message_2": "The minimum energy of a photon required to eject an electron from the n=1 shell of a hydrogen atom is equal to the binding energy of the electron in that shell. In this case, the binding energy is -13.6 eV. Since the binding energy is negative, we need to provide at least 13.6 eV of energy to the electron to overcome the binding energy and eject it from the atom.\n\nNow, let's calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electron if the energy of the incident photon is 20 eV. According to the photoelectric effect, the kinetic energy (KE) of the ejected electron can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nKE = E_photon - E_binding\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the incident photon (20 eV) and E_binding is the binding energy of the electron in the n=1 shell (13.6 eV).\n\nKE = 20 eV - 13.6 eV = 6.4 eV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is 6.4 eV when the incident photon has an energy of 20 eV."
