    "message_2": "The event horizon of a rotating black hole, described by the Kerr metric, is the boundary in spacetime beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The Kerr metric is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity that describes a rotating black hole. The event horizon of a rotating black hole is given by the following equation:\n\nr_+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and a is the specific angular momentum of the black hole (a = J/M, where J is the angular momentum).\n\nIn contrast, the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, described by the Schwarzschild metric, is given by the following equation:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is another solution to Einstein's field equations that describes a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole.\n\nThe main difference between the event horizons of rotating and non-rotating black holes is their shape and size. For a non-rotating black hole, the event horizon is a perfect sphere with a radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius (r_s). For a rotating black hole, the event horizon is oblate, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to the rotation. The radius of the event horizon also depends on the angular momentum of the black hole, with a smaller radius at the poles and a larger radius at the equator.\n\nAdditionally, rotating black holes have another important feature called the ergosphere, which is a region outside the event horizon where the spacetime is dragged along with the rotation of the black hole. This allows for the extraction of energy from the black hole through a process known as the Penrose process. Non-rotating black holes do not have an ergosphere."
