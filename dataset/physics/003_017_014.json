    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying a current (I) at a distance (r) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), and θ is the angle between the current element and the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field produced by one segment at the center, then multiply the result by 4 since the magnetic field produced by each segment at the center is the same.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is 20 cm, which is equal to 0.2 m. The current flowing through the segment is 3.0 A. The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of the segment is half the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated as:\n\nr = (1/2) * √(0.2² + 0.2²) = 0.1 * √2 = 0.1 * 1.414 = 0.1414 m\n\nSince the current is flowing parallel to the sides of the square, the angle θ between the current element and the position vector from the current element to the center is 45° or π/4 radians.\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field produced by one segment at the center:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\ndB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3.0 A * 0.2 m * sin(π/4)) / (4 * π * (0.1414 m)²)\n\ndB = (2.4 × 10⁻⁶ T * √2) / (2 * 0.01998)\n\ndB = 1.699 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSince there are four segments, the total magnetic field at the center of the square loop is:\n\nB = 4 * dB = 4 * 1.699 × 10⁻⁴ T = 6.796 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square-loop conductor is approximately 6.796 × 10⁻⁴ T (tesla)."
