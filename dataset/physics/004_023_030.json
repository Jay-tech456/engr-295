    "message_2": "According to the theory of General Relativity, the merger of two black holes of different masses will emit gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime. The shape and frequency of these gravitational waves depend on the masses of the black holes, their relative distance, and their orbital parameters.\n\nThe gravitational wave signal from a black hole merger can be divided into three phases: inspiral, merger, and ringdown.\n\n1. Inspiral: In this phase, the two black holes are orbiting each other and gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves, which carry away energy and angular momentum. The waveform in this phase can be described by a series of sinusoids with increasing frequency and amplitude, known as \"chirps.\" The frequency of the gravitational waves is directly related to the orbital frequency of the black holes, and the amplitude depends on the masses and distance to the system. For black holes with different masses, the chirp signal will have a more asymmetric shape, and the frequency will increase more rapidly as the lighter black hole gets dragged along by the heavier one.\n\n2. Merger: This is the phase when the two black holes coalesce into a single, more massive black hole. The gravitational wave signal during this phase is highly nonlinear and complex, as it depends on the intricate dynamics of the merging black holes. The waveform will reach its peak amplitude at this stage, and the frequency will be at its highest, known as the \"quasi-normal mode\" frequency. For black holes with different masses, the merger phase will be more asymmetric, and the peak frequency will be shifted compared to equal-mass mergers.\n\n3. Ringdown: After the merger, the newly formed black hole settles down to a stable state by emitting gravitational waves that carry away any remaining distortions in its shape. The waveform in this phase can be described by a series of damped sinusoids, known as \"quasi-normal modes,\" which are characteristic of the final black hole's mass and spin. The frequency and damping time of these modes depend on the properties of the final black hole. For mergers with different masses, the ringdown frequencies and damping times will be different from those of equal-mass mergers, reflecting the unique mass and spin of the final black hole.\n\nIn summary, the merger of two black holes with different masses will produce gravitational waves with a more asymmetric shape and a more rapidly increasing frequency during the inspiral phase. The merger and ringdown phases will also have distinct frequencies and damping times that depend on the final black hole's mass and spin. These differences in the gravitational wave signal can be used to infer the properties of the merging black holes and test the predictions of General Relativity."
