    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure drop along the length of the pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow:\n\nΔP = (8 * μ * Q * L) / (π * r^4)\n\nwhere ΔP is the pressure drop, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, Q is the volumetric flow rate, L is the length of the pipe, and r is the radius of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to SI units:\n\nViscosity (μ) = 0.05 Pa-s\nDiameter of the pipe (d) = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nRadius of the pipe (r) = d / 2 = 0.01 m\nFlow rate (Q) = 3 L/min = (3/1000) m^3/min = (3/1000)*(1/60) m^3/s = 0.00005 m^3/s\nLength of the pipe (L) = 5 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\nΔP = (8 * 0.05 * 0.00005 * 5) / (π * (0.01)^4)\nΔP = (0.02) / (π * 1e-8)\nΔP ≈ 637619.71 Pa\n\nThe pressure drop along the length of the pipe is approximately 637,619.71 Pa."
