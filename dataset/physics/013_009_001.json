    "message_2": "The maximum mass of a star that can form from a molecular cloud is determined by several factors, including the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in which it is located. One of the key factors is the Jeans mass, which is the critical mass above which a cloud of gas will collapse under its own gravity to form a star.\n\nThe Jeans mass (M_J) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nM_J = (4 * pi * rho * (k * T / (G * mu * m_H))^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\n- rho is the density of the molecular cloud\n- k is the Boltzmann constant\n- T is the temperature of the cloud\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- mu is the mean molecular weight of the gas\n- m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom\n\nThe Jeans mass is directly related to the properties of the interstellar medium, such as its density and temperature. Higher density and lower temperature in the ISM lead to a lower Jeans mass, making it easier for a cloud to collapse and form a star. Conversely, lower density and higher temperature result in a higher Jeans mass, making it more difficult for a cloud to collapse.\n\nHowever, the maximum mass of a star that can form from a molecular cloud is not solely determined by the Jeans mass. Other factors, such as the cloud's angular momentum, magnetic fields, and the presence of nearby stars, can also influence the star formation process.\n\nIn practice, the most massive stars observed in the universe have masses around 100-150 times the mass of the Sun. This upper limit is thought to be due to the intense radiation pressure from the massive star itself, which can halt the accretion of additional mass onto the star.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of a star that can form from a molecular cloud is influenced by the properties of the interstellar medium, such as its density and temperature, as well as other factors like angular momentum and magnetic fields. The Jeans mass provides a useful estimate of the critical mass required for a cloud to collapse and form a star, but the actual maximum mass of a star is likely to be limited by additional factors, such as radiation pressure."
