    "message_2": "To estimate the age of the universe according to the Big Bang theory in relativistic cosmology, we can use the Hubble constant (H0) and the Hubble time formula. The Hubble time is an estimation of the age of the universe based on the rate of expansion. The formula for Hubble time (tH) is:\n\ntH = 1 / H0\n\nThe Hubble constant (H0) is given as 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. To use this value in the formula, we need to convert it to the appropriate units. \n\n1 parsec = 3.0857 × 10^16 meters\n1 megaparsec = 10^6 parsecs\n\nSo, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70 × 10^3 m/s / (3.0857 × 10^22 m)\n\nH0 ≈ 2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hubble time:\n\ntH = 1 / (2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1)\ntH ≈ 4.41 × 10^17 seconds\n\nTo convert this value into years, we can use the following conversion:\n\n1 year ≈ 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds\n\ntH ≈ 4.41 × 10^17 s × (1 year / 3.1536 × 10^7 s)\ntH ≈ 13.98 billion years\n\nConsidering the time dilation effects due to special relativity, the age of the universe would still be approximately the same, as these effects are more significant for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. The expansion of the universe is not fast enough to cause significant time dilation effects on the age estimation.\n\nSo, the estimated age of the universe according to the Big Bang theory in relativistic cosmology, assuming a Hubble constant of 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec, is approximately 13.98 billion years."
