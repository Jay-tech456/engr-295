    "message_2": "In a hydrogen atom, the energy level diagram consists of several energy levels, which are represented by the principal quantum number n. When a hydrogen atom undergoes X-ray absorption, an electron in the innermost shell (n=1) absorbs a high-energy X-ray photon and gets excited to a higher energy level (n>1). This process is called the photoelectric effect. When the electron returns to its original energy level (n=1), it emits an X-ray photon, which is the X-ray emission process.\n\nThe energy levels of a hydrogen atom are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nTo find the difference in energy between the initial and final states, we need to know the initial and final energy levels (n_initial and n_final). For example, if the electron is excited from n=1 to n=3 and then returns to n=1, the energy difference between the initial and final states can be calculated as follows:\n\nE_initial = -13.6 eV / (1^2) = -13.6 eV\nE_final = -13.6 eV / (3^2) = -1.51 eV\n\nEnergy difference = E_final - E_initial = -1.51 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 12.09 eV\n\nIn this example, the energy difference between the initial and final states is 12.09 eV. This value will vary depending on the specific energy levels involved in the X-ray absorption and emission processes."
