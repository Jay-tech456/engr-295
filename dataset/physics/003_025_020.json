    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from a copper wire carrying a current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength around a straight wire, which is given by Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current in the wire (2.5 A), and r is the distance from the wire (0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (10⁻⁶ T·m/A * 2.5 A) / 0.1 m\nB = 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the copper wire is 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla)."
