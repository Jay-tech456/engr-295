    "message_1": "A copper wire with a length of 2.5 meters carries a current of 3.5 Amperes. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 8 cm away from the wire, perpendicular to the current?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 8 cm away from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 3.5 A and r = 0.08 m (converting 8 cm to meters).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.08 m)\nB = (14π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.16 m)\nB = (14/0.16) × 10^(-7) T\nB ≈ 8.75 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 8 cm away from the wire is approximately 8.75 × 10^(-7) T.\n\nNow, to find the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. Point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire) and curl your fingers. Your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, if we assume the current is flowing in the positive x-direction, the magnetic field will be circulating around the wire in a clockwise direction when viewed from above. At the point 8 cm away from the wire, perpendicular to the current, the magnetic field will be pointing in the negative y-direction (assuming a standard Cartesian coordinate system)."
