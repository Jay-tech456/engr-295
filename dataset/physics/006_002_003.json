    "message_2": "The fine structure constant (α) is a fundamental constant in physics that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. Its value is approximately 1/137, but it can be determined more precisely through various experimental methods, including the anomalous Zeeman effect in hydrogen-like ions.\n\nFor hydrogen-like carbon ions (C5+), the electron g-factor can be measured using the anomalous Zeeman effect. The g-factor is related to the fine structure constant, α, through the following equation:\n\ng = 2(1 + α/2π)\n\nBy measuring the g-factor experimentally and solving for α, we can obtain a more precise value for the fine structure constant. Recent experimental results have determined the electron g-factor in hydrogen-like carbon ions with high precision, leading to a value for the fine structure constant of:\n\nα ≈ 1/137.035999\n\nTo six significant figures, the fine structure constant α is approximately 0.00729735."
