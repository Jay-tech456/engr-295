    "message_2": "The tau lepton, also known as the tau particle or τ-lepton, is a negatively charged elementary particle that belongs to the lepton family, along with the electron and muon. It is the heaviest of the three leptons and has a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c², which is about 3477 times heavier than the electron and 16.8 times heavier than the muon. The tau lepton has a charge of -1 elementary charge, similar to the electron and muon.\n\nHere are some key physical properties of the tau lepton and how they differ from the electron and muon:\n\n1. Mass: As mentioned earlier, the tau lepton is significantly heavier than the electron and muon. The electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c², the muon has a mass of about 105.7 MeV/c², and the tau lepton has a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c².\n\n2. Lifetime: The tau lepton has a much shorter lifetime than the electron and muon. The tau lepton's mean lifetime is about 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds, while the muon's mean lifetime is about 2.2 x 10^(-6) seconds. The electron, being a stable particle, does not decay and has an infinite lifetime.\n\n3. Decay modes: Due to its larger mass, the tau lepton can decay into a wider variety of particles compared to the muon. The tau lepton can decay into lighter leptons (electron or muon) and associated neutrinos, or it can decay into hadrons (such as pions) and a tau neutrino. The muon, on the other hand, primarily decays into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The electron does not decay, as it is the lightest charged lepton.\n\n4. Interactions: Like the electron and muon, the tau lepton interacts through the electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces. However, due to its larger mass, the tau lepton can participate in some weak interactions that are not accessible to the lighter leptons.\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton is the heaviest and least stable of the three leptons, with a mass much greater than that of the electron and muon. It has a shorter lifetime and can decay into a wider variety of particles compared to the muon. Like the electron and muon, it interacts through the electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces."
