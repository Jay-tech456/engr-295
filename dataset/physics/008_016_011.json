    "message_2": "There are several experimental observations and phenomena that suggest the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model in particle physics. Some of these evidences are:\n\n1. Neutrino Oscillations: The discovery of neutrino oscillations, which implies that neutrinos have mass, is a clear indication of physics beyond the Standard Model, as the model originally assumed neutrinos to be massless. This phenomenon has been observed in several experiments, such as Super-Kamiokande, SNO, and KamLAND. The existence of neutrino masses and mixing angles can be incorporated into the Standard Model through the addition of new particles and interactions, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe.\n\n2. Dark Matter: Astrophysical and cosmological observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background, provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, a non-luminous form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. The Standard Model does not include a suitable dark matter candidate, which suggests the need for new particles and interactions to explain this phenomenon. Theoretical models like supersymmetry and axions have been proposed to explain dark matter, and ongoing experiments are searching for direct and indirect evidence of these new particles.\n\n3. Dark Energy: Observations of the accelerated expansion of the universe, as evidenced by the redshift of distant supernovae, suggest the existence of dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that makes up about 68% of the universe's mass-energy content. The nature of dark energy is not explained by the Standard Model, and its inclusion requires an extension of the model or the development of new theoretical frameworks, such as modifications to general relativity or the introduction of new scalar fields.\n\n4. Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry: The observed predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe is not fully explained by the Standard Model. The model's CP violation, which allows for a slight asymmetry between matter and antimatter, is not sufficient to account for the observed imbalance. This suggests the existence of new sources of CP violation or other mechanisms beyond the Standard Model that can generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry.\n\n5. Hierarchy Problem: The large discrepancy between the electroweak scale (associated with the Higgs boson mass) and the Planck scale (associated with gravity) is known as the hierarchy problem. The Standard Model does not provide a natural explanation for this hierarchy, which has led to the development of new theoretical frameworks, such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs models, to address this issue.\n\nThese experimental evidences contribute to the theoretical understanding of new physics by motivating the development of new models and theories that can explain these phenomena. These new models often predict the existence of new particles and interactions, which can be tested in high-energy experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The ongoing interplay between experimental observations and theoretical developments will continue to shape our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe and the possible existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model."
