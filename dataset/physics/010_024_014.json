    "message_2": "The maximum initial mass of a star that can evolve into a white dwarf is approximately 8-10 solar masses (where one solar mass is equal to the mass of our Sun). Stars with initial masses below this threshold will eventually evolve into white dwarfs, while stars with higher initial masses will undergo supernova explosions and form neutron stars or black holes.\n\nFor a star to evolve into a white dwarf, it must go through the following stages:\n\n1. Main Sequence: The star spends most of its life in this stage, fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. The outward pressure from nuclear fusion balances the inward force of gravity, maintaining the star's stability.\n\n2. Red Giant: As the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers of the star to expand. The star becomes a red giant, with hydrogen fusion now occurring in a shell around the core.\n\n3. Helium Fusion: When the core temperature is high enough, helium fusion begins, producing carbon and oxygen. This process is relatively short-lived compared to the main sequence stage.\n\n4. Planetary Nebula: The outer layers of the star are ejected, forming a planetary nebula. The core, now composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, continues to contract under gravity.\n\n5. White Dwarf: The core eventually becomes a white dwarf, a dense, Earth-sized object supported by electron degeneracy pressure. It no longer undergoes nuclear fusion and will gradually cool over time, eventually becoming a black dwarf (a theoretical stage that has not yet been observed due to the extremely long cooling timescales).\n\nIn summary, a star with an initial mass of 8-10 solar masses or less can evolve into a white dwarf, going through the main sequence, red giant, helium fusion, planetary nebula, and white dwarf stages."
