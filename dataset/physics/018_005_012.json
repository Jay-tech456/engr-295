    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino\n- θ is the mixing angle between the two types of neutrinos (0.1 radians)\n- Δm² is the difference in the squares of the masses of the two neutrino types (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (500 km)\n- E is the neutrino energy (1 GeV)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value for Δm². The current experimental data provides us with two mass squared differences: Δm²21 (the difference between m²2 and m²1) and Δm²31 (the difference between m²3 and m²1). To proceed with the calculation, we need to know which mass squared difference is relevant for the muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillation.\n\nAssuming we have the appropriate Δm² value, we can plug in the given values into the formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.1) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * 500000 / 1000000)\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(0.2) * sin²(0.635 * Δm²)\n\nTo find the probability, we need the value of Δm². Once we have that value, we can plug it into the equation and calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino over a distance of 500 km with a neutrino energy of 1 GeV and a mixing angle of 0.1 radians."
