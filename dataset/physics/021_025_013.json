    "message_2": "The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a result of black hole mergers in the early universe is an interesting topic in theoretical astrophysics. However, it is important to note that the formation of PBHs and the mergers of black holes are two separate processes.\n\nPrimordial black holes are hypothesized to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, due to the collapse of high-density regions in the cosmic plasma. The likelihood of their formation depends on the initial conditions of the universe, such as the density fluctuations and the expansion rate. The exact probability of PBH formation is still uncertain and is an active area of research.\n\nOn the other hand, black hole mergers are events where two black holes come close enough to each other and eventually merge due to the emission of gravitational waves. These mergers are observed in the present-day universe, and their frequency depends on the initial distribution of black holes, their masses, and their binary formation mechanisms.\n\nNow, regarding the possibility of PBH formation as a result of black hole mergers in the early universe, it is important to consider the following points:\n\n1. The early universe was dominated by radiation, and the density of matter was much lower than it is today. This means that the probability of black holes coming close enough to merge was also lower.\n\n2. The black holes that could have existed in the early universe would have been much smaller than the ones we observe today. This is because the mass of a black hole is directly related to the density of the surrounding matter, which was lower in the early universe.\n\n3. Even if black hole mergers occurred in the early universe, the resulting black hole would not necessarily be classified as a primordial black hole. A primordial black hole is defined by its formation mechanism (i.e., the collapse of high-density regions in the cosmic plasma), not by its age or the epoch in which it formed.\n\nIn summary, while black hole mergers are an interesting phenomenon, their role in the formation of primordial black holes in the early universe is likely minimal. The formation of PBHs is more closely related to the initial conditions of the universe and the density fluctuations in the cosmic plasma. The properties of the parent black holes, such as their masses and spins, would not have a significant impact on the likelihood of PBH formation as a result of black hole mergers."
