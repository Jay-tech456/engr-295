    "message_2": "The decay of a muon to an electron and a photon is a process that would violate lepton flavor conservation. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, lepton flavor is conserved, meaning that such a decay should not occur. However, there are some extensions to the Standard Model that predict a small probability for this decay to happen.\n\nThe probability of a muon decaying to an electron and a photon is extremely small and has not been observed experimentally yet. The current experimental upper limit on the branching ratio (the probability of this decay happening) is about 10^(-13), which means that if this decay occurs, it happens less than once in every 10^13 muon decays.\n\nIt is important to note that the probability of this decay happening depends on the specific experimental setup and the sensitivity of the detectors used. As technology advances and more sensitive experiments are conducted, the upper limit on the branching ratio may be further constrained or, if lepton flavor violation is discovered, a more precise probability for this decay can be determined."
