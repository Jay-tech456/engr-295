    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light. It is the point of no return for any object that crosses it. The event horizon is directly related to the mass of the black hole.\n\nThe size of the event horizon can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula, which is given by:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the event horizon for a black hole with a mass equivalent to 10 times that of the sun, we first need to know the mass of the sun, which is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon for a black hole with a mass equivalent to 10 times that of the sun is approximately 29.5 kilometers."
