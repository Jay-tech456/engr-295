    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located a distance 'r' away from the center of a uniformly charged sphere carrying a current 'I', we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, it is important to note that a uniformly charged sphere cannot carry a current in a steady-state situation. Current requires a flow of charge, and in a uniformly charged sphere, there is no net flow of charge. \n\nAssuming you meant a uniformly charged rotating sphere, we can proceed with the following analysis:\n\nLet's consider a uniformly charged rotating sphere with a total charge 'Q' and radius 'R', rotating with an angular velocity 'ω'. The current 'I' can be calculated as the charge passing through a given area per unit time. \n\nFirst, we need to find the surface charge density 'σ' of the sphere:\n\nσ = Q / (4πR^2)\n\nNow, we can find the current 'I' passing through a circular strip of width 'dx' at a distance 'x' from the center of the sphere:\n\nI(x) = σ * 2πx * dx * ω\n\nNext, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field 'dB' produced by this current strip at a point 'P' located a distance 'r' away from the center of the sphere:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I(x) * dx) / (r^2 + x^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate 'dB' over the entire sphere to find the total magnetic field 'B' at point 'P':\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I(x) * dx) / (r^2 + x^2)^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = R\n\nAfter integrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nB = (2/3) * (μ₀ * Q * ω * r) / (4π * R^3)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a point located a distance 'r' away from the center of a uniformly charged rotating sphere carrying a current 'I'."
