    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, do is the object distance (distance between the object and the mirror), and di is the image distance (distance between the image and the mirror).\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 40 cm, we can find the image distance (di) as follows:\n\n1/20 = 1/40 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n1/di = 1/20 - 1/40\n1/di = (2 - 1) / 40\n1/di = 1/40\n\nThus, di = 40 cm. The image is formed 40 cm in front of the mirror.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, di is the image distance, and do is the object distance.\n\nM = -40/40\nM = -1\n\nSince the magnification is -1, the image is the same size as the object but inverted (negative sign indicates inversion)."
