    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted during the collision of neutron stars, we can use the Kepler's third law of planetary motion and the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave frequency.\n\nKepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius (R). The proportionality constant depends on the total mass (M) of the system:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * R^3) / (G * M)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the orbital frequency (f_orbital):\n\nf_orbital = 1 / T = sqrt(G * M / (4 * pi^2 * R^3))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the total mass (3 solar masses) and orbital radius (100 km):\n\nM = 3 * (1.989 * 10^30 kg) = 5.967 * 10^30 kg\nR = 100 * 10^3 m\n\nG = 6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\n\nf_orbital = sqrt((6.674 * 10^-11 * 5.967 * 10^30) / (4 * pi^2 * (100 * 10^3)^3))\nf_orbital ≈ 1327 Hz\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency (due to the quadrupole nature of the radiation):\n\nf_gravitational = 2 * f_orbital ≈ 2654 Hz\n\nThis is the frequency of gravitational waves emitted just before the merger. As the neutron stars spiral inwards and merge, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves will increase. The exact frequency range depends on the details of the merger process, but it is expected to be in the range of a few hundred Hz to a few kHz. In this case, the frequency range would start around 2654 Hz and increase as the merger progresses."
