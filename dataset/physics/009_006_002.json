    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 20cm forms an inverted image that is 3 times the size of the object. What is the distance of the object from the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula for concave mirrors.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = -20 cm (negative because it's a concave mirror)\nMagnification (M) = -3 (negative because the image is inverted)\n\nFirst, let's find the distance of the image (v) from the mirror using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n-3 = -v/u\n\nSince we need to find the distance of the object (u) from the mirror, let's rewrite the equation in terms of u:\n\nu = v/3\n\nNow, let's use the mirror formula to find the relationship between u and v:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/-20 = 1/u + 1/v\n\nSubstitute the expression for u from the magnification formula:\n\n1/-20 = 1/(v/3) + 1/v\n\nSolve for v:\n\n1/-20 = 3/v + 1/v\n-1/20 = 4/v\n\nv = -80 cm (negative because the image is on the same side as the focal point)\n\nNow, we can find the distance of the object (u) from the mirror using the expression we found earlier:\n\nu = v/3\nu = -80/3\nu = -26.67 cm (approximately)\n\nSo, the distance of the object from the mirror is approximately 26.67 cm."
