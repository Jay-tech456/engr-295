    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron in the hydrogen atom transitions from the n = 3 to the n = 2 energy level, we can use the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1² - 1/n2²)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m^(-1)), n1 is the initial energy level (n = 3), and n2 is the final energy level (n = 2).\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/2² - 1/3²)\n1/λ = (1.097 x 10^7 m^(-1)) * (1/4 - 1/9)\n1/λ = (1.097 x 10^7 m^(-1)) * (5/36)\n\nNow, we can solve for λ:\n\nλ = 1 / [(1.097 x 10^7 m^(-1)) * (5/36)]\nλ ≈ 6.564 x 10^(-7) m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron in the hydrogen atom transitions from the n = 3 to the n = 2 energy level is approximately 6.564 x 10^(-7) meters, or 656.4 nm. This wavelength corresponds to the red region of the visible light spectrum."
