    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere:\nθ = angular position of the minimum\nm = order of the minimum (for the first minimum, m = 1)\nλ = wavelength of the light (633 nm)\na = width of the slit (0.05 mm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units to be consistent. We'll convert the wavelength and slit width to meters:\n\nλ = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.05 mm = 0.05 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (0.05 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 0.01266\n\nNow, we can find the angular position θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.01266) ≈ 0.725°\n\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.725°."
