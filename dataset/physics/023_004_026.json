    "message_1": "Problem: \n\nAlice and Bob want to communicate securely using quantum cryptography. Alice sends Bob a sequence of qubits that can be in states $|0 \\rangle$ or $|1 \\rangle$. However, this communication channel is controlled by an eavesdropper, Eve, whom they assume can perform any operation on the qubits. To ensure the security of their communication, they use a protocol called BB84. \n\nIn this protocol, Alice randomly chooses to encode each qubit either in the $|0 \\rangle$, $|1 \\rangle$, $|+ \\rangle$ or $|- \\rangle$ basis (where $|+ \\rangle = (|0 \\rangle + |1 \\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ and $|- \\rangle = (|0 \\rangle - |1 \\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ are the superposition states). Bob receives the sequence of qubits and randomly chooses a basis to measure them. Alice and Bob then discuss the basis they used for each qubit and keep only the qubits measured in the same basis. \n\nThe protocol guarantees security because if Eve measures a qubit in the wrong basis, her operation will disturb the state of the qubit and Alice and Bob will detect this in their discussion. \n\nSuppose Alice wants to send Bob a secret binary string of 8 bits using the above protocol. How many qubits should Alice send to Bob? How many qubits would Eve need to measure in order to learn the entire secret message with a probability of at most 10%?",
    "message_2": "First, let's determine how many qubits Alice should send to Bob. Since Alice and Bob randomly choose their basis for encoding and measuring, they will only have a 50% chance of choosing the same basis for each qubit. To obtain 8 bits of secret information, they will need to send twice as many qubits, so Alice should send 16 qubits to Bob.\n\nNow let's determine how many qubits Eve would need to measure to learn the entire secret message with a probability of at most 10%. When Eve measures a qubit, she has a 50% chance of choosing the correct basis and a 50% chance of choosing the wrong basis. If she chooses the wrong basis, she will disturb the state of the qubit, and Alice and Bob will detect this disturbance.\n\nLet's denote the probability of Eve learning the entire secret message as P(Eve). We want P(Eve) ≤ 0.1 (10%). Since there are 16 qubits, Eve needs to guess the correct basis for all 16 qubits to learn the entire secret message. The probability of guessing the correct basis for one qubit is 0.5, so the probability of guessing the correct basis for all 16 qubits is (0.5)^16.\n\nP(Eve) = (0.5)^16 = 1.52587890625e-5 ≈ 0.0015 (0.15%)\n\nSince P(Eve) is already less than 10%, Eve would need to measure all 16 qubits to have a chance of learning the entire secret message. However, her probability of doing so is still very low (0.15%)."
