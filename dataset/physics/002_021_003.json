    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of water in a closed vessel at a pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 100°C, we can use the steam table data. Steam tables provide us with the properties of water and steam at various temperatures and pressures. For this problem, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ) and the saturation pressure (P_sat) at the given temperature.\n\nFrom the steam table data, at 100°C (373.15 K), the saturation pressure (P_sat) is approximately 1.014 atm (101.4 kPa).\n\nNow, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ). The fugacity coefficient is a dimensionless number that represents the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. For water near its saturation point, we can assume that the fugacity coefficient is close to 1, as the vapor behaves almost like an ideal gas.\n\nSo, φ ≈ 1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity (f) using the following equation:\n\nf = φ * P_sat\n\nf ≈ 1 * 1.014 atm\n\nf ≈ 1.014 atm\n\nTherefore, the fugacity of water in a closed vessel at a pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 100°C is approximately 1.014 atm."
