    "message_1": "What is the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction A(g) + B(g) → C(g), given that the standard free energy changes of formation for A(g), B(g), and C(g) are -50 kJ/mol, -75 kJ/mol, and 100 kJ/mol respectively? (Hint: Use the formula ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and Q is the reaction quotient.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction A(g) + B(g) → C(g), we first need to determine the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction. This can be done using the standard free energy changes of formation for A(g), B(g), and C(g).\n\nΔG° = ΔGf°(C) - [ΔGf°(A) + ΔGf°(B)]\n\nGiven the standard free energy changes of formation for A(g), B(g), and C(g) are -50 kJ/mol, -75 kJ/mol, and 100 kJ/mol respectively:\n\nΔG° = 100 kJ/mol - [(-50 kJ/mol) + (-75 kJ/mol)]\nΔG° = 100 kJ/mol - (-125 kJ/mol)\nΔG° = 225 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need more information to calculate ΔG using the formula ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q). Specifically, we need the temperature (T) and the reaction quotient (Q). The reaction quotient (Q) is calculated using the concentrations of the products and reactants at a specific point in time during the reaction. If we don't have this information, we cannot calculate ΔG using the given formula."
