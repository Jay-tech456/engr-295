    "message_1": "A student is trying to determine the focal length of a thin lens using the thin lens equation. They have measured the object distance to be 20 cm and the image distance to be 30 cm. What is the focal length of the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the focal length of the lens, we can use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance (20 cm), and di is the image distance (30 cm).\n\n1/f = 1/20 + 1/30\n\nTo solve for f, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/f = (3 + 2) / 60\n\n1/f = 5/60\n\nNow, we can find the reciprocal of both sides to solve for f:\n\nf = 60/5\n\nf = 12 cm\n\nThe focal length of the lens is 12 cm."
