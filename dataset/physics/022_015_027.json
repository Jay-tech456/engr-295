    "message_2": "The hypothesis of axion composition of dark matter can be tested in a laboratory setting through several experimental approaches. Axions are hypothetical particles that arise from the Peccei-Quinn theory, which was proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Axions are predicted to be very light, weakly interacting, and abundant enough to potentially account for dark matter in the universe.\n\nHere are some experimental approaches to test the axion hypothesis:\n\n1. Axion haloscopes: These experiments search for axions by looking for their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The most well-known axion haloscope is the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX). It uses a high-Q microwave cavity inside a strong magnetic field to enhance the conversion of axions into photons. The photons are then detected by a low-noise amplifier. A positive detection of photons with the expected properties would support the axion hypothesis, while a null result would set constraints on the axion's properties.\n\n2. Axion helioscopes: These experiments aim to detect axions produced in the sun. The most famous axion helioscope is the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). It uses a strong magnetic field to convert solar axions into X-ray photons, which are then detected by X-ray detectors. A detection of X-ray photons with the expected properties would support the axion hypothesis, while a null result would set constraints on the axion's properties.\n\n3. Light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments: These experiments search for axions by shining a laser through a strong magnetic field and a barrier. If axions exist, some photons should convert into axions, pass through the barrier, and then convert back into photons on the other side. The regenerated photons are then detected. A positive detection would support the axion hypothesis, while a null result would set constraints on the axion's properties.\n\n4. Axion-like particle (ALP) searches: ALPs are hypothetical particles similar to axions but with different properties. Some experiments search for ALPs by looking for their effects on the propagation of light in a magnetic field or by searching for their production in particle collisions. A detection of ALPs could provide indirect evidence for axions, while a null result would set constraints on the properties of ALPs and axions.\n\n5. Astrophysical and cosmological observations: Indirect evidence for axions could come from astrophysical and cosmological observations, such as the observed rotation curves of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background radiation, or the distribution of large-scale structures in the universe. These observations could provide constraints on the properties of axions and their contribution to dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the hypothesis of axion composition of dark matter can be tested in a laboratory setting through various experimental approaches, including axion haloscopes, axion helioscopes, LSW experiments, and ALP searches. Experimental evidence supporting or refuting this theory would come from the detection or non-detection of axions or axion-like particles with the expected properties, as well as from astrophysical and cosmological observations."
