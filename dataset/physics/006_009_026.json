    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength after Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\nΔλ is the change in wavelength\nλ is the initial wavelength\nλ' is the final wavelength\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e is the electron rest mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nθ is the angle of scattering\n\nGiven the initial wavelength λ = 500 nm = 500 x 10^-9 m and the angle of scattering θ = 45 degrees, we can calculate the change in wavelength:\n\nFirst, convert the angle to radians:\nθ = 45 * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, apply the Compton formula:\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/4))\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m * (1 - 0.707)\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m * 0.293\nΔλ ≈ 7.11 x 10^-13 m\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of the photon after undergoing Compton scattering is approximately 7.11 x 10^-13 m or 0.711 pm (picometers)."
