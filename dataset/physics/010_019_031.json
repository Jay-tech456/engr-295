    "message_2": "To calculate the time required for the dye to spread uniformly throughout the container, we can use the diffusion equation:\n\nt = L^2 / (2 * D)\n\nwhere t is the time, L is the characteristic length of the container, and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nFirst, we need to find the characteristic length (L) of the container. Since the container has a volume of 2 liters (2000 cm^3), we can assume it has a cubic shape for simplicity. The length of one side of the cube can be found using the formula:\n\nV = L^3\n\n2000 cm^3 = L^3\n\nL = (2000)^(1/3) ≈ 12.6 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the diffusion equation:\n\nt = (12.6 cm)^2 / (2 * 1.2 x 10^-5 cm^2/s)\n\nt ≈ 158.76 cm^2 / (2.4 x 10^-5 cm^2/s)\n\nt ≈ 6.615 x 10^6 s\n\nt ≈ 1,837.5 hours\n\nSo, it would take approximately 1,837.5 hours for the dye to spread uniformly throughout the container."
