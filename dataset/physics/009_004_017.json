    "message_2": "The critical angle (θc) for a glass-air interface can be calculated using Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of glass (1.50), n2 is the refractive index of air (1.00), and θ2 is the angle of refraction, which is 90° when the light is at the critical angle. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\n1.50 * sin(θc) = 1.00 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n1.50 * sin(θc) = 1.00\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θc):\n\nsin(θc) = 1.00 / 1.50\nsin(θc) = 0.6667\n\nTo find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.6667:\n\nθc = arcsin(0.6667)\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle for a glass-air interface with a refractive index of 1.50 for glass and 1.00 for air is approximately 41.81°."
