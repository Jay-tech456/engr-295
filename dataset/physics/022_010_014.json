    "message_2": "If dark matter did not exist in the universe, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation would appear differently in several ways. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, and influences the distribution of matter and radiation in the early universe. Here are some of the ways the CMB would be different without dark matter:\n\n1. Altered anisotropies: The CMB radiation is not perfectly uniform; it has small temperature fluctuations known as anisotropies. These anisotropies are the result of density fluctuations in the early universe, which later led to the formation of cosmic structures. Dark matter contributes to these density fluctuations, so without dark matter, the pattern of anisotropies in the CMB would be different. The amplitude of the fluctuations would be smaller, and the distribution of the fluctuations across different angular scales would change.\n\n2. Modified acoustic peaks: The anisotropies in the CMB can be analyzed in terms of their power spectrum, which shows the amplitude of the fluctuations as a function of their angular scale. The power spectrum has a series of peaks, known as acoustic peaks, which correspond to different physical processes in the early universe. The positions and heights of these peaks are influenced by the presence of dark matter. Without dark matter, the relative heights of the peaks would change, and the positions of the peaks would shift to smaller angular scales.\n\n3. Altered Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect: The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is a phenomenon where CMB photons gain or lose energy as they pass through the gravitational potential wells of large-scale structures. Dark matter contributes to the formation and evolution of these structures, so without dark matter, the ISW effect would be different. This would lead to changes in the large-scale anisotropies of the CMB.\n\n4. Different polarization patterns: The CMB radiation is also polarized, with a specific pattern of polarization known as E-mode and B-mode polarization. The polarization patterns are influenced by the distribution of matter and radiation in the early universe, including the presence of dark matter. Without dark matter, the polarization patterns of the CMB would be different, with changes in the amplitude and distribution of the E-mode and B-mode signals.\n\nIn summary, if dark matter did not exist in the universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation would appear differently in terms of its anisotropies, acoustic peaks, Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and polarization patterns. These differences would provide important clues about the nature of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of the universe."
