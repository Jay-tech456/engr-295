    "message_2": "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the latest measurements of the Higgs boson properties from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are as follows:\n\n1. Mass: The combined mass measurement from the ATLAS and CMS experiments is approximately 125.1 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared). The precise values from each experiment are:\n   - ATLAS: 124.97 ± 0.24 GeV/c²\n   - CMS: 125.26 ± 0.21 GeV/c²\n\n2. Coupling strengths: The Higgs boson coupling strengths are measured relative to the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics. The latest measurements show that the observed couplings are consistent with the Standard Model predictions within the experimental uncertainties. The coupling strengths to various particles are given as follows:\n   - Coupling to W bosons: 1.01 ± 0.10\n   - Coupling to Z bosons: 0.99 ± 0.10\n   - Coupling to top quarks: 1.00 ± 0.10\n   - Coupling to bottom quarks: 1.00 ± 0.10\n   - Coupling to tau leptons: 1.00 ± 0.10\n\n3. Spin: The Higgs boson is a scalar particle, which means it has a spin of 0. The experimental results from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have confirmed this spin-0 property with a high degree of confidence.\n\nPlease note that these values are subject to change as more data is collected and analyzed by the experiments at the LHC. For the most up-to-date information, it is recommended to consult the official publications and websites of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations."
