    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe focal length (f) of a concave mirror is half of its radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The object distance (u) is given as 30 cm:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator (30):\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n2/30 = 1/v\n\nInvert both sides to find v:\n\nv = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 15 cm from the mirror.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nm = -15 cm / 30 cm = -0.5\n\nSince the magnification is negative, the image is inverted. The absolute value of the magnification (0.5) tells us that the image is half the size of the object.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is 15 cm in front of the mirror, half the size of the object, and inverted."
