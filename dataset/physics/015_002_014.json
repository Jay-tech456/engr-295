    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a neutron star merger, we can use the chirp mass formula. The chirp mass (M_c) is a combination of the masses of the two merging objects (m1 and m2) and is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 = 1.4 solar masses and m2 = 1.2 solar masses. First, we need to convert these masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.9885 × 10^30 kg\n\nm1 = 1.4 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 2.7839 × 10^30 kg\nm2 = 1.2 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 2.3862 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_c = (2.7839 × 10^30 kg * 2.3862 × 10^30 kg)^(3/5) / (2.7839 × 10^30 kg + 2.3862 × 10^30 kg)^(1/5)\nM_c ≈ 2.074 × 10^30 kg\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase of the merger can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * π * M_c)^(5/8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s) and G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)).\n\nf ≈ (3 × 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * π * 2.074 × 10^30 kg)^(5/8)\nf ≈ 919 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the neutron star merger with masses 1.4 solar masses and 1.2 solar masses is approximately 919 Hz. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency may vary depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and the dynamics of the merger."
