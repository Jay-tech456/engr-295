    "message_2": "In order to determine the minimum mass of the photino, we need to consider the energy-mass equivalence principle, which is given by the famous equation:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nGiven that the energy level of the photon is 10 GeV, we can convert this to joules:\n\n1 GeV = 1 x 10^9 eV = 1.602 x 10^-10 J (since 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J)\n\nSo, 10 GeV = 10 x 1.602 x 10^-10 J = 1.602 x 10^-9 J\n\nNow, we can rearrange the energy-mass equivalence equation to find the mass:\n\nm = E / c^2\n\nThe speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nm = (1.602 x 10^-9 J) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nm â‰ˆ 1.78 x 10^-35 kg\n\nTherefore, the minimum mass of the hypothetical supersymmetric partner particle of the photon, the photino, is approximately 1.78 x 10^-35 kg, assuming that the energy level of the photon is 10 GeV."
