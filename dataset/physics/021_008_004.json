    "message_2": "To determine the frequency range of gravitational waves generated by the merger of two supermassive black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass (M) of the binary system.\n2. Determine the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase.\n3. Estimate the frequency range during the merger and ringdown phases.\n\n1. Total mass of the binary system:\n\nGiven that each black hole has a mass of 10^6 solar masses, the total mass (M) of the binary system is:\n\nM = 2 * 10^6 solar masses\n\n2. Characteristic frequency during the inspiral phase:\n\nThe characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (8 * pi * G * M)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2), and M is the total mass of the binary system in kilograms.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total mass from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 2 * 10^6 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^36 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the characteristic frequency:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (8 * pi * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 3.978 x 10^36 kg)\nf ≈ 1.3 x 10^-4 Hz\n\n3. Frequency range during the merger and ringdown phases:\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves increases during the merger phase and reaches its peak during the ringdown phase. The frequency during these phases can be a few times higher than the characteristic frequency during the inspiral phase. Therefore, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves generated by the merger of two supermassive black holes with masses of 10^6 solar masses each can be approximately:\n\nf_range ≈ (1.3 x 10^-4 Hz) to a few times (1.3 x 10^-4 Hz)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual frequency range may vary depending on the specific properties of the black holes and their orbits."
