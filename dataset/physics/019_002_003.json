    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the renormalization procedure is used to account for the effects of virtual particles and eliminate divergences in the calculation of the electron's self-energy. This is done through a series of steps:\n\n1. Identify the divergent terms: In QED, the electron's self-energy is calculated using Feynman diagrams, which represent the interactions between electrons and photons. The self-energy involves loop diagrams, where virtual particles are created and annihilated. These loop diagrams often lead to divergent terms in the calculations.\n\n2. Introduce regularization: To handle these divergences, a regularization method is introduced. One common method is the Pauli-Villars regularization, which involves introducing fictitious particles with large masses to cancel out the divergences. Another popular method is dimensional regularization, which involves analytically continuing the calculations to non-integer dimensions.\n\n3. Renormalize the parameters: The next step is to redefine the parameters of the theory, such as the electron's mass and charge, in terms of \"bare\" parameters and counterterms. The bare parameters are the original parameters of the theory, while the counterterms are introduced to cancel out the divergences. This process is called renormalization.\n\n4. Apply renormalization conditions: To determine the counterterms, renormalization conditions are imposed. These conditions ensure that the physical quantities, such as the electron's mass and charge, remain finite and agree with experimental measurements. In QED, the renormalization conditions are usually chosen so that the electron's self-energy and vertex function are finite at a specific momentum scale, called the renormalization point.\n\n5. Calculate physical quantities: With the renormalized parameters and counterterms, the calculations can now be performed to obtain finite results for physical quantities, such as the electron's self-energy and scattering amplitudes.\n\n6. Remove the regularization: Finally, the regularization method introduced in step 2 is removed, and the results are expressed in terms of the physical parameters.\n\nBy applying the renormalization procedure in QED, the effects of virtual particles are accounted for, and the divergences in the calculation of the electron's self-energy are eliminated. This allows for accurate predictions of physical quantities that agree with experimental measurements."
