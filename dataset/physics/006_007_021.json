    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment, conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, was a groundbreaking experiment that provided evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms. In this experiment, mercury atoms were used, and the minimum accelerating potential required to excite the mercury atoms from their ground state to the first excited state was found to be approximately 4.9 volts.\n\nExperimental Setup:\nThe experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass tube containing a small amount of mercury vapor at low pressure. Inside the tube, there are three electrodes: a heated filament (cathode), a grid (anode), and a collector. The heated filament emits electrons through thermionic emission, and these electrons are accelerated towards the grid by applying a potential difference between the cathode and the grid. The collector is placed beyond the grid, and a small retarding potential is applied between the grid and the collector to measure the current.\n\nTheory:\nWhen the electrons emitted from the cathode gain enough energy from the accelerating potential, they can collide with the mercury atoms and transfer their energy to the atoms, causing the atoms to become excited. The energy required to excite the mercury atoms from their ground state to the first excited state is quantized, meaning it has a specific value.\n\nAs the accelerating potential is increased, the electrons gain more energy, and when the potential reaches the minimum value required to excite the mercury atoms, the electrons lose their energy in the inelastic collisions with the atoms. As a result, fewer electrons reach the collector, causing a drop in the current. This drop in current indicates that the electrons have transferred their energy to the mercury atoms, exciting them to the first excited state.\n\nBy analyzing the current-voltage curve, the minimum accelerating potential required to excite the mercury atoms can be determined. In the case of mercury, the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is approximately 4.9 electron volts (eV). Therefore, the minimum accelerating potential required in the Franck-Hertz experiment for mercury atoms to excite from their ground state to the first excited state is approximately 4.9 volts."
