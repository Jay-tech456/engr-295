    "message_2": "The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) supports the Big Bang theory because it provides strong evidence for a hot, dense early universe that has since cooled and expanded. The CMB is a nearly uniform glow of radiation in all directions, which is consistent with the idea that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been cooling as it expands.\n\nThe CMB can tell us about the early universe because its properties, such as its temperature and frequency distribution, are directly related to the conditions at the time when photons decoupled from matter. This decoupling occurred when the universe was around 380,000 years old, and it allowed photons to travel freely through space, eventually reaching us as the CMB.\n\nTo calculate the temperature of the early universe at the time of photon decoupling, we can use the observed frequency distribution of the CMB. The CMB follows a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which means its frequency distribution can be described by Planck's law:\n\nB(ν, T) = (2hν^3/c^2) * (1/(e^(hν/kT) - 1))\n\nwhere B(ν, T) is the spectral radiance, ν is the frequency, T is the temperature, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and k is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nThe peak frequency of the CMB can be found using Wien's displacement law:\n\nν_max = b * T\n\nwhere b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 3.29 x 10^10 Hz/K).\n\nThe observed peak frequency of the CMB is around 160.2 GHz. Using Wien's displacement law, we can calculate the temperature of the CMB:\n\nT = ν_max / b\nT ≈ 160.2 x 10^9 Hz / (3.29 x 10^10 Hz/K)\nT ≈ 2.73 K\n\nThis is the current temperature of the CMB. However, we want to find the temperature at the time of photon decoupling. Since the universe has expanded and cooled, we need to account for the redshift factor (z):\n\nT_decoupling = T_now * (1 + z)\n\nThe redshift factor at the time of photon decoupling is approximately 1100:\n\nT_decoupling ≈ 2.73 K * (1 + 1100)\nT_decoupling ≈ 2.73 K * 1101\nT_decoupling ≈ 3000 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the early universe at the time of photon decoupling was approximately 3000 K."
