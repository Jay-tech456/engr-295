    "message_2": "The fine-structure constant, denoted by α (alpha), is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles, such as electrons and protons. It is approximately equal to 1/137 and is given by the formula:\n\nα = e²/(4πε₀ħc)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn high-energy physics, the electromagnetic force strength is often represented by the coupling constant, which is related to the fine-structure constant. The coupling constant for the electromagnetic interaction is given by:\n\ng = √(4πα)\n\nAs the energy scale increases, the fine-structure constant and the coupling constant are subject to a phenomenon called \"running,\" which means their values change with the energy scale. This running is caused by the interactions of virtual particles in quantum field theory, leading to a change in the effective charge of the particles involved in the interaction. In the case of the electromagnetic interaction, the fine-structure constant increases with energy, making the electromagnetic force stronger at higher energies.\n\nPrecision measurements of the electromagnetic interaction can indeed help us understand the relationship between the fine-structure constant and the electromagnetic force strength better. By measuring the fine-structure constant and the coupling constant at different energy scales, we can study the running of these constants and gain insights into the behavior of the electromagnetic force at high energies. This can also provide valuable information about the unification of forces in the context of grand unified theories and the possible existence of new particles or interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nIn summary, the fine-structure constant is a key parameter that determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, and precision measurements of this constant can help us better understand the behavior of the electromagnetic force at high energies and its connection to other fundamental forces in nature."
