    "message_2": "The maximum amount of entropy that can be contained within a black hole's event horizon is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. This formula relates the entropy of a black hole (S) to its event horizon area (A), the Planck constant (h), the speed of light (c), the Boltzmann constant (k), and the gravitational constant (G):\n\nS = (k * A * c^3) / (4 * G * h)\n\nThe area of the event horizon (A) is related to the mass of the black hole (M) through the Schwarzschild radius (r_s), which is the radius of the event horizon:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nThe area of the event horizon is given by the surface area of a sphere with radius r_s:\n\nA = 4 * Ï€ * r_s^2\n\nBy substituting the expression for the area in terms of mass into the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, we can find the maximum entropy of a black hole based on its mass.\n\nThis limit corresponds with the laws of thermodynamics in the following ways:\n\n1. First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Conservation): The energy of a black hole is related to its mass through the famous equation E = M * c^2. When a black hole absorbs matter or radiation, its mass increases, and so does its energy, conserving the total energy.\n\n2. Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy Increase): The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula implies that the entropy of a black hole increases as its mass increases. When a black hole absorbs matter or radiation, its entropy increases, which is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics stating that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time.\n\n3. Third Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy at Absolute Zero): The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches zero as its temperature approaches absolute zero. However, black holes have a non-zero temperature, known as the Hawking temperature, which is inversely proportional to their mass. As the mass of a black hole increases, its temperature decreases, but it never reaches absolute zero. Therefore, the entropy of a black hole never reaches zero, which is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics."
