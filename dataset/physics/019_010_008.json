    "message_2": "To calculate the running coupling constant of the strong interaction at an energy scale of 2 GeV using Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the perturbative approach up to the third order in αs, we need to use the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) for the strong coupling constant αs. The RGE for αs is given by:\n\nd(αs)/d(log(μ^2)) = β(αs)\n\nwhere μ is the energy scale, and β(αs) is the beta function. In perturbative QCD, the beta function can be expanded as:\n\nβ(αs) = -b0 * (αs^2) - b1 * (αs^3) - b2 * (αs^4) - ...\n\nwhere b0, b1, and b2 are the coefficients of the beta function. For QCD with three active quark flavors (u, d, and s), the coefficients are:\n\nb0 = (33 - 2 * Nf) / (12 * π) = (33 - 2 * 3) / (12 * π) = 11 / (4 * π)\nb1 = (153 - 19 * Nf) / (24 * π^2) = (153 - 19 * 3) / (24 * π^2) = 102 / (8 * π^2)\nb2 = (2857 - 5033 * Nf / 9 + 325 * Nf^2 / 27) / (128 * π^3) = (2857 - 5033 * 3 / 9 + 325 * 3^2 / 27) / (128 * π^3) ≈ 2857 / (128 * π^3)\n\nNow, we can integrate the RGE from an initial energy scale μ0 with a known coupling constant αs0 to the desired energy scale μ = 2 GeV. Up to the third order in αs, the solution is:\n\nαs(μ) = αs0 / (1 + αs0 * b0 * log(μ^2 / μ0^2) + αs0^2 * (b1 * log(μ^2 / μ0^2) - b0^2 * log^2(μ^2 / μ0^2) / 2) + αs0^3 * (b2 * log(μ^2 / μ0^2) - 5 * b0 * b1 * log^2(μ^2 / μ0^2) / 2 + b0^3 * log^3(μ^2 / μ0^2) / 3))\n\nWe need to know the initial energy scale μ0 and the corresponding coupling constant αs0. A common choice is the Z boson mass scale, μ0 = 91.2 GeV, and the corresponding coupling constant αs0 ≈ 0.118. Now we can plug in the values and calculate αs(2 GeV):\n\nαs(2 GeV) ≈ 0.118 / (1 + 0.118 * 11 / (4 * π) * log((2^2) / (91.2^2)) + (0.118^2) * (102 / (8 * π^2) * log((2^2) / (91.2^2)) - (11 / (4 * π))^2 * log^2((2^2) / (91.2^2)) / 2) + (0.118^3) * (2857 / (128 * π^3) * log((2^2) / (91.2^2)) - 5 * 11 / (4 * π) * 102 / (8 * π^2) * log^2((2^2) / (91.2^2)) / 2 + (11 / (4 * π))^3 * log^3((2^2) / (91.2^2)) / 3))\n\nAfter evaluating the expression, we get:\n\nαs(2 GeV) ≈ 0.317\n\nSo, the running coupling constant of the strong interaction at an energy scale of 2 GeV using Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the perturbative approach up to the third order in αs is approximately 0.317."
