    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the iron oxide, we can use the formula:\n\nχ = M / (μ₀ * H)\n\nwhere M is the magnetization of the material, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), and H is the applied magnetic field.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnetization (M) of the iron oxide. We are given the magnetic moment per unit mass (7 Am²/kg) and the mass of the sample (10 g). We can find the total magnetic moment (m) of the sample by multiplying the magnetic moment per unit mass by the mass of the sample:\n\nm = (7 Am²/kg) * (10 g) * (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.07 Am²\n\nNow, we can find the magnetization (M) by dividing the total magnetic moment (m) by the volume (V) of the sample. To do this, we need to know the density (ρ) of the iron oxide. The density of iron oxide (Fe₃O₄) is approximately 5.2 g/cm³.\n\nWe can find the volume (V) of the sample using the formula:\n\nV = mass / density = (10 g) / (5.2 g/cm³) = 1.923 cm³\n\nNow, we can find the magnetization (M) using the formula:\n\nM = m / V = (0.07 Am²) / (1.923 cm³) = 0.0364 Am²/cm³\n\nSince we need the magnetization in SI units (Am²/m³), we can convert it using the conversion factor:\n\nM = 0.0364 Am²/cm³ * (1 m / 100 cm)³ = 3640 Am²/m³\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic susceptibility (χ) using the formula:\n\nχ = M / (μ₀ * H)\n\nwhere μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A and H = 2 T.\n\nχ = (3640 Am²/m³) / ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 T)) = 3640 / (8π × 10^(-7))\n\nχ ≈ 1.45 × 10^6\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the iron oxide at room temperature (300 K) is approximately 1.45 × 10^6."
