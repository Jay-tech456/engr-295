    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino transforming into an electron neutrino, we use the neutrino oscillation formula. The probability P(νμ → νe) can be expressed as:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\nθ is the mixing angle between the neutrino flavors,\nΔm² is the difference in the squared masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²),\nL is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km),\nE is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV).\n\nFor the T2K experiment, the relevant oscillation parameters are:\nθ ≈ 8.5° (θ ≈ 0.148 radians),\nΔm² ≈ 2.5 x 10⁻³ eV².\n\nGiven the distance L = 732 km, we need the energy E of the neutrino to calculate the probability. The T2K experiment uses a beam of muon neutrinos with an average energy of about 0.6 GeV. Using these values, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.148) * sin²(1.27 * 2.5 x 10⁻³ * 732 / 0.6)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.021 * sin²(3.988)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.021 * 0.151\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.00317\n\nSo, the probability of a muon neutrino transforming into an electron neutrino after traveling a distance of 732 km through the Earth's crust and mantle in the T2K experiment is approximately 0.317% or 3.17 x 10⁻³."
