    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field inside a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns per meter), and I is the current in amperes.\n\nGiven the solenoid has 500 turns per meter (n = 500) and carries a current of 2.5 amperes (I = 2.5), we can calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 500 turns/m * 2.5 A\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-6) T * 500 * 2.5\n\nB ≈ 3.1415 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 3.1415 Tesla."
