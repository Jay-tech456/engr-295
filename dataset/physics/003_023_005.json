    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current-carrying wire, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) due to a long straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (5 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field (in this case, the center of the loop)\n\nHowever, we first need to determine the distance (r) from the wire to the center of the loop. Since the wire is perpendicular to the plane of the circular loop, we can assume that the wire passes through the plane of the loop at some point along its diameter. Let's call the point where the wire intersects the plane of the loop point A, and the center of the loop point O. \n\nSince the radius of the loop is 0.2 m, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance AO (r):\n\nAO² = r² = (2 * 0.2)² - 0.2²\nr² = 0.12\nr = √0.12 ≈ 0.3464 m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.3464 m)\n\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-6) Tm * 5 A) / (0.3464 m)\n\nB ≈ 10^(-5) T / 0.3464\n\nB ≈ 2.88 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current-carrying wire is approximately 2.88 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
