    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at 0.8c relative to Earth carries a clock that measures its own elapsed time. If the spaceship travels for 4 Earth years (as measured by Earth-based clocks), how much time will have elapsed on the spaceship's clock? Use the equation for time dilation in a moving frame of reference to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation equation from the theory of special relativity. The equation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nΔt' is the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock,\nΔt is the time elapsed on Earth's clock (4 years in this case),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c),\nc is the speed of light, and\nsqrt denotes the square root function.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔt' = 4 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = 4 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt' = 4 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nΔt' = 4 * 0.6\n\nΔt' = 2.4 years\n\nSo, 2.4 years will have elapsed on the spaceship's clock after traveling for 4 Earth years at a relative velocity of 0.8c."
