    "message_2": "The most likely sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) detected on Earth are extragalactic in origin, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and starburst galaxies. These astrophysical objects are capable of accelerating charged particles, such as protons and atomic nuclei, to extremely high energies.\n\nWhen these ultra-high-energy cosmic rays enter Earth's atmosphere, they interact with the atmospheric molecules, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. The primary cosmic ray particle collides with an atmospheric nucleus, creating a cascade of secondary particles through a process called an extensive air shower. This shower includes a variety of particles such as pions, kaons, muons, electrons, and photons, which can be detected by ground-based observatories and help researchers study the properties and origins of UHECRs.\n\nThe initial interaction of the UHECR with an atmospheric nucleus is typically a hadronic interaction, where the strong nuclear force plays a significant role. This interaction produces a multitude of secondary particles, which can further interact with other atmospheric nuclei or decay into other particles. The extensive air shower continues to develop until the energy of the particles is low enough that they are either absorbed by the atmosphere or reach the ground."
