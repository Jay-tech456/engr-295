    "message_2": "To calculate the splitting of the spectral lines of a hydrogen atom due to the Zeeman effect, we need to consider the energy difference between the magnetic sublevels of the electron in the presence of a magnetic field. The Zeeman effect is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m_j is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * hbar / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, let's consider the transitions between the ground state (n = 1) and the first excited state (n = 2) of the hydrogen atom. For the ground state, the total angular momentum quantum number is j = 1/2, and for the first excited state, j can be either 1/2 or 3/2.\n\nFor the transition between j = 1/2 and j = 1/2, there is no splitting of the spectral lines, as both states have the same magnetic quantum number m_j = ±1/2.\n\nFor the transition between j = 1/2 and j = 3/2, there are three possible values of m_j for the excited state: -3/2, -1/2, and 1/2. The energy difference for each transition is:\n\nΔE_(-3/2) = μ_B * B * (-3/2 - (-1/2))\nΔE_(-1/2) = μ_B * B * (-1/2 - (-1/2))\nΔE_(1/2) = μ_B * B * (1/2 - (-1/2))\n\nUsing the given magnetic field strength B = 0.1 T, we can calculate the energy differences:\n\nΔE_(-3/2) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.1 T) * (-2)\nΔE_(-1/2) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.1 T) * (0)\nΔE_(1/2) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.1 T) * (2)\n\nΔE_(-3/2) ≈ -1.8548 × 10^(-23) J\nΔE_(-1/2) = 0 J\nΔE_(1/2) ≈ 1.8548 × 10^(-23) J\n\nThe splitting of the spectral lines due to the Zeeman effect for transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 0.1 T is approximately ±1.8548 × 10^(-23) J."
