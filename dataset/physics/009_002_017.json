    "message_1": "A ray of light travels from air to glass at an incident angle of 60 degrees. If the refractive index of glass is 1.5, what is the angle of refraction? Use Snell's Law to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media (air and glass in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nGiven that the angle of incidence (θ1) is 60 degrees and the refractive index of glass (n2) is 1.5, we can find the angle of refraction (θ2) as follows:\n\n1 (refractive index of air) * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60) = 0.866025\n\n0.866025 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.866025 / 1.5\n\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.57735\n\nNow, we can find the angle of refraction (θ2) by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.57735:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.57735)\n\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 35.3 degrees."
