    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is the energy required to remove an electron from the lowest energy level (n=1) to infinity. This is equal to the negative of the ground state energy. For a hydrogen atom, the ionization energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy, Z is the atomic number (Z=1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n=1 for the ground state).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the negative of this value:\n\nIonization energy = 13.6 eV"
