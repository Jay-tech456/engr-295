    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment, conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, provided crucial evidence for the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms, which is a fundamental aspect of the quantum mechanical model of an atom. The experiment involved bombarding mercury atoms with low-energy electrons and measuring the energy loss of these electrons after they interacted with the mercury atoms.\n\nThe theoretical explanation behind the observation of discrete energy levels in the Franck-Hertz experiment is based on the quantization of energy levels in atoms, as proposed by Niels Bohr in his model of the hydrogen atom. According to Bohr's model, electrons in an atom can only occupy specific energy levels, and they can transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting a discrete amount of energy in the form of a photon. This quantization of energy levels is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of electrons and the requirement that they form standing waves around the nucleus, as described by quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the Franck-Hertz experiment, when the bombarding electrons have just the right amount of energy to excite a mercury atom from its ground state to an excited state, they lose this energy and the mercury atom becomes excited. This energy loss corresponds to the energy difference between the two discrete energy levels of the mercury atom. When the mercury atom returns to its ground state, it emits a photon with the same energy as the energy difference between the two levels. This process results in the observation of discrete energy levels, as the energy loss of the bombarding electrons occurs in specific, quantized amounts.\n\nThe Franck-Hertz experiment validates the quantum mechanical model of an atom by providing experimental evidence for the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms. The observation of quantized energy loss in the bombarding electrons and the corresponding emission of photons with specific energies supports the idea that electrons in atoms can only occupy specific energy levels and that transitions between these levels involve the absorption or emission of discrete amounts of energy. This quantization of energy levels is a key feature of the quantum mechanical model of an atom and is fundamentally different from the continuous energy distribution predicted by classical physics."
