    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram and determine the position and nature of the image formed by the mirror, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis of the mirror.\n2. Draw a vertical line to represent the mirror, with the concave side facing left.\n3. Mark the focal point (F) and the center of curvature (C) on the principal axis. Since the focal length is 20 cm, F is 20 cm to the left of the mirror, and C is twice the focal length, so it's 40 cm to the left of the mirror.\n4. Place the object (represented by an arrow) 30 cm to the left of the mirror, along the principal axis.\n5. Draw three rays from the top of the object:\n   a. A parallel ray to the principal axis, which will reflect through the focal point (F).\n   b. A ray passing through the focal point (F), which will reflect parallel to the principal axis.\n   c. A ray passing through the center of curvature (C), which will reflect back along the same path.\n\nNow, let's calculate the position and nature of the image:\n\nUsing the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/30\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 60\n1/v = 5/60\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe image is formed 12 cm to the left of the mirror. Since the image distance (v) is positive, the image is real and inverted.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification:\n\nMagnification (m) = -v/u\nm = -12 / (-30)\nm = 12/30\nm = 2/5\n\nThe magnification of the image is 2/5 or 0.4. Since the magnification is less than 1, the image is diminished (smaller than the object).\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is real, inverted, diminished, and located 12 cm to the left of the mirror. The magnification of the image is 0.4."
