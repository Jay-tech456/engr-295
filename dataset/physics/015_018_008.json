    "message_2": "The strength and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star are affected by the distance between the star and the observer. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as a collapsing star. These waves propagate through spacetime, carrying energy away from the source.\n\n1. Strength (Amplitude) of Gravitational Waves:\n\nThe strength or amplitude of gravitational waves decreases as the distance between the source and the observer increases. This is because the amplitude of the waves is inversely proportional to the distance from the source. Mathematically, the strain amplitude (h) of a gravitational wave is given by:\n\nh ‚àù 1 / r\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, and r is the distance between the source and the observer. As the distance r increases, the strain amplitude h decreases, making the gravitational waves weaker.\n\n2. Frequency of Gravitational Waves:\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves is primarily determined by the dynamics of the source, such as the mass and size of the collapsing star. However, the observed frequency can be affected by the relative motion between the source and the observer, due to the Doppler effect. If the source and the observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency will be higher than the emitted frequency, and if they are moving away from each other, the observed frequency will be lower.\n\nIn summary, the strength of gravitational waves decreases with increasing distance between the collapsing star and the observer, while the frequency of the waves is mainly determined by the source's properties and can be affected by the relative motion between the source and the observer."
