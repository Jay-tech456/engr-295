    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass and energy of a proton accelerated to 0.9c (where c is the speed of light), we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) using the following formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic mass (m') using the following formula:\n\nm' = m₀ * γ\n\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass of the proton, which is approximately 1.6726 × 10^(-27) kg.\n\nm' ≈ (1.6726 × 10^(-27) kg) * 2.294\nm' ≈ 3.836 × 10^(-27) kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the proton is approximately 3.836 × 10^(-27) kg.\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic energy (E) using the following formula:\n\nE = m' * c^2\n\nwhere m' is the relativistic mass and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nE ≈ (3.836 × 10^(-27) kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 1.031 × 10^(-10) J\n\nThe relativistic energy of the proton is approximately 1.031 × 10^(-10) Joules."
