    "message_2": "The internal structure of a star changes over time due to its evolution, which affects its observed characteristics such as luminosity, temperature, and spectral lines. The changes in a star's composition, density, temperature, and pressure play a crucial role in determining its stability and eventual fate as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.\n\n1. Composition: A star is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Over time, nuclear fusion in the core of the star converts hydrogen into helium, and eventually into heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron. This process, called nucleosynthesis, alters the star's composition and affects its stability. As the hydrogen fuel in the core depletes, the star's core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers to expand and cool. This leads to the formation of a red giant or supergiant.\n\n2. Density: The density of a star changes as it evolves. In the early stages, the core is dense, and nuclear fusion occurs at a rapid rate. As the core contracts and heats up, the density increases, and the rate of nuclear fusion accelerates. This increased density can lead to the formation of a degenerate core, where the pressure is supported by electron degeneracy pressure rather than thermal pressure.\n\n3. Temperature: The temperature of a star's core increases as it evolves. In the main sequence phase, the core temperature is sufficient for hydrogen fusion. As the core contracts and heats up, the temperature increases, allowing for helium fusion and the production of heavier elements. This increase in temperature affects the star's luminosity and spectral lines.\n\n4. Pressure: The pressure within a star is a balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward force of radiation and gas pressure. As the star evolves, the balance between these forces changes. In the later stages of a star's life, the core contracts, and the pressure increases, leading to the formation of a degenerate core.\n\nThe eventual fate of a star depends on its mass:\n\n- Low-mass stars (less than ~8 solar masses) will evolve into red giants and eventually shed their outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The core left behind will become a white dwarf, supported by electron degeneracy pressure.\n\n- Intermediate-mass stars (between ~8 and ~20 solar masses) will undergo a supernova explosion after forming an iron core. The core left behind will collapse under gravity and form a neutron star, supported by neutron degeneracy pressure.\n\n- High-mass stars (greater than ~20 solar masses) will also undergo a supernova explosion, but the core left behind will be so massive that not even neutron degeneracy pressure can support it. The core will collapse into a black hole, a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\nIn summary, the internal structure of a star changes over time due to its evolution, affecting its observed characteristics such as luminosity, temperature, and spectral lines. The changes in a star's composition, density, temperature, and pressure play a crucial role in determining its stability and eventual fate as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole."
