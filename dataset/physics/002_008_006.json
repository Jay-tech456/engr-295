    "message_1": "If 500 J of energy is added to 100 g of water at 20°C and the final temperature is 50°C, what is the specific heat capacity of water?",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the energy added (500 J), m is the mass of water (100 g), c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (50°C - 20°C = 30°C).\n\nWe need to solve for c:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nc = 500 J / (100 g × 30°C)\n\nc = 500 J / 3000 g°C\n\nc = 0.1667 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water in this case is approximately 0.1667 J/g°C. However, it's important to note that the widely accepted value for the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C. The discrepancy may be due to experimental errors or inaccuracies in the given data."
