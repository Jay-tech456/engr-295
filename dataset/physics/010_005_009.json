Assuming the object's weight is negligible and only drag force and lift force are acting on it.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum velocity of the spherical object, we can use the drag force equation for a sphere:\n\nFd = 0.5 * Cd * ρ * v² * A\n\nwhere Fd is the drag force, Cd is the drag coefficient, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity, and A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere.\n\nFor a sphere, the drag coefficient Cd is approximately 0.47. The cross-sectional area A can be calculated as:\n\nA = π * (d/2)²\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the sphere.\n\nGiven the diameter d = 0.1 m, we can calculate the cross-sectional area A:\n\nA = π * (0.1/2)²\nA ≈ 0.007854 m²\n\nNow we can rearrange the drag force equation to solve for the velocity v:\n\nv² = (2 * Fd) / (Cd * ρ * A)\n\nGiven the drag force Fd = 5 N, fluid density ρ = 1 kg/m³, and dynamic viscosity μ = 0.02 Ns/m², we can find the maximum velocity:\n\nv² = (2 * 5) / (0.47 * 1 * 0.007854)\nv² ≈ 26.862\n\nv = sqrt(26.862)\nv ≈ 5.18 m/s\n\nThe maximum velocity the spherical object can reach in the fluid is approximately 5.18 m/s."
