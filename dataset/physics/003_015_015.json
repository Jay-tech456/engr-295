    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side and then multiply by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nConsider one side of the square loop. Let's call the side length L and the current I. The distance from the midpoint of the side to the center of the square is L/2. The angle between the position vector r and the current element dl is 90 degrees.\n\nFor a straight wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance R from the midpoint of the wire is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * L) / (4π * R)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for our problem:\n\nL = 0.2 m\nI = 2 A\nR = L/2 = 0.1 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A\n\ndB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A * 0.2 m) / (4π * 0.1 m)\ndB = (2 × 10⁻⁷ Tm²)\n\nSince there are four sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * dB\nB_total = 4 * (2 × 10⁻⁷ Tm²)\nB_total = 8 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop due to the current is 8 × 10⁻⁷ T."
