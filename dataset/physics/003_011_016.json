    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a disc carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a disc of radius 'a' and thickness 't', we can consider a small current-carrying ring of radius 'r' and thickness 'dr' within the disc. The current density J (current per unit area) is given by:\n\nJ = I / (πa²)\n\nThe current in the small ring dI is given by:\n\ndI = J * 2πr * dr\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field dB at the point on the axis of the disc due to this small current-carrying ring. The position vector r from the ring to the point on the axis is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(z² + r²)\n\nThe angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl × r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r) / r^3\n\nIntegrating over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = a) to find the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(0 to a) (J * 2πr * dr * dl * r) / r^3\n\nSince the thickness 't' is very small compared to the radius 'a', we can assume that the magnetic field is approximately constant over the thickness. Therefore, we can integrate over the thickness as well:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(0 to a) (J * 2πr * dr * t * r) / r^3\n\nSimplifying and integrating:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * t) / (2 * a²) * ∫(0 to a) (r * dr) / (z² + r²)^(3/2)\n\nLet's use the substitution method to solve the integral:\n\nLet x = r / z, then dx = dr / z\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * t) / (2 * a²) * ∫(0 to a/z) (x * dx) / (1 + x²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * t) / (2 * a²) * [ -1 / sqrt(1 + x²) ] (from 0 to a/z)\n\nEvaluating the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * t) / (2 * a²) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (a/z)²) - 1)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a disc of radius 'a' carrying a current 'I', with a thickness 't', and the point is at a distance 'z' from the center of the disc."
