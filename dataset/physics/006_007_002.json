    "message_1": "What is the minimum acceleration voltage required for mercury vapor in a Franck-Hertz tube to produce the first excitation of the mercury atom from its ground state to the first excited state, given the ionization energy of mercury is 10.4 eV and the energy required for the first excitation of the mercury atom is 4.9 eV?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum acceleration voltage required for the first excitation of the mercury atom, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = eV\n\nwhere E is the energy required for the first excitation (4.9 eV), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), and V is the acceleration voltage.\n\nWe need to solve for V:\n\nV = E / e\n\nV = (4.9 eV) / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C/eV)\n\nV ≈ 3.06 × 10^(-19) C\n\nSince 1 V = 1 J/C, we can convert the result to volts:\n\nV ≈ 3.06 × 10^(-19) J / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C)\n\nV ≈ 1.91 V\n\nTherefore, the minimum acceleration voltage required for the first excitation of the mercury atom in a Franck-Hertz tube is approximately 1.91 volts."
