    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a theoretical form of radiation that is predicted to be emitted by black holes. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who first proposed the idea in 1974. This radiation is a consequence of the quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.\n\nThe concept of Hawking radiation arises from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In the vacuum of space, particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly being created and annihilated. Near the event horizon of a black hole, one of these particles can be captured by the black hole's gravity, while the other escapes. This escaping particle is what we observe as Hawking radiation.\n\nAs a result of this process, the black hole loses mass over time, which is known as black hole evaporation. The rate of evaporation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that smaller black holes evaporate faster than larger ones. In fact, for very large black holes, the rate of evaporation is so slow that it is negligible compared to the age of the universe.\n\nHawking radiation has a thermal spectrum, meaning that it has a characteristic temperature. The temperature of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, so smaller black holes emit hotter radiation. This temperature is known as the Hawking temperature.\n\nAlthough Hawking radiation has not been directly observed, its existence is widely accepted by physicists, as it resolves several theoretical problems related to black holes. Detecting Hawking radiation is challenging due to its extremely low intensity, but future experiments and observations may provide more evidence for its existence."
