    "message_2": "To find the work done by the gas during the adiabatic process, we can use the following formula for adiabatic processes:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index.\n\nFirst, we need to find the final pressure P2. We can use the adiabatic process equation:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nRearranging to find P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP2 = 200 kPa * (0.05 m^3 / 0.01 m^3)^1.4\nP2 ≈ 200 kPa * (5)^1.4\nP2 ≈ 200 kPa * 11.1803\nP2 ≈ 2236.06 kPa\n\nNow we can find the work done:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\nW = (200 kPa * 0.05 m^3 - 2236.06 kPa * 0.01 m^3) / (1.4 - 1)\nW = (10 kJ - 22.3606 kJ) / 0.4\nW ≈ -12.3606 kJ / 0.4\nW ≈ -30.9015 kJ\n\nThe work done by the gas during the adiabatic compression is approximately -30.9 kJ. The negative sign indicates that the work is done on the gas (compression) rather than by the gas (expansion)."
