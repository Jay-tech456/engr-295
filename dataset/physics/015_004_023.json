    "message_2": "To estimate the total energy emitted in gravitational waves during a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * R) / c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the total mass of the ejected material, R is the distance from the source, and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values into SI units. The distance (10 kpc) can be converted to meters using the following conversions:\n\n1 kpc = 3.086 x 10^19 m\n\n10 kpc = 10 * 3.086 x 10^19 m = 3.086 x 10^20 m\n\nThe total mass of the ejected material (2 M☉) can be converted to kilograms using the following conversion:\n\n1 M☉ = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\n2 M☉ = 2 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^30 kg)^2 * 3.086 x 10^20 m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nE ≈ 1.96 x 10^46 J\n\nSo, the estimated total energy emitted in gravitational waves during a supernova explosion is approximately 1.96 x 10^46 Joules. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and the actual energy emitted in gravitational waves can vary depending on the specific properties of the supernova."
