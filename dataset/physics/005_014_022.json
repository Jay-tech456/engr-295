    "message_2": "In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an electron antineutrino. The energy released in this process is shared between the electron and the electron antineutrino. The maximum kinetic energy of the electron occurs when the electron antineutrino carries away negligible energy.\n\nThe energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value, can be calculated as the difference in mass between the initial and final particles, multiplied by the speed of light squared (c²). The masses of the neutron, proton, and electron are given in atomic mass units (u). We first need to convert these masses to kilograms.\n\n1 atomic mass unit (u) = 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nMass of neutron (m_n) = 1.008665 u = 1.008665 × 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\nMass of proton (m_p) = 1.007276 u = 1.007276 × 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\nMass of electron (m_e) = 0.00054858 u = 0.00054858 × 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Q-value:\n\nQ = (m_n - m_p - m_e) × c²\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s.\n\nQ = [(1.008665 - 1.007276 - 0.00054858) × 1.66053906660 × 10⁻²⁷ kg] × (3 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nQ ≈ 1.293 × 10⁻¹³ J\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of the electron is equal to the Q-value, as we assumed the electron antineutrino carries away negligible energy. Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the electron emitted in the beta decay of a neutron is approximately 1.293 × 10⁻¹³ J."
