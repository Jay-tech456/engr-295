    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at two different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe know that the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg) is 100°C or 373.15 K. We want to find the boiling point of water when the atmospheric pressure is 800 mm Hg. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for the new boiling point (T2).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given enthalpy of vaporization from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug in the known values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nln(800/760) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/T2 - 1/373.15 K)\n\n0.051293 = -4893.32 * (1/T2 - 1/373.15)\n\nNow, we need to solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 - 1/373.15 = 0.051293 / -4893.32\n\n1/T2 - 1/373.15 = -1.0477 * 10^(-5)\n\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 + 1.0477 * 10^(-5)\n\n1/T2 = 0.002680\n\nT2 = 1 / 0.002680\n\nT2 ≈ 373.3 K\n\nNow, we can convert the temperature back to Celsius:\n\nT2 = 373.3 K - 273.15 = 100.15°C\n\nSo, the boiling point of water at an atmospheric pressure of 800 mm Hg is approximately 100.15°C."
