    "message_2": "The current temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), or about -270.425 degrees Celsius. This value has been measured with great precision by various experiments, such as the COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellite missions.\n\nThe CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, which was emitted when the universe was around 380,000 years old. At that time, the universe had cooled down enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms, a process known as recombination. This allowed photons to travel freely through space without being scattered by charged particles, and these photons are what we observe today as the CMB.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB and its nearly uniform distribution across the sky provide crucial insights into the early universe and the Big Bang theory. Some of the implications of the CMB temperature are:\n\n1. Confirmation of the Big Bang: The existence of the CMB and its temperature are consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory, providing strong evidence that the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n2. Measurement of the age of the universe: By studying the temperature and other properties of the CMB, scientists can estimate the age of the universe. Current measurements suggest that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old.\n\n3. Evidence for cosmic inflation: The uniformity of the CMB temperature across the sky supports the theory of cosmic inflation, which posits that the universe underwent a brief, rapid expansion in its earliest moments. This expansion would have smoothed out any initial temperature differences, resulting in the nearly uniform temperature we observe today.\n\n4. Determination of the universe's composition: The CMB temperature, along with other observations, allows scientists to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. Current estimates suggest that the universe is composed of about 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n5. Probing the large-scale structure of the universe: Small fluctuations in the CMB temperature, known as anisotropies, provide information about the distribution of matter in the early universe. These fluctuations are the seeds of the large-scale structure we observe today, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is a crucial piece of evidence that helps us understand the early universe, the Big Bang theory, and the large-scale structure and composition of the universe."
