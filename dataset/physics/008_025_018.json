    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, has a mass of approximately 125 GeV/c². The probabilities of the Higgs boson decaying into different particles are given by their branching ratios, which are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nThe branching ratio for the Higgs boson decaying into two photons (γγ) is approximately 0.0023, or 0.23%. This means that, out of 1000 Higgs bosons produced, about 2 or 3 will decay into two photons.\n\nThe branching ratio for the Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons (ZZ) is approximately 0.026, or 2.6%. This means that, out of 1000 Higgs bosons produced, about 26 will decay into two Z bosons.\n\nComparing these probabilities, the Higgs boson is more likely to decay into two Z bosons than into two photons. However, both of these decay channels are relatively rare compared to other decay channels, such as the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (with a branching ratio of about 58%).\n\nThe observed branching ratios at the LHC experiments (ATLAS and CMS) are consistent with the predictions from the Standard Model, providing further evidence for the validity of the model. However, physicists continue to search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions, which could hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model."
