    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat required to convert 200 grams of ice at -10°C to water at 20°C, we need to consider three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C.\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C.\n\nLet's calculate the heat required for each step:\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nWe will use the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity of ice, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.1 J/(g·°C).\n\nQ1 = (200 g) × (2.1 J/(g·°C)) × (0°C - (-10°C))\nQ1 = 200 g × 2.1 J/(g·°C) × 10°C\nQ1 = 4200 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C\nWe will use the formula Q = mL, where Q is the heat, m is the mass, and L is the latent heat of fusion of ice.\n\nQ2 = (200 g) × (334 J/g)\nQ2 = 66800 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 20°C\nWe will use the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nQ3 = (200 g) × (4.18 J/(g·°C)) × (20°C - 0°C)\nQ3 = 200 g × 4.18 J/(g·°C) × 20°C\nQ3 = 16720 J\n\nNow, we will add the heat required for all three steps:\n\nTotal heat required (Q) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3\nQ = 4200 J + 66800 J + 16720 J\nQ = 87720 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to convert 200 grams of ice at -10°C to water at 20°C is 87,720 Joules."
