    "message_2": "To use observations of binary white dwarf systems to calculate the rate of detectable gravitational wave mergers and determine the properties of these waves, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify and observe binary white dwarf systems: First, we need to identify and observe binary white dwarf systems using telescopes and other astronomical instruments. These systems consist of two white dwarf stars orbiting each other, and they are potential sources of gravitational waves due to their accelerating masses.\n\n2. Measure orbital parameters: Next, we need to measure the orbital parameters of these binary systems, such as their orbital period, semi-major axis, and eccentricity. These parameters can be obtained through various methods, including radial velocity measurements, astrometry, and photometry.\n\n3. Calculate gravitational wave frequency and amplitude: Using the measured orbital parameters and the masses of the white dwarfs, we can calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary system. The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system, while the amplitude depends on factors such as the masses of the white dwarfs, their distance from each other, and their distance from Earth.\n\n4. Estimate the merger timescale: We can estimate the timescale for the binary white dwarf system to merge due to gravitational wave emission using the Peters and Mathews formalism. This formalism relates the rate of change of the orbital period to the gravitational wave emission, allowing us to estimate the time it takes for the binary system to merge.\n\n5. Calculate the merger rate: By observing a large number of binary white dwarf systems and estimating their merger timescales, we can calculate the rate of detectable gravitational wave mergers. This can be done by dividing the number of observed binary white dwarf systems by the sum of their merger timescales.\n\n6. Compare with gravitational wave detections: Finally, we can compare our calculated merger rate and the properties of the gravitational waves (frequency and amplitude) with the actual detections made by gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO and Virgo. This comparison will help us understand the efficiency of our detection methods and improve our understanding of binary white dwarf systems and their role in gravitational wave astronomy.\n\nBy following these steps, we can use observations of binary white dwarf systems to calculate the rate of detectable gravitational wave mergers and determine the properties of these waves, such as their frequency and amplitude."
