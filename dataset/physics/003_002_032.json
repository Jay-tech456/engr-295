    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is given by the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field inside the solenoid (in Tesla, T)\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- n is the number of turns per unit length (in turns per meter, turns/m)\n- I is the current flowing through the solenoid (in Amperes, A)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given that the solenoid has 600 turns wound over a length of 50 cm (0.5 m). Therefore, the number of turns per unit length is:\n\nn = (number of turns) / (length)\nn = 600 turns / 0.5 m\nn = 1200 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1200 turns/m) * (0.5 A)\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10^(-6) Tm/A) * (1200 turns/m) * (0.5 A)\nB ≈ 0.94248 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 0.94248 Tesla."
