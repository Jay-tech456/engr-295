    "message_1": "\"A concave mirror has a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 30 cm in front of the mirror. What is the magnification of the image and where is the image located?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification formula is given by:\nM = -v/u\n\nGiven, the focal length (f) is 20 cm, and the object distance (u) is 30 cm. We can now find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula.\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20v) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\nv(30 + 20v) = 20 * 30\n\nSimplify and solve for v:\n\n30v + 20v^2 = 600\n20v^2 + 30v - 600 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nv = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 20, b = 30, and c = -600.\n\nv = (-30 ± √(30² - 4 * 20 * -600)) / (2 * 20)\nv = (-30 ± √(900 + 48000)) / 40\nv = (-30 ± √48900) / 40\n\nThere are two possible values for v:\n\nv1 = (-30 + √48900) / 40 ≈ 60 cm\nv2 = (-30 - √48900) / 40 ≈ -10 cm\n\nHowever, since the image distance (v) should be positive in this context, we will use v1 = 60 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -60/30\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object. The image is located 60 cm in front of the mirror."
