    "message_2": "To calculate the rate at which gas accretes onto a black hole, we can use the Eddington accretion rate formula. The Eddington accretion rate is the maximum rate at which a black hole can accrete mass without producing so much radiation that it pushes the infalling material away.\n\nThe Eddington accretion rate (Ṁ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nṀ = 4πGMm_p / (εσT^4)\n\nwhere:\nG = 6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) (gravitational constant)\nM = mass of the black hole\nm_p = 1.673 × 10^(-27) kg (mass of a proton)\nε = 0.1 (efficiency factor, typically around 10% for black holes)\nσ = 5.67 × 10^(-8) W m^(-2) K^(-4) (Stefan-Boltzmann constant)\nT = temperature of the accretion disk\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10^30 kg\nM = 10^7 solar masses = 10^7 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^37 kg\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Eddington accretion rate formula:\n\nṀ = 4π(6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))(1.989 × 10^37 kg)(1.673 × 10^(-27) kg) / (0.1(5.67 × 10^(-8) W m^(-2) K^(-4))(10^4 K)^4)\n\nṀ ≈ 2.23 × 10^25 kg/s\n\nSo, the rate at which gas accretes onto the black hole is approximately 2.23 × 10^25 kg/s. Keep in mind that this is the maximum accretion rate, and the actual rate could be lower depending on the specific conditions of the black hole and its environment."
