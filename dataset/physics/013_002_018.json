    "message_2": "A star with a mass 10 times greater than that of our Sun will have a significantly shorter life cycle and more complex nucleosynthesis process compared to smaller stars. The life cycle of such a massive star can be divided into several stages:\n\n1. Formation: The star forms from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust, which contracts under the influence of gravity. As the cloud contracts, it heats up and forms a protostar. Once the core temperature reaches around 10 million Kelvin, nuclear fusion begins, and the star enters the main sequence phase.\n\n2. Main Sequence: During this phase, the star fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through the CNO cycle (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle), which is more dominant in massive stars than the proton-proton chain that occurs in smaller stars like our Sun. This phase lasts for about 20 million years for a 10 solar mass star, much shorter than the 10 billion years for a Sun-like star.\n\n3. Post-Main Sequence: After exhausting hydrogen in its core, the star starts fusing helium into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen through the triple-alpha process. The outer layers of the star expand, and it becomes a red supergiant. This phase lasts for a few hundred thousand years.\n\n4. Advanced Nuclear Burning: As the star continues to evolve, it undergoes various nuclear burning stages, fusing heavier elements in its core and shells. These stages include carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning, and silicon burning, which produce elements up to iron. Each of these stages is shorter than the previous one, with silicon burning lasting only a few days.\n\n5. Core Collapse and Supernova: Since iron cannot be fused to release energy, the core becomes unstable and collapses under its own gravity. This leads to a rebound effect, producing a massive shockwave that blows off the outer layers of the star in a supernova explosion. The core may either form a neutron star or, if massive enough, collapse further to form a black hole.\n\n6. Remnant: The remnants of the supernova explosion can form a supernova remnant, which is a rapidly expanding shell of gas and dust. This material can eventually be recycled into new stars and planetary systems.\n\nIn summary, a star with a mass 10 times greater than our Sun has a shorter life cycle and undergoes more advanced nucleosynthesis processes, producing heavier elements up to iron. The star's life ends in a spectacular supernova explosion, leaving behind a neutron star or a black hole."
