    "message_2": "First, we need to find the volume and mass of the cube.\n\nVolume of the cube (V_cube) = length × width × height\nV_cube = 0.1 m × 0.1 m × 0.1 m = 0.001 m³\n\nMass of the cube (m_cube) = density × volume\nm_cube = 8000 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ = 8 kg\n\nNow, we need to find the buoyant force acting on the cube due to the water.\n\nVolume of water displaced (V_water) = V_cube = 0.001 m³\n\nMass of water displaced (m_water) = density × volume\nm_water = 1000 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ = 1 kg\n\nBuoyant force (F_buoyant) = m_water × g\nF_buoyant = 1 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 9.8 N\n\nNext, we need to find the actual weight of the cube.\n\nWeight of the cube (W_cube) = m_cube × g\nW_cube = 8 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 78.4 N\n\nNow, we can find the tension in the thread (T_thread) and the apparent weight of the cube (W_apparent).\n\nTension in the thread (T_thread) = W_cube - F_buoyant\nT_thread = 78.4 N - 9.8 N = 68.6 N\n\nThe apparent weight of the cube (W_apparent) is the same as the tension in the thread.\n\nW_apparent = T_thread = 68.6 N\n\nSo, the tension in the thread is 68.6 N, and the apparent weight of the cube is 68.6 N."
