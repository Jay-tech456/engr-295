    "message_2": "Cosmic inflation theory is a widely accepted model in cosmology that explains the origin of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. It postulates that the universe underwent a rapid exponential expansion in the first fraction of a second (around 10^-36 seconds) after the Big Bang. This expansion was driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density, which caused the universe to grow by a factor of at least 10^26 in size.\n\nThe cosmic inflation theory addresses several problems in the standard Big Bang model, including the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and the monopole problem. It also provides a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nDuring the inflationary period, tiny quantum fluctuations in the early universe were stretched to macroscopic scales. These fluctuations, which are essentially tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime, became the seeds for the formation of large-scale structures. As the universe continued to expand and cool, these fluctuations grew due to gravitational instability, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other cosmic structures.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang, provides strong evidence for cosmic inflation. Observations of the CMB have revealed tiny temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the predictions of the inflationary model. These temperature fluctuations correspond to the density variations in the early universe that eventually led to the formation of large-scale structures.\n\nIn summary, cosmic inflation theory explains the origin of large-scale structures in the universe by postulating a rapid exponential expansion in the early universe, which stretched quantum fluctuations to macroscopic scales. These fluctuations then acted as seeds for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters through gravitational instability as the universe continued to expand and cool."
