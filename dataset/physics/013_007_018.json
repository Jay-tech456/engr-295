    "message_2": "The rotational curve of a typical spiral galaxy is a graph that represents the relationship between the orbital velocity of stars and other celestial objects in the galaxy and their distance from the galactic center. In other words, it shows how fast objects are moving in their orbits around the center of the galaxy as a function of their distance from the center.\n\nAccording to Newtonian physics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the rotational curve to show that the orbital velocity of objects in the galaxy would decrease as their distance from the center increases. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible matter in the galaxy should decrease with distance, causing objects to move more slowly in their orbits.\n\nHowever, observations of spiral galaxies have shown that their rotational curves do not follow this expected pattern. Instead, the orbital velocity of objects in these galaxies remains relatively constant or even increases slightly as their distance from the center increases. This discrepancy between the observed rotational curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter is known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nDark matter is believed to play a significant role in explaining this discrepancy. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect light. However, it does interact with other matter through gravitational forces. The presence of a large amount of dark matter in and around galaxies would provide additional gravitational force, causing the observed flat or slightly increasing rotational curves.\n\nThe current understanding is that dark matter forms a halo around spiral galaxies, with its mass distribution extending well beyond the visible matter. This dark matter halo provides the additional gravitational force needed to keep the orbital velocities of objects in the galaxy relatively constant or slightly increasing with distance from the center. This explanation is supported by various lines of evidence, including gravitational lensing and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, the exact nature and composition of dark matter remain unknown and are the subject of ongoing research in the field of astrophysics."
