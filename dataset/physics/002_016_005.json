    "message_2": "To find the molar mass of the gas, we can use the van der Waals equation, which is a modification of the ideal gas law that accounts for the finite size of gas molecules and their interactions. The van der Waals equation is given by:\n\n[P + a(n/V)²] (V/n - b) = RT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are van der Waals constants.\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of a and b for the gas. We can use the critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) to find these constants:\n\na = (27/64) * (R² * Tc² / Pc)\nb = (R * Tc) / (8 * Pc)\n\nGiven the critical temperature Tc = 100 K and critical pressure Pc = 10 MPa, we can find a and b:\n\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (universal gas constant)\nTc = 100 K\nPc = 10 * 10^6 Pa (converting MPa to Pa)\n\na = (27/64) * (8.314² * 100² / (10 * 10^6))\na ≈ 0.364 J*m³/mol²\n\nb = (8.314 * 100) / (8 * 10 * 10^6)\nb ≈ 1.039 * 10^(-4) m³/mol\n\nNow we can use the given conditions of the gas (V = 0.1 m³, T = 250 K, P = 4 MPa) to find the number of moles (n) using the van der Waals equation:\n\n(4 * 10^6 + a(n/0.1)²) (0.1/n - b) = 8.314 * 250\n\nLet x = n/0.1, then n = 0.1x. The equation becomes:\n\n(4 * 10^6 + a(x)²) (1/x - b) = 8.314 * 250\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n(4 * 10^6 + 0.364x²) (1/x - 1.039 * 10^(-4)) = 2078.5\n\nWe can solve this equation numerically to find the value of x:\n\nx ≈ 44.66\n\nNow we can find the number of moles (n):\n\nn = 0.1x\nn ≈ 4.466 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the molar mass (M) of the gas using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\nM = (PV) / (nRT)\n\nM = (4 * 10^6 * 0.1) / (4.466 * 8.314 * 250)\nM ≈ 34.02 g/mol\n\nSo, the molar mass of the gas is approximately 34.02 g/mol."
