    "message_2": "In a binary black hole system with unequal masses, the characteristics of the gravitational waves produced, such as amplitude and frequency, will vary due to the differences in mass and the resulting dynamics of the system. The gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system can be described by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases.\n\n1. Inspiral phase: In this phase, the two black holes are orbiting each other and gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves. The frequency of the emitted waves increases as the black holes get closer, and the amplitude of the waves depends on the masses of the black holes and their distance from the observer. For unequal masses, the amplitude will be smaller than for equal masses, and the frequency will increase more rapidly as the black holes approach each other.\n\n2. Merger phase: When the black holes finally merge, the gravitational waves' frequency reaches its peak, and the amplitude is at its maximum. The amplitude of the waves during the merger phase depends on the total mass of the system and the mass ratio of the black holes. For unequal masses, the amplitude will be smaller than for equal masses, and the peak frequency will be different due to the different dynamics of the merger.\n\n3. Ringdown phase: After the merger, the newly formed black hole settles down to a stable state, emitting gravitational waves as it does so. The frequency and amplitude of the waves during the ringdown phase depend on the properties of the final black hole, such as its mass and spin. For unequal masses, the final black hole's mass and spin will be different than for equal masses, leading to different ringdown frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nIn summary, the characteristics of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses will vary in terms of amplitude and frequency compared to a system with equal masses. The amplitude will generally be smaller, and the frequency will change more rapidly during the inspiral phase and have different peak values during the merger and ringdown phases."
