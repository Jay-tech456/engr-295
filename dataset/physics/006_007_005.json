    "message_2": "In a Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated by an electric field and collide with mercury atoms, causing them to become excited. The minimum accelerating voltage required to excite the mercury atoms is the voltage needed to provide the electrons with enough kinetic energy to overcome the ground state energy of the mercury atoms.\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of the electrons can be calculated using the equation:\n\nKE = eV\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C) and V is the accelerating voltage.\n\nThe minimum accelerating voltage required to excite the mercury atoms is when the kinetic energy of the electrons is equal to the ground state energy of the mercury atoms:\n\nKE = E_ground_state\n\neV = 4.9 eV\n\nSince eV is in electron-volts, we can directly equate the accelerating voltage to the ground state energy:\n\nV = 4.9 V\n\nTherefore, the minimum accelerating voltage required to excite the mercury atoms in a Franck-Hertz experiment is 4.9 volts. The distance between the cathode and the anode does not affect the minimum accelerating voltage required in this case."
