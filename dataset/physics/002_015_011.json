    "message_1": "A heat pump is used to maintain the temperature of a house at 25°C when the outside temperature is -5°C. The heat pump requires an input power of 4 kW to extract heat from the outside air and deliver it to the house. If the heat pump has a coefficient of performance of 3.5, what is the rate of heat transfer from the outside air to the house?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the house (Q_H) to the work input (W) required to run the heat pump. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\n\nWe are given the COP as 3.5 and the input power (W) as 4 kW. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the rate of heat transfer (Q_H):\n\nQ_H = COP * W\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nQ_H = 3.5 * 4 kW\n\nQ_H = 14 kW\n\nSo, the rate of heat transfer from the outside air to the house is 14 kW."
