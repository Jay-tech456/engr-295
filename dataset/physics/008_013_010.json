    "message_2": "The decay of a tau lepton into a muon, anti-muon neutrino, and tau neutrino is a leptonic decay mediated by the weak force through the exchange of a W boson. The same process occurs for the decay of a tau lepton into an electron, anti-electron neutrino, and tau neutrino. The branching fraction of these decays is determined by the ratio of the decay rate for each channel to the total decay rate of the tau lepton.\n\nThe branching fractions for these decays are approximately equal due to the lepton universality principle, which states that the weak force coupling constants are the same for all leptons. This principle is a consequence of the underlying gauge symmetry of the electroweak interaction in the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nThe branching fraction for the decay of a tau lepton into a muon, anti-muon neutrino, and tau neutrino is approximately 17.4%. Similarly, the branching fraction for the decay of a tau lepton into an electron, anti-electron neutrino, and tau neutrino is also approximately 17.8%. These values are very close, which supports the lepton universality principle.\n\nIn summary, the branching fractions for the decay of a tau lepton into a muon, anti-muon neutrino, and tau neutrino and the decay into an electron, anti-electron neutrino, and tau neutrino are approximately equal and close to 17.4% and 17.8%, respectively. This similarity is a consequence of the lepton universality principle in the Standard Model of particle physics."
