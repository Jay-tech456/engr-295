    "message_2": "To achieve nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms, we need to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. The minimum temperature required for this process is known as the ignition temperature. For deuterium fusion, the ignition temperature is approximately 15 million Kelvin (15 x 10^6 K).\n\nTo calculate the corresponding energy required for fusion to occur, we can use the Boltzmann constant (k) and the ignition temperature (T). The Boltzmann constant is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nEnergy (E) = k * T\n\nE = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) * (15 x 10^6 K)\n\nE â‰ˆ 3.07 x 10^(-17) J\n\nSo, the corresponding energy required for nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms is approximately 3.07 x 10^(-17) Joules."
