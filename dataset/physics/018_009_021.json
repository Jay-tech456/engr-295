    "message_2": "The relationship between the entropy (S) and temperature (T) of a black hole can be described using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. According to this formula, the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon's surface area (A). The formula is given by:\n\nS = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe temperature of a black hole, also known as its Hawking temperature, is inversely proportional to its mass (M) and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = (hbar * c^3) / (8 * pi * G * M * k)\n\nFrom these two formulas, we can see that the entropy and temperature of a black hole are related through their dependence on the black hole's mass and the fundamental constants of nature. As the mass of a black hole increases, its entropy increases, while its temperature decreases."
