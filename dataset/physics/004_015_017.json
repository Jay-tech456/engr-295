    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several lines of evidence that suggest the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: According to Newtonian dynamics, the velocity of stars in a galaxy should decrease as we move away from the galactic center. However, observations show that the velocities of stars remain roughly constant at large distances from the center, implying that there is more mass present than what is visible. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, is known as gravitational lensing. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass in these clusters, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to determine the density of both ordinary and dark matter. Observations show that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Dark matter acts as a gravitational scaffold that attracts ordinary matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nDark matter is believed to interact with regular matter primarily through gravity, as described by General Relativity. While dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, it does have a gravitational influence on visible matter. This gravitational interaction is responsible for the observed effects on galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to directly detect dark matter particles through experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and various underground detectors. However, as of now, dark matter has not been directly observed, and its exact nature remains unknown."
