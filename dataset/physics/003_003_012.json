    "message_1": "A toroid has 500 turns, a radius of 0.1 m, and a height of 0.2 m. If a current of 2 A is passed through it, what is the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, 0.05 m away from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law. The magnetic field (B) inside a toroid is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nN = number of turns (500 turns)\nI = current (2 A)\nr = distance from the center of the toroid to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated (0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 1000) / 0.1\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-4)) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, 0.05 m away from the center of the toroid, is approximately 4π × 10^(-4) T or 1.26 × 10^(-3) T."
