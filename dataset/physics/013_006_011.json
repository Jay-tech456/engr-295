    "message_2": "A Type II supernova explosion occurs when a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life. The total energy released during a Type II supernova explosion is typically on the order of 10^44 joules (or 10^51 ergs). This energy is distributed over several channels, including kinetic energy of the ejected material, neutrinos, and electromagnetic radiation.\n\n1. Kinetic energy of the ejected material: The majority of the total energy released during a Type II supernova goes into the kinetic energy of the ejected material, which is approximately 1% of the total energy, or around 10^42 joules (10^49 ergs). This energy is responsible for the motion of the expanding supernova remnant.\n\n2. Neutrinos: Neutrinos carry away a significant portion of the total energy released during a Type II supernova explosion. About 99% of the total energy, or around 10^44 joules (10^51 ergs), is released in the form of neutrinos. Neutrinos are weakly interacting particles, and they escape the core of the collapsing star almost immediately, carrying away energy and contributing to the cooling of the core.\n\n3. Electromagnetic radiation: A small fraction of the total energy released during a Type II supernova explosion is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, X-rays, and gamma rays. This energy is on the order of 10^41 joules (10^48 ergs) and is responsible for the bright optical display that we observe as a supernova.\n\nIn summary, for a Type II supernova explosion produced by the gravitational collapse of a massive star with a zero-age main sequence mass of 20 solar masses, the total energy released is approximately 10^44 joules (10^51 ergs). The energy distribution over the different channels of energy release is roughly 1% in the kinetic energy of the ejected material, 99% in neutrinos, and a small fraction in electromagnetic radiation."
