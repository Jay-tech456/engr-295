    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the latent heat of vaporization of water using a simple experiment. The student sets up a container with a known mass of water and heats it until it boils. The steam is then collected in a container cooled with ice, where it condenses back into water. The mass of the condensed water and the change in temperature of the ice are recorded. Given that the specific heat capacity of ice is 2.03 J/g°C and the mass of the ice used is 50g, what is the latent heat of vaporization of water in J/g (assuming no heat loss to the surroundings)?",
    "message_2": "To determine the latent heat of vaporization of water, we need to know the mass of the condensed water (m_water) and the change in temperature of the ice (ΔT_ice). Unfortunately, these values are not provided in the problem statement. However, I can provide you with the formula to calculate the latent heat of vaporization once you have these values.\n\nThe energy absorbed by the ice can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ_ice = m_ice × c_ice × ΔT_ice\n\nwhere Q_ice is the energy absorbed by the ice, m_ice is the mass of the ice (50 g), c_ice is the specific heat capacity of ice (2.03 J/g°C), and ΔT_ice is the change in temperature of the ice.\n\nSince there is no heat loss to the surroundings, the energy absorbed by the ice is equal to the energy released by the condensed water:\n\nQ_ice = m_water × L_v\n\nwhere L_v is the latent heat of vaporization of water.\n\nNow, we can solve for L_v:\n\nL_v = Q_ice / m_water\n\nOnce you have the mass of the condensed water and the change in temperature of the ice, you can use these formulas to calculate the latent heat of vaporization of water in J/g."
