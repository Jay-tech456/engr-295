    "message_2": "The discrepancy between the observed gravitational effects and the visible matter in galaxies is known as the \"missing mass\" or \"dark matter\" problem. This issue was first identified by astronomer Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s when he noticed that the mass of galaxy clusters, as inferred from their gravitational effects, was much greater than the mass of the visible matter within them. This discrepancy has since been confirmed through various observations, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for this discrepancy:\n\n1. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): This hypothesis suggests that our understanding of gravity on galactic scales might be incomplete, and that the laws of gravity need to be modified. MOND proposes that the gravitational force experienced by an object depends on its acceleration relative to a universal constant. While MOND can explain some of the observed discrepancies, it struggles to account for all the observed phenomena related to dark matter.\n\n2. Baryonic dark matter: This explanation proposes that the missing mass is composed of ordinary (baryonic) matter that is not easily detectable, such as brown dwarfs, black holes, or cold gas clouds. However, studies of nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background radiation suggest that baryonic matter can only account for a small fraction of the total dark matter.\n\n3. Non-baryonic dark matter: This hypothesis suggests that the missing mass is composed of non-baryonic particles that do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making them invisible to our telescopes. This is the most widely accepted explanation for the dark matter problem. Non-baryonic dark matter can be further divided into two categories: hot dark matter (HDM) and cold dark matter (CDM). HDM consists of fast-moving particles like neutrinos, while CDM is composed of slower-moving particles. Observations of large-scale structure formation in the universe favor the CDM scenario.\n\nIn the context of general relativity, the concept of dark matter contributes to resolving the dark matter problem by providing an additional source of mass-energy that influences the curvature of spacetime. This additional mass-energy, in the form of non-baryonic dark matter, can account for the observed gravitational effects without requiring modifications to the laws of gravity. The presence of dark matter can also help explain the observed distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nCurrent research is focused on identifying the nature of non-baryonic dark matter particles. Some of the leading candidates include weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos. Experiments are underway to directly detect these particles or to observe their effects on astrophysical phenomena."
