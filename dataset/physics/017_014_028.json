    "message_2": "The critical temperature at which the ferromagnetic phase transitions to the paramagnetic phase in a sample of iron is called the Curie temperature (Tc). For iron, the Curie temperature is approximately 1043 K (770 °C or 1418 °F).\n\nTo determine the Curie temperature experimentally, one can use several methods, such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, magnetization measurements, or specific heat measurements. Here, I will describe the magnetic susceptibility method.\n\nMagnetic susceptibility (χ) is a measure of how much a material becomes magnetized when subjected to an external magnetic field. In the ferromagnetic phase, the magnetic susceptibility is high, while in the paramagnetic phase, it is much lower. The Curie temperature is the point at which there is a sharp change in magnetic susceptibility.\n\nExperimental procedure:\n\n1. Prepare a sample of iron with a known mass and dimensions. Ensure that the sample is clean and free of impurities that could affect the magnetic properties.\n\n2. Set up a device to measure the magnetic susceptibility of the sample. This can be done using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer or an alternating current (AC) susceptometer.\n\n3. Place the iron sample in the measuring device and apply a small external magnetic field. The field should be strong enough to induce a measurable magnetization in the sample but not so strong that it causes saturation or other nonlinear effects.\n\n4. Gradually increase the temperature of the sample while continuously measuring its magnetic susceptibility. This can be done using a temperature-controlled furnace or a cryostat, depending on the temperature range of interest.\n\n5. Record the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature. The data should show a sharp change in susceptibility at the Curie temperature.\n\n6. Analyze the data to determine the precise temperature at which the susceptibility changes. This can be done by fitting the data to a suitable theoretical model, such as the Curie-Weiss law, or by using numerical methods to find the point of maximum change in susceptibility.\n\nThe temperature at which the sharp change in magnetic susceptibility occurs is the Curie temperature, which marks the transition from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase in the iron sample."
