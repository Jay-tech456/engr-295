    "message_2": "The critical temperature of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition is the temperature at which quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of matter, undergo a transition from a confined state to a deconfined state. In this deconfined state, quarks and gluons are no longer bound within protons and neutrons and instead form a new state of matter called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\n\nThe critical temperature of the QCD phase transition is estimated to be around 150-170 MeV (million electron volts), which corresponds to approximately 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin. This value is derived from lattice QCD calculations, which are numerical simulations of QCD on a discrete spacetime lattice.\n\nIn the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, the temperature was extremely high, and quarks and gluons existed in a deconfined state as a quark-gluon plasma. As the universe expanded and cooled, the temperature dropped below the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition, and quarks and gluons became confined within protons and neutrons, forming the hadronic matter that we observe today.\n\nUnderstanding the QCD phase transition and the properties of quark-gluon plasma is crucial for understanding the early universe's evolution and the fundamental properties of matter under extreme conditions. Current experimental research, such as the experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), aims to recreate and study the quark-gluon plasma to gain insights into the QCD phase transition and the strong force that governs the behavior of quarks and gluons."
