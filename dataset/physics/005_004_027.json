    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic momentum and the total energy of the proton, we need to use the following formulas:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p) formula:\np = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\n2. Total energy (E) formula:\nE = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nGiven that the proton travels at a velocity of 0.8c, we can plug in the values into the formulas. The mass of a proton (m) is approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p):\np = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * 0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (0.8^2))\np = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * 2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = (4.008 x 10^-19 kg m/s) / sqrt(0.36)\np = 4.008 x 10^-19 kg m/s / 0.6\np ≈ 6.68 x 10^-19 kg m/s\n\nThe relativistic momentum of the proton is approximately 6.68 x 10^-19 kg m/s.\n\n2. Total energy (E):\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) / sqrt(1 - (0.8^2))\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE = (1.503 x 10^-10 kg m^2/s^2) / sqrt(0.36)\nE = 1.503 x 10^-10 kg m^2/s^2 / 0.6\nE ≈ 2.505 x 10^-10 kg m^2/s^2\n\nSince 1 Joule (J) is equal to 1 kg m^2/s^2, the total energy of the proton is approximately 2.505 x 10^-10 J."
