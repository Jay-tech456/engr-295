    "message_1": "What is the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the denaturation of a specific protein at a temperature of 37°C, given the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the entropy change (ΔS) of the process are -150 kJ/mol and -0.5 kJ/(mol K), respectively?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the denaturation of the protein, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = 37°C + 273.15 = 310.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-150 kJ/mol) - (310.15 K × -0.5 kJ/(mol K))\n\nΔG = -150 kJ/mol + 155.075 kJ/mol\n\nΔG = 5.075 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the denaturation of the protein at 37°C is 5.075 kJ/mol."
