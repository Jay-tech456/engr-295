    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the chirp mass formula and the relationship between the chirp mass and the frequency of gravitational waves.\n\nThe chirp mass (M_c) is given by the formula:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. Since the total mass of the system is 3 solar masses and the final object is not a black hole, we can assume that the masses of the two neutron stars are roughly equal (1.5 solar masses each). This is a reasonable assumption, as the maximum mass of a neutron star before collapsing into a black hole is around 2-2.5 solar masses.\n\nUsing the chirp mass formula:\n\nM_c = (1.5 * 1.5)^(3/5) / (1.5 + 1.5)^(1/5)\nM_c ≈ 1.19 solar masses\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between the chirp mass and the frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96 * π^(-8/3) * (M_c * M_sun)^(-5/3) * (dE/df)^(-1))\n\nwhere f is the frequency of gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M_sun is the mass of the Sun in kilograms, and dE/df is the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves.\n\nFor neutron star mergers, the energy spectrum (dE/df) can be approximated as constant. Therefore, we can simplify the equation:\n\nf ∝ (M_c)^(-5/3)\n\nSince we are interested in the frequency at the moment of the merger, we can use the peak frequency (f_peak) as an estimate:\n\nf_peak ∝ (M_c)^(-5/3)\n\nUsing the chirp mass we calculated earlier:\n\nf_peak ∝ (1.19)^(-5/3)\nf_peak ∝ 0.64\n\nThe proportionality constant depends on the specific properties of the neutron star merger, but we can use the value for a typical neutron star merger to estimate the frequency. For a typical neutron star merger, the peak frequency is around 1000 Hz.\n\nf_peak ≈ 0.64 * 1000 Hz\nf_peak ≈ 640 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger with a total mass of 3 solar masses and a final object that is not a black hole is approximately 640 Hz."
