    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven:\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.2 m\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / ((0.01 m² + 0.04 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (0.05 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB ≈ (2.51 × 10^(-8) Tm) / 0.1118 m\n\nB ≈ 2.25 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, 0.2m away from the center of the loop, is approximately 2.25 × 10^(-7) T (Tesla)."
