    "message_1": "A solenoid has 1000 turns and a length of 50 cm. If a current of 2 A flows through the solenoid, what is the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of solenoid\nn = 1000 turns / 0.5 m\nn = 2000 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2000 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB ≈ 5.026548 × 10⁻³ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 5.03 mT (millitesla)."
