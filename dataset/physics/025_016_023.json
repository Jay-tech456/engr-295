    "message_2": "The equation that relates the standard free energy change (ΔG°) of a metabolic reaction to the concentration of reactants and products at physiological conditions is the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere:\n- ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change under non-standard conditions\n- ΔG° is the standard free energy change\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n- ln(Q) is the natural logarithm of the reaction quotient (Q), which is the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nThe spontaneity of the reaction is determined by the sign of ΔG:\n- If ΔG < 0, the reaction is spontaneous (exergonic).\n- If ΔG > 0, the reaction is non-spontaneous (endergonic).\n- If ΔG = 0, the reaction is at equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium constant (K) is related to the standard free energy change by the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(K)\n\nAt equilibrium, ΔG = 0, and the reaction quotient Q equals the equilibrium constant K. Therefore, the relationship between ΔG°, K, and the spontaneity of the reaction can be summarized as follows:\n- If ΔG° < 0, K > 1, and the reaction favors the formation of products.\n- If ΔG° > 0, K < 1, and the reaction favors the formation of reactants.\n- If ΔG° = 0, K = 1, and the reaction is at equilibrium."
