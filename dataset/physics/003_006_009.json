    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of a circular current-carrying coil, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * 0.2 m)\n\nB = (10π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 0.4 m\n\nB = 25π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 7.85 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 7.85 × 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, without knowing the direction of the current, we cannot determine the exact direction of the magnetic field. However, it will be perpendicular to the plane of the coil."
