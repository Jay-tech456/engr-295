    "message_2": "To calculate the expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, we need to know the differential neutrino flux, Φ(E), as a function of energy, E. Since the energy spectrum is given as E^-2, we can write the differential flux as:\n\nΦ(E) = k * E^-2\n\nwhere k is a constant that depends on the overall normalization of the flux. The units of Φ(E) are typically given in cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 GeV^-1.\n\nTo find the total expected number of neutrinos detected, we need to integrate the differential flux over the energy range of interest, multiply by the effective area of the detector (A_eff), and the livetime (T) of the detector. We also need to convert the units of the effective area to cm^2. Since the detector has an effective area of 1 square kilometer, we have:\n\nA_eff = 1 km^2 = 1 x 10^10 cm^2\n\nAssuming a livetime of 10 years, we have:\n\nT = 10 years = 10 x 365.25 x 24 x 60 x 60 s ≈ 3.15 x 10^8 s\n\nNow, we need to integrate the differential flux over the energy range of interest. Let's assume the energy range of interest is from E_min to E_max. Then, the total number of neutrinos detected, N, can be calculated as:\n\nN = A_eff * T * ∫[Φ(E) dE] from E_min to E_max\n\nN = A_eff * T * k * ∫[E^-2 dE] from E_min to E_max\n\nIntegrating E^-2 with respect to E, we get:\n\n∫[E^-2 dE] = -E^-1\n\nSo,\n\nN = A_eff * T * k * [-E^-1] from E_min to E_max\n\nN = A_eff * T * k * (E_min^-1 - E_max^-1)\n\nTo find the expected flux, we need to divide the total number of neutrinos detected by the effective area and livetime:\n\nExpected flux = N / (A_eff * T)\n\nHowever, without knowing the value of the constant k and the energy range (E_min and E_max), we cannot provide a numerical value for the expected flux. The constant k depends on the overall normalization of the flux, which is determined by astrophysical observations and theoretical models. Once you have the value of k and the energy range, you can plug them into the above equations to find the expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos for the given detector."
