    "message_1": "A student is using a refrigeration system to cool a laboratory to 18Â°C. The system has a coefficient of performance of 4.5 and consumes 800 watts of power. What is the amount of heat that is removed from the laboratory by the refrigeration system in 1 hour?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigeration system is the ratio of the heat removed from the system (Q_c) to the work input (W) required to run the system. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nWe are given the COP as 4.5 and the power consumption (work input) as 800 watts. We can rearrange the formula to find the heat removed from the laboratory (Q_c):\n\nQ_c = COP * W\n\nQ_c = 4.5 * 800\n\nQ_c = 3600 watts\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of heat removed in 1 hour. Since power is energy per unit time (watts = joules/second), we can convert the power to energy by multiplying it by the time in seconds:\n\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\nEnergy removed in 1 hour = Q_c * time\n\nEnergy removed in 1 hour = 3600 watts * 3600 seconds\n\nEnergy removed in 1 hour = 12,960,000 joules\n\nSo, the refrigeration system removes 12,960,000 joules of heat from the laboratory in 1 hour."
