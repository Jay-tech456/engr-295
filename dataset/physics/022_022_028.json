    "message_2": "The predicted effect of dark atoms or dark molecules on the acoustic oscillations seen in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation depends on the specific properties of these dark matter candidates. However, we can discuss some general differences between the effects of interacting dark matter (such as dark atoms/molecules) and non-interacting dark matter particles on the CMB.\n\nAcoustic oscillations in the CMB are the result of the interplay between radiation pressure and gravitational forces in the early universe. These oscillations manifest as temperature fluctuations in the CMB and provide valuable information about the composition and evolution of the universe.\n\nNon-interacting dark matter particles, also known as cold dark matter (CDM), do not interact with radiation or baryonic matter, except through gravity. Their primary effect on the CMB is to enhance the gravitational potential wells, which affects the amplitude of the acoustic oscillations. CDM also influences the matter-radiation equality epoch, which determines the scale of the first peak in the CMB power spectrum.\n\nDark atoms or dark molecules, on the other hand, are examples of interacting dark matter. They can interact with each other through some unknown force, forming bound states or even dark matter \"chemistry.\" The presence of these interacting dark matter particles can have several effects on the CMB acoustic oscillations:\n\n1. Altered expansion history: Interactions between dark atoms/molecules can change the expansion history of the universe, which in turn affects the CMB power spectrum. This can lead to shifts in the positions of the peaks and troughs in the CMB power spectrum.\n\n2. Damping of small-scale fluctuations: Interactions among dark atoms/molecules can lead to dissipative processes, such as dark photon emission or absorption. This can result in the damping of small-scale fluctuations in the CMB, similar to the Silk damping effect in baryonic matter.\n\n3. Modified growth of structure: The presence of interacting dark matter can affect the growth of cosmic structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. This can influence the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, which contributes to the low multipoles of the CMB power spectrum.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark atoms/molecules can affect the CMB acoustic oscillations differently than non-interacting dark matter particles, mainly due to their interactions. These effects can lead to changes in the CMB power spectrum, which can provide clues about the nature of dark matter and its role in the evolution of the universe. However, the specific effects depend on the properties of the dark atoms/molecules, and further research is needed to constrain these models and their implications for the CMB."
