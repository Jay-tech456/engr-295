    "message_2": "To determine the hydraulic resistance of the microchannel, we can use the following formula:\n\nR = (12 * μ * L) / (w * h^3 * (1 - 0.63 * (h / w)))\n\nwhere R is the hydraulic resistance, μ is the fluid viscosity, L is the length of the microchannel, w is the width of the microchannel, and h is the height of the microchannel.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given dimensions to meters:\n\nWidth (w) = 100 μm = 100 * 10^(-6) m = 1 * 10^(-4) m\nHeight (h) = 50 μm = 50 * 10^(-6) m = 5 * 10^(-5) m\nLength (L) = 10 mm = 10 * 10^(-3) m = 0.01 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nR = (12 * 0.001 * 0.01) / (1 * 10^(-4) * (5 * 10^(-5))^3 * (1 - 0.63 * (5 * 10^(-5) / 1 * 10^(-4))))\nR = (12 * 0.001 * 0.01) / (1 * 10^(-4) * 1.25 * 10^(-13) * (1 - 0.63 * 0.5))\nR = (12 * 0.001 * 0.01) / (1 * 10^(-4) * 1.25 * 10^(-13) * 0.685)\nR = (0.00012) / (8.625 * 10^(-18))\nR = 1.39 * 10^13 Pa·s/m³\n\nThe hydraulic resistance of the microchannel is approximately 1.39 * 10^13 Pa·s/m³."
