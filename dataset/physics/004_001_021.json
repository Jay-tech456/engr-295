    "message_2": "To calculate the expected magnitude of a gravitational wave emitted by two merging black holes, we can use the formula for the peak strain amplitude (h) of the gravitational wave:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-1))^(1/3) * (pi * f_peak * D * c^2)^(-1)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system, c is the speed of light, f_peak is the peak frequency of the gravitational wave, and D is the distance to the binary system.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the chirp mass (M_chirp) of the binary system:\n\nM_chirp = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes in solar masses. In this case, m1 = 10 solar masses and m2 = 20 solar masses.\n\nM_chirp = (10 * 20)^(3/5) / (10 + 20)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 13.42 solar masses\n\nNext, we need to calculate the peak frequency (f_peak) of the gravitational wave:\n\nf_peak ≈ 1 / (6^(3/2) * pi * G * M_total * c^(-1))\n\nwhere M_total is the total mass of the binary system (m1 + m2).\n\nM_total = 10 + 20 = 30 solar masses\n\nWe need to convert solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nM_chirp ≈ 13.42 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 2.669 x 10^31 kg\nM_total ≈ 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 5.967 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate f_peak:\n\nf_peak ≈ 1 / (6^(3/2) * pi * G * M_total * c^(-1))\nf_peak ≈ 1 / (6^(3/2) * pi * (6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)) * (5.967 x 10^31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^(-1))\nf_peak ≈ 157.5 Hz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the peak strain amplitude (h) of the gravitational wave:\n\nh ≈ (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-1))^(1/3) * (pi * f_peak * D * c^2)^(-1)\n\nWe need to convert the distance (D) from Gpc to meters:\n\n1 Gpc ≈ 3.086 x 10^25 meters\n\nD = 1 Gpc ≈ 3.086 x 10^25 meters\n\nNow we can calculate h:\n\nh ≈ (4 * (6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)) * (2.669 x 10^31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^(-1))^(1/3) * (pi * 157.5 Hz * (3.086 x 10^25 m) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)^(-1)\nh ≈ 8.9 x 10^(-22)\n\nThe expected magnitude of the gravitational wave emitted by the two merging black holes is approximately 8.9 x 10^(-22).\n\nTo observe such an event, a gravitational wave detector needs to have a sensitivity better than this value. The sensitivity of a detector is usually given in terms of its strain noise amplitude spectral density (ASD) as a function of frequency. To detect a gravitational wave with a strain amplitude of 8.9 x 10^(-22) at a frequency of 157.5 Hz, the detector's ASD should be lower than this value at that frequency. Advanced LIGO, for example, has a sensitivity of around 10^(-23) at frequencies above 100 Hz, which would be sufficient to detect such an event."
