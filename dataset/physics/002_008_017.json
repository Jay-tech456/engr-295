    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of the iron block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (100 Joules), m is the mass of the iron block (200 grams), c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (75°C - 25°C = 50°C).\n\nFirst, we need to rearrange the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nc = 100 J / (200 g × 50°C)\n\nc = 100 J / 10000 g°C\n\nc = 0.01 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the iron block is 0.01 J/g°C."
