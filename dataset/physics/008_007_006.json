    "message_2": "The W and Z bosons are elementary particles that mediate the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. They were first discovered in 1983 at CERN. The masses of these bosons are different, with the W boson being lighter than the Z boson.\n\nThe mass of the W boson is approximately 80.4 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), while the mass of the Z boson is approximately 91.2 GeV/c². The difference in their masses is about 10.8 GeV/c².\n\nIn the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the masses of the W and Z bosons can be measured using proton-proton collisions. When protons collide at high energies, they can produce W and Z bosons, which then decay into other particles. The decay products can be detected and measured by the LHC's detectors, such as the ATLAS and CMS experiments.\n\nFor the W boson, it can decay into a lepton (electron, muon, or tau) and a corresponding neutrino. The Z boson can decay into a pair of leptons (e.g., electron-positron, muon-antimuon, or tau-antitau) or a pair of quarks. By analyzing the energies and momenta of the decay products, physicists can reconstruct the invariant mass of the parent particle (W or Z boson) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nThe distribution of these reconstructed invariant masses will show peaks at the masses of the W and Z bosons. By fitting the data to a theoretical model, the masses of the W and Z bosons can be extracted with high precision. This allows physicists to measure the difference in their masses and study the properties of the weak nuclear force."
