    "message_2": "The maximum mass of a star that can become a neutron star after a gravitational collapse, according to the theory of general relativity, is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is the maximum mass that a compact object, such as a neutron star, can have before it collapses into a black hole.\n\nThe exact value of the TOV limit depends on the equation of state of the neutron star's matter, which is still an area of active research. However, current estimates place the TOV limit at around 2 to 2.5 solar masses. If a star has a mass above this limit, it will likely collapse into a black hole instead of becoming a neutron star."
