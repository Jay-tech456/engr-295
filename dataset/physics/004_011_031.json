    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a charged, non-rotating black hole solution in general relativity. The electric potential outside a Reissner-Nordström black hole can be described by the following formula:\n\nΦ(r) = Q / (4πε₀r)\n\nHere, Φ(r) is the electric potential at a radial distance r from the black hole, Q is the charge of the black hole, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nOn the other hand, a Schwarzschild black hole is an uncharged, non-rotating black hole solution. Since it has no charge, the electric potential outside a Schwarzschild black hole is zero:\n\nΦ(r) = 0\n\nThe physical significance of the differences between the two formulas lies in the presence of the electric charge in the Reissner-Nordström black hole. The charged black hole generates an electric field around it, which in turn creates an electric potential that varies with the radial distance from the black hole. This electric potential can influence the motion of charged particles in the vicinity of the black hole, causing them to experience an additional force due to the electric field.\n\nIn contrast, the Schwarzschild black hole has no charge and thus does not generate an electric field or electric potential. The motion of particles around a Schwarzschild black hole is solely determined by the gravitational field, which is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nIn summary, the electric potential outside a Reissner-Nordström black hole is given by Φ(r) = Q / (4πε₀r), while the electric potential outside a Schwarzschild black hole is zero. The presence of the electric charge in the Reissner-Nordström black hole leads to an additional electric force on charged particles, which is not present in the case of the Schwarzschild black hole."
