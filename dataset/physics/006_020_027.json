    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section, we need to use the Mott formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z * e^2 / (4 * E * sin^2(θ/2)))^2 * (1 - β^2 * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\ndσ/dΩ is the differential cross section\nZ is the atomic number of the target (Aluminum, Z = 13)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nE is the energy of the scattered particle (200 keV = 200 x 10^3 eV)\nθ is the scattering angle (30 degrees)\nβ is the ratio of the particle's speed to the speed of light (v/c)\n\nFirst, let's find β. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE = m * c^2 * (1 / sqrt(1 - β^2))\n\nRearranging for β:\n\nβ^2 = 1 - (m * c^2 / E)^2\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m * c^2 / E)^2)\n\nFor an electron, m = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg, and c = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values:\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (9.109 x 10^-31 * (2.998 x 10^8)^2 / (200 x 10^3 * 1.602 x 10^-19))^2)\nβ ≈ 0.881\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Mott formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (13 * 1.602 x 10^-19 / (4 * 200 x 10^3 * sin^2(15)))^2 * (1 - 0.881^2 * sin^2(15))\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 2.76 x 10^-28 m^2/sr\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for an aluminum atom with a scattered particle of 200 keV and an angle of 30 degrees relative to the incident beam is approximately 2.76 x 10^-28 m^2/sr."
