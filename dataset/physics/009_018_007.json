If the distance between the central maximum and the 4th order maximum is 4 cm, what is the distance between the central maximum and the 5th order maximum?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central maximum and the 5th order maximum, we can use the formula for the position of the maxima in a double-slit experiment:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance from the central maximum to the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nWe are given that the distance between the central maximum and the 4th order maximum (m = 4) is 4 cm. We can use this information to find the constant factor (λ * L) / d:\n\n4 cm = (4 * λ * L) / d\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\n4 cm = (4 * 500 nm * 2 m) / 0.2 mm\n\nConverting units:\n\n4 cm = (4 * 500 * 10^(-9) m * 2 m) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nSolving for the constant factor:\n\n(λ * L) / d = 1 cm\n\nNow we can find the distance between the central maximum and the 5th order maximum (m = 5) using the same formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\ny = (5 * 1 cm)\n\ny = 5 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the 5th order maximum is 5 cm."
