    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure at the bottom of the tank, we can use the formula:\n\nPressure = density × gravity × height\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the tank:\n\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = 3 m × 2 m × 4 m\nVolume = 24 m^3\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the water in the tank:\n\nMass = density × volume\nMass = 1000 kg/m^3 × 24 m^3\nMass = 24000 kg\n\nNext, we can find the weight of the water:\n\nWeight = mass × gravity\nWeight = 24000 kg × 9.8 m/s^2\nWeight = 235200 N\n\nFinally, we can find the pressure at the bottom of the tank:\n\nPressure = density × gravity × height\nPressure = 1000 kg/m^3 × 9.8 m/s^2 × 4 m\nPressure = 39200 Pa\n\nSo, the pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of water is 39200 Pascals (Pa)."
