    "message_2": "The Debye-Hückel limiting law is used to estimate the activity coefficient (γ) of an electrolyte in a solution. The equation for the Debye-Hückel limiting law is:\n\nγ = 10^(-A * |z+ * z-| * √I)\n\nwhere A is the Debye-Hückel constant, z+ and z- are the charges of the cation and anion, and I is the ionic strength of the solution.\n\nFor a 1 M aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), the charges of the cation (Na+) and anion (Cl-) are both 1. The ionic strength (I) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nI = 1/2 * Σ(ci * zi^2)\n\nwhere ci is the concentration of the ion and zi is the charge of the ion. For NaCl, the ionic strength is:\n\nI = 1/2 * [(1 mol/L * (1)^2) + (1 mol/L * (-1)^2)]\nI = 1/2 * (1 + 1)\nI = 1\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Debye-Hückel limiting law equation:\n\nγ = 10^(-A * |z+ * z-| * √I)\nγ = 10^(-0.5091 * |1 * -1| * √1)\nγ = 10^(-0.5091)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nγ ≈ 0.313\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of a 1 M aqueous solution of sodium chloride at 25 °C is approximately 0.313."
