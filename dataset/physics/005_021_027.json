If the light source is moving at 90% of the speed of light relative to the stationary observer, what will be the observed frequency and wavelength of the light according to the observer? Use the equations for relativistic Doppler shift and length contraction to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler shift equation, which is given by:\n\nf_obs = f_source * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f_obs is the observed frequency, f_source is the frequency of the light source, β is the ratio of the speed of the light source (v) to the speed of light (c), and sqrt denotes the square root.\n\nIn this case, the light source is moving at 90% of the speed of light, so β = 0.9. We don't know the frequency of the light source (f_source), so we'll leave it as a variable.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nf_obs = f_source * sqrt((1 + 0.9) / (1 - 0.9))\nf_obs = f_source * sqrt(1.9 / 0.1)\nf_obs = f_source * sqrt(19)\n\nNow, let's find the observed wavelength. The relationship between frequency and wavelength is given by:\n\nc = λ * f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. We can rearrange this equation to find the wavelength:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nSince the frequency is Doppler shifted, we need to use the observed frequency (f_obs) to find the observed wavelength (λ_obs):\n\nλ_obs = c / f_obs\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for f_obs that we found earlier:\n\nλ_obs = c / (f_source * sqrt(19))\n\nTo find the relationship between the observed wavelength and the source wavelength, we can divide the observed wavelength by the source wavelength:\n\nλ_obs / λ_source = (c / (f_source * sqrt(19))) / (c / f_source)\n\nλ_obs / λ_source = 1 / sqrt(19)\n\nSo, the observed frequency is f_source * sqrt(19) times the source frequency, and the observed wavelength is 1 / sqrt(19) times the source wavelength."
