Assume that the distance from Earth to the source of the gravitational waves is one billion light years.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we can use the chirp mass formula and the orbital frequency formula. The chirp mass (M_c) is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. Since the total mass is 2.8 times that of the sun, let's assume that both neutron stars have equal masses, so m1 = m2 = 1.4 * M_sun, where M_sun is the solar mass (1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\nNow, we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_c = ((1.4 * M_sun) * (1.4 * M_sun))^(3/5) / (2.8 * M_sun)^(1/5)\nM_c ≈ 1.17 * M_sun\n\nNext, we can use the orbital frequency formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96 * π^(-8/3) * M_c^(-5/3) * (dP/dt)^(-3/8))\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)), and dP/dt is the rate of change of the orbital period.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to calculate dP/dt. In general, the frequency of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system can range from a few Hz to a few kHz. The frequency increases as the neutron stars get closer and their orbits become faster.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimate of the frequency, we would need more information about the binary system, such as the orbital period, the rate of change of the orbital period, or the separation between the neutron stars."
