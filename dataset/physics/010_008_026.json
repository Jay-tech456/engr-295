    "message_2": "First, we need to find the volume of the wooden block. The volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = length × width × height\n\nThe dimensions of the block are given in centimeters, so we need to convert them to meters:\n\nLength = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nWidth = 8 cm = 0.08 m\nHeight = 6 cm = 0.06 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the block:\n\nVolume = 0.1 m × 0.08 m × 0.06 m = 0.00048 m³\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of the block that will be submerged in water. This can be determined by the ratio of the density of the block to the density of water:\n\nFraction submerged = (Density of block) / (Density of water)\nFraction submerged = (500 kg/m³) / (1000 kg/m³) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the block that will be submerged in water:\n\nVolume submerged = Fraction submerged × Volume of block\nVolume submerged = 0.5 × 0.00048 m³ = 0.00024 m³\n\nFinally, we can calculate the buoyant force acting on the block using Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the block:\n\nBuoyant force = (Volume submerged) × (Density of water) × g\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\n\nBuoyant force = 0.00024 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² = 2.3544 N\n\nSo, the volume of the block that will be submerged in water is 0.00024 m³, and the buoyant force acting on the block is 2.3544 N."
