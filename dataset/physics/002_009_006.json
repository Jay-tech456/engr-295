    "message_2": "The latent heat of fusion (L) is the amount of heat required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid state without changing its temperature. In this case, we are given the mass (m) of the ice, the heat supplied (Q), and the initial temperature of the ice (-10°C). We need to find the latent heat of fusion of ice (L).\n\nFirst, we need to raise the temperature of the ice from -10°C to 0°C. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat supplied, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity of ice (approximately 2100 J/kg·K), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Q:\n\nQ = (200 g) * (2100 J/kg·K) * (10 K)\n\nSince 1 kg = 1000 g, we need to convert the mass to kg:\n\nQ = (0.2 kg) * (2100 J/kg·K) * (10 K)\nQ = 4200 J\n\nNow we know that 4200 J of heat is used to raise the temperature of the ice to 0°C. The remaining heat (8000 J - 4200 J) will be used to melt the ice:\n\nQ_remaining = 8000 J - 4200 J\nQ_remaining = 3800 J\n\nNow we can use the formula for latent heat:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat supplied, m is the mass, and L is the latent heat of fusion. We can rearrange the formula to solve for L:\n\nL = Q / m\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nL = (3800 J) / (0.2 kg)\nL = 19000 J/kg\n\nThe latent heat of fusion of ice at -10°C is approximately 19000 J/kg."
