    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a charged, non-rotating black hole, while the Schwarzschild black hole is an uncharged, non-rotating black hole. The presence of charge in the Reissner-Nordström black hole affects the structure of its event horizon.\n\nThe event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is determined by its mass (M) alone and is given by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs):\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2,\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn contrast, the Reissner-Nordström black hole has two event horizons due to the presence of charge (Q). The radii of these event horizons are given by:\n\nR± = GM/c^2 ± √((GM/c^2)^2 - GQ^2/c^4),\n\nwhere R+ is the outer event horizon and R- is the inner event horizon (also known as the Cauchy horizon).\n\nAs the charge of the Reissner-Nordström black hole increases, the difference between the two event horizons decreases. If the charge becomes equal to the mass (in geometrized units), the two horizons merge, and the black hole becomes an extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. If the charge exceeds the mass, the event horizons disappear, and the black hole becomes a naked singularity, which is a hypothetical object not shielded by an event horizon.\n\nIn summary, the presence of charge in a Reissner-Nordström black hole leads to the existence of two event horizons, while a Schwarzschild black hole has only one event horizon determined solely by its mass. The charge affects the structure of the event horizons and can even lead to the formation of a naked singularity if the charge is greater than the mass."
