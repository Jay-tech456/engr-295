    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -10 cm (concave mirror has a negative focal length)\ndo = 15 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nMultiplying both sides by -30di:\n\n-3di = -2di - 30\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ndi = -30 cm\n\nThe image is formed 30 cm in front of the mirror (the negative sign indicates it's a real image).\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nM = hi/ho = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, hi is the image height, and ho is the object height.\n\nGiven:\nho = 5 cm\n\nWe can now solve for hi:\n\nM = -(-30)/15 = 2\n\nhi = M * ho = 2 * 5 = 10 cm\n\nThe image formed by the concave mirror is 10 cm tall.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed 30 cm in front of the mirror and is 10 cm tall."
