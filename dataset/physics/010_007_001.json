    "message_2": "To determine the buoyant force acting on the block and how much of the block is submerged under water, we can use Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the block:\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = (6 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm) = 48 cm³\n\nNow, let's convert the volume to meters cubed:\n1 m = 100 cm\nVolume = 48 cm³ × (1 m/100 cm)³ = 48 × 10⁻⁶ m³\n\nLet's assume the density of the wood block is ρ_wood. The mass of the block can be calculated as:\nMass = density × volume\nm_block = ρ_wood × 48 × 10⁻⁶ m³\n\nThe weight of the block is:\nW_block = m_block × g\nW_block = ρ_wood × 48 × 10⁻⁶ m³ × 9.8 m/s²\n\nSince the block is floating, the buoyant force (F_buoyant) is equal to the weight of the block:\nF_buoyant = W_block\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the water displaced by the submerged part of the block. Let h be the height of the submerged part of the block. The volume of the displaced water is:\nV_displaced = length × width × h\nV_displaced = 6 cm × 4 cm × h = 24h cm³\n\nConverting to meters cubed:\nV_displaced = 24h × 10⁻⁶ m³\n\nThe mass of the displaced water is:\nm_displaced = ρ_water × V_displaced\nm_displaced = 1000 kg/m³ × 24h × 10⁻⁶ m³\n\nThe weight of the displaced water is:\nW_displaced = m_displaced × g\nW_displaced = 1000 kg/m³ × 24h × 10⁻⁶ m³ × 9.8 m/s²\n\nSince the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water:\nF_buoyant = W_displaced\n\nTherefore, we have:\nρ_wood × 48 × 10⁻⁶ m³ × 9.8 m/s² = 1000 kg/m³ × 24h × 10⁻⁶ m³ × 9.8 m/s²\n\nSolving for h:\nh = (ρ_wood × 48) / (1000 × 24)\nh = ρ_wood / 500\n\nWe don't have the density of the wood block (ρ_wood) given, so we can't find the exact height (h) of the submerged part of the block. However, we can express the height of the submerged part as a fraction of the total height (2 cm) of the block:\nFraction_submerged = h / 2 cm = (ρ_wood / 500) / 2 cm\n\nSo, the fraction of the block submerged under water depends on the density of the wood block (ρ_wood). The buoyant force acting on the block is equal to the weight of the block, which is ρ_wood × 48 × 10⁻⁶ m³ × 9.8 m/s²."
