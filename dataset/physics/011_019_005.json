    "message_1": "Calculate the thermal expansion coefficient of a crystal whose initial length is 2 cm at 293 K and whose final length is 2.08 cm at 323 K. The crystal has a cubic structure with a lattice constant of 4.24 Å. You can assume that the expansion is isotropic.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the crystal, we can use the formula:\n\nα = (ΔL / L_initial) / ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L_initial is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in length (ΔL) and the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔL = L_final - L_initial = 2.08 cm - 2 cm = 0.08 cm\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 323 K - 293 K = 30 K\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nα = (0.08 cm / 2 cm) / 30 K\nα = 0.04 / 30 K\nα = 1.33 × 10^(-3) K^(-1)\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of the crystal is approximately 1.33 × 10^(-3) K^(-1)."
