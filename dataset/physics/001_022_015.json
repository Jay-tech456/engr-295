    "message_2": "To calculate the Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole with a mass of 1 billion solar masses over a period of 1 million years, we will first need to find the temperature of the black hole and then use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the power emitted. Finally, we will multiply the power by the time period to find the total energy emitted.\n\n1. Calculate the mass of the black hole in kilograms:\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n1 billion solar masses = 1 x 10^9 solar masses\nMass of the black hole (M) = 1 x 10^9 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 1.989 x 10^39 kg\n\n2. Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R) of the black hole:\nR = (2 * G * M) / c^2\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\nR ≈ (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 * 1.989 x 10^39) / (2.998 x 10^8)^2 ≈ 2.95 x 10^12 m\n\n3. Calculate the temperature (T) of the black hole using the Hawking temperature formula:\nT = ħ * c^3 / (8 * π * G * M * k_B)\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 Js), and k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K).\nT ≈ (1.054 x 10^-34 * (2.998 x 10^8)^3) / (8 * π * 6.674 x 10^-11 * 1.989 x 10^39 * 1.381 x 10^-23) ≈ 6.17 x 10^-9 K\n\n4. Calculate the power (P) emitted by the black hole using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nP = A * σ * T^4\nwhere A is the surface area of the black hole (4 * π * R^2), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4), and T is the temperature.\nA ≈ 4 * π * (2.95 x 10^12)^2 ≈ 1.097 x 10^26 m^2\nP ≈ 1.097 x 10^26 * 5.67 x 10^-8 * (6.17 x 10^-9)^4 ≈ 9.05 x 10^15 W\n\n5. Calculate the total energy (E) emitted over 1 million years:\n1 million years = 1 x 10^6 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 s ≈ 3.154 x 10^13 s\nE = P * time\nE ≈ 9.05 x 10^15 * 3.154 x 10^13 ≈ 2.86 x 10^29 J\n\nSo, the Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole with a mass of 1 billion solar masses over a period of 1 million years is approximately 2.86 x 10^29 Joules."
