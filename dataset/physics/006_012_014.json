    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in the ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state, so it is equal to the absolute value of the ground state energy:\n\nIonization energy = |-13.6 eV| = 13.6 eV\n\nTo find the wavelength of the photon required to ionize the hydrogen atom, we can use the energy-wavelength relationship for photons:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon. Rearranging the formula to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nFirst, we need to convert the ionization energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so:\n\nIonization energy = 13.6 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.18 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.18 x 10^-18 J) ≈ 9.11 x 10^-8 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon required to ionize a hydrogen atom in the ground state is approximately 9.11 x 10^-8 m or 91.1 nm."
