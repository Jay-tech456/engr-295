    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of a long straight cylinder of radius R carrying a steady current I, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. When r < R (inside the cylinder)\n2. When r > R (outside the cylinder)\n\nCase 1: When r < R (inside the cylinder)\n\nFor this case, we need to find the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the cylinder. We can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field inside the cylinder. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to μ₀ times the current enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the current, we can simplify the equation as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed within the loop of radius r. We can do this by finding the current density (J) in the cylinder. The current density is the current per unit area.\n\nJ = I / (πR^2)\n\nThe enclosed current within the loop of radius r can be found by multiplying the current density by the area enclosed by the loop.\n\nI_enclosed = J * πr^2\n\nSubstitute the expression for J:\n\nI_enclosed = (I / (πR^2)) * πr^2\n\nNow, we can substitute I_enclosed back into the Ampere's law equation:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * (I / (πR^2)) * πr^2\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πR^2)\n\nThis is the magnetic field inside the cylinder (r < R).\n\nCase 2: When r > R (outside the cylinder)\n\nFor this case, we can directly use the given formula:\n\nB = μ₀I / 2R\n\nThis is the magnetic field outside the cylinder (r > R).\n\nIn summary, the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of a long straight cylinder of radius R carrying a steady current I is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πR^2) for r < R (inside the cylinder)\nB = μ₀I / 2R for r > R (outside the cylinder)"
