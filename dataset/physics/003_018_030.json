    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the helix is not a simple loop, we need to consider the geometry of the helix and integrate over its length.\n\nFirst, let's find the pitch (p) of the helix. The pitch angle (α) is given as 30 degrees. We can use the relation:\n\ntan(α) = p / (2πr)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the helix. Rearranging for p, we get:\n\np = 2πr * tan(α)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\np = 2π * 0.05 m * tan(30°) = 0.05π m\n\nNow, let's consider a small segment (dl) of the helix at an angle θ from the axis. The length of this segment can be expressed as:\n\ndl = (p / (2π)) * dθ\n\nThe distance (R) of this segment from the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field is:\n\nR = sqrt(r^2 + (10 cm - r * cos(θ))^2)\n\nThe magnetic field (dB) due to this small segment can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * r * sin(θ)) / (4π * R^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) and I is the current (2 A).\n\nTo find the total magnetic field (B) at the point, we need to integrate dB over the entire helix (0 to 2π):\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl * r * sin(θ)) / (4π * R^3) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nThis integral is quite complex and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., Simpson's rule) to approximate the value of the integral.\n\nUsing a numerical integration tool or software, we can approximate the value of the integral and find the magnetic field at the point 10 cm away from the center of the helix on its axis."
