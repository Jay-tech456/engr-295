    "message_2": "According to the General Theory of Relativity, the deflection of starlight passing close to the sun is caused by the curvature of spacetime due to the sun's mass. The amount of deflection can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nDeflection angle (Î±) = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the sun, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the closest distance between the light ray and the center of the sun).\n\nFor the sun, the deflection angle is approximately 1.75 arcseconds (where 1 arcsecond = 1/3600 of a degree) for light rays grazing the sun's surface.\n\nTo detect and measure these deflections, we can use the gravitational lensing effect. Gravitational lensing occurs when the mass of a foreground object (like the sun) bends the light from a background object (like a distant star), causing the background object to appear distorted or displaced. This effect can be observed during a solar eclipse when the sun's light is blocked, and the positions of stars near the sun can be accurately measured.\n\nTo measure the deflection, astronomers can compare the observed positions of stars near the sun during a solar eclipse with their known positions when the sun is not in the vicinity. The difference in the positions will give the amount of deflection caused by the sun's gravitational field. This method was first used by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 1919, providing one of the earliest confirmations of the General Theory of Relativity."
