    "message_1": "What is the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla? Given that the gyromagnetic ratio for a hydrogen nucleus is 42.58 MHz/T. (Hint: The NMR frequency is the product of the magnetic field strength and gyromagnetic ratio)",
    "message_2": "To find the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla, we can use the formula:\n\nNMR frequency = Magnetic field strength × Gyromagnetic ratio\n\nGiven the magnetic field strength (B) is 1.5 Tesla and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) for a hydrogen nucleus is 42.58 MHz/T, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nNMR frequency = 1.5 T × 42.58 MHz/T\n\nNMR frequency = 63.87 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla is 63.87 MHz."
