    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a speed of 0.7c relative to Earth. The spaceship is equipped with two clocks - Clock A and Clock B. Clock A is stationary on the spaceship, while Clock B moves in the direction of motion at a constant speed of 0.4c. Suppose that Clock A shows a time of 12:00 pm when it passes by Earth. How much time will have passed on Clock B when it reaches Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the dilated time, Δt is the proper time (time experienced by the moving object), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relative velocity of Clock B with respect to Earth. We can use the velocity addition formula for this:\n\nv_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the spaceship (0.7c), v2 is the velocity of Clock B relative to the spaceship (0.4c), and v_rel is the relative velocity of Clock B with respect to Earth.\n\nv_rel = (0.7c + 0.4c) / (1 + (0.7c * 0.4c) / c^2)\nv_rel = (1.1c) / (1 + 0.28)\nv_rel = 1.1c / 1.28\nv_rel ≈ 0.859c\n\nNow we can use the time dilation equation to find the time experienced by Clock B when it reaches Earth. We know that Clock A shows 12:00 pm when it passes by Earth, so we can assume that Δt = 12:00 pm (or 12 hours) for Clock A.\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v_rel^2/c^2)\nΔt' = 12 hours / √(1 - (0.859c)^2/c^2)\nΔt' = 12 hours / √(1 - 0.738)\nΔt' = 12 hours / √(0.262)\nΔt' ≈ 12 hours / 0.512\nΔt' ≈ 23.4 hours\n\nSo, when Clock B reaches Earth, it will show a time of approximately 23.4 hours (or 11:24 am the next day) have passed."
