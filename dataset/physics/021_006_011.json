    "message_2": "The gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole affects the orbits of nearby stars by causing them to move in elliptical or hyperbolic trajectories around the black hole. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole and the star. The closer the star is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational force it experiences.\n\nThere are several parameters that determine whether a star will be pulled into the black hole or escape its grasp:\n\n1. Distance: The closer a star is to the black hole, the more likely it is to be pulled in. Stars that are farther away have a higher chance of escaping the black hole's gravitational pull.\n\n2. Mass of the black hole: The more massive the black hole, the stronger its gravitational pull. This means that stars near a more massive black hole are more likely to be pulled in than those near a less massive one.\n\n3. Velocity of the star: The faster a star is moving, the more likely it is to escape the black hole's gravitational pull. A star with a high enough velocity can achieve escape velocity, allowing it to break free from the black hole's gravitational influence.\n\n4. Orbital parameters: The shape and orientation of a star's orbit around the black hole also play a role in determining its fate. Stars in highly elliptical orbits may come very close to the black hole at their closest approach (periastron) but then move far away at their farthest point (apastron). This can make it more difficult for the black hole to capture the star. On the other hand, stars in more circular orbits are more likely to be pulled in, as they remain closer to the black hole throughout their orbit.\n\nIn summary, the fate of a star near a supermassive black hole depends on a combination of factors, including the distance between the star and the black hole, the mass of the black hole, the star's velocity, and the shape and orientation of its orbit."
