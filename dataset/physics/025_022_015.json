    "message_2": "The elastic modulus of microtubule spindle fibers is not a fixed value, as it can vary depending on factors such as the specific type of microtubule, the presence of associated proteins, and experimental conditions. However, experimental studies have reported values for the elastic modulus of microtubules in the range of 0.1-20 GPa (gigapascals).\n\nIt is important to note that the elastic modulus can be influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, and the presence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that can bind to and stabilize microtubules. Additionally, the elastic modulus can be different for different types of microtubules, such as those found in neurons or those involved in cell division.\n\nIn the context of spindle fibers during cell division, the elastic modulus is likely to be within the range mentioned above, but the specific value would depend on the experimental conditions and the type of cell being studied."
