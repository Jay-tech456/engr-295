    "message_2": "To find the activity coefficient, we can use the van't Hoff equation for osmotic pressure:\n\nΠ = i * c * R * T\n\nwhere Π is the osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor (which is the number of ions produced per molecule of solute), c is the molar concentration of the solute, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor sucrose, the van't Hoff factor (i) is 1, as it does not dissociate into ions in solution. The molar concentration (c) is 0.1 moles per liter, the ideal gas constant (R) is 0.0821 L atm/mol K, and the temperature (T) is 25°C, which is equivalent to 298.15 K.\n\nWe can rearrange the van't Hoff equation to solve for the activity coefficient (i):\n\ni = Π / (c * R * T)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\ni = 1.50 atm / (0.1 mol/L * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * 298.15 K)\n\ni ≈ 0.61\n\nThe activity coefficient of the dilute sucrose solution is approximately 0.61."
