    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, n1 (air) = 1, θ1 = 40 degrees, and n2 (glass) = 1.5. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(40) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = sin(40) / 1.5\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(40) / 1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ2 ≈ 24.79 degrees\n\nNow, let's find the lateral displacement of the ray. We can use the formula:\n\nLateral Displacement = Thickness * (tan(θ1) - tan(θ2))\n\nwhere Thickness is the thickness of the glass slab, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, Thickness = 4 cm, θ1 = 40 degrees, and θ2 ≈ 24.79 degrees.\n\nLateral Displacement = 4 * (tan(40) - tan(24.79))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nLateral Displacement ≈ 1.54 cm\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 24.79 degrees, and the lateral displacement of the ray is approximately 1.54 cm."
