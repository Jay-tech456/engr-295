    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from various sources, both inside and outside our galaxy. The primary sources of cosmic rays include:\n\n1. Supernovae: When massive stars reach the end of their life cycle, they explode in a supernova, releasing vast amounts of energy and particles into space. These explosions are believed to be the primary source of cosmic rays with energies below the \"knee\" (around 10^15 electron volts).\n\n2. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): The supermassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies, known as AGN, can accelerate particles to extremely high energies. These particles can escape the galaxy and contribute to the cosmic ray flux.\n\n3. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): These are extremely energetic explosions that occur in distant galaxies, believed to be associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. GRBs can also produce high-energy cosmic rays.\n\n4. Pulsars: Rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, can generate strong magnetic fields that can accelerate particles to high energies, contributing to the cosmic ray flux.\n\n5. Solar flares: Our Sun also produces cosmic rays during solar flares, but these particles have much lower energies compared to those from other sources.\n\nThe impact of cosmic rays on the evolution of life in the universe, specifically on Earth's biosphere, is complex and multifaceted. Some of the potential effects include:\n\n1. Mutation: Cosmic rays can cause damage to DNA molecules, leading to mutations in living organisms. This can have both positive and negative effects on the evolution of life, as mutations can lead to new adaptations and increased diversity, but can also be harmful or lethal.\n\n2. Atmospheric changes: Cosmic rays can interact with Earth's atmosphere, producing secondary particles and leading to the formation of nitrogen oxides, which can affect the ozone layer. A thinner ozone layer allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach Earth's surface, which can have detrimental effects on life.\n\n3. Climate change: Cosmic rays have been hypothesized to influence cloud formation, which could potentially affect Earth's climate. However, the exact role of cosmic rays in climate change remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.\n\n4. Space travel: Cosmic rays pose a significant risk to astronauts and spacecraft during long-duration space missions. Exposure to high levels of cosmic radiation can increase the risk of cancer and other health issues for astronauts, as well as damage electronic equipment on spacecraft.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays originate from various sources, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and solar flares. Their impact on the evolution of life in the universe, particularly on Earth's biosphere, is complex and can include effects on mutation rates, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and space travel."
