    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the distance between the maxima on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (m * 位 * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance from the central maximum to the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum, 位 is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\ny = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converting to meters)\nm = 5 (5th order maximum)\n位 = 600 nm = 6 x 10^-7 m (converting to meters)\nL = 1 m\n\nWe need to find the value of d. Rearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (m * 位 * L) / y\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nd = (5 * 6 x 10^-7 m * 1 m) / 0.05 m\n\nd = (30 x 10^-7 m) / 0.05 m\n\nd = 6 x 10^-6 m / 0.05\n\nd = 1.2 x 10^-4 m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit experiment is 1.2 x 10^-4 meters or 0.12 mm."
