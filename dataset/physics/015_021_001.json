    "message_2": "Gravitational waves from a black hole accretion disk can be described using the quadrupole formula, which is a good approximation for weak gravitational waves. The waveform of gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk can be expressed as:\n\nh(t) = (G/c^4) * (d^2Q_ij/dt^2) * (1/R)\n\nwhere h(t) is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, Q_ij is the quadrupole moment tensor of the mass distribution, R is the distance from the source to the observer, and t is the time.\n\nThe quadrupole moment tensor Q_ij can be expressed as:\n\nQ_ij = ∫ρ(x) * (x_i * x_j - (1/3) * δ_ij * r^2) d^3x\n\nwhere ρ(x) is the mass density of the accretion disk, x_i and x_j are the Cartesian coordinates, δ_ij is the Kronecker delta, and r is the distance from the center of mass.\n\nThe mass of the black hole (M) and the angular momentum of the accretion disk (J) will affect the mass density distribution ρ(x) and the dynamics of the accretion disk. The exact dependence of the waveform on M and J is complex and requires numerical simulations to obtain accurate results.\n\nIn general, a more massive black hole will lead to stronger gravitational waves, while the angular momentum of the accretion disk will affect the shape of the waveform and the frequency of the emitted waves. The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the matter in the accretion disk, which depends on the mass of the black hole and the angular momentum of the disk."
