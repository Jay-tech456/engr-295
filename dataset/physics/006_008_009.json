    "message_2": "To find the maximum wavelength of radiation that can cause the photoelectric effect in cesium atoms, we can use the equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nThe work function of cesium is given as 1.95 eV. We need to convert this value to joules:\n\n1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J\n\n1.95 eV = 1.95 * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.12 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can use the energy equation to find the maximum wavelength:\n\n3.12 x 10^-19 J = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / λ\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.12 x 10^-19 J)\n\nλ = 6.36 x 10^-7 m\n\nSince we typically express wavelengths in nanometers (nm), we can convert this value:\n\nλ = 6.36 x 10^-7 m * (10^9 nm/m) = 636 nm\n\nSo, the maximum wavelength of radiation that can cause the photoelectric effect in cesium atoms is approximately 636 nm."
