    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the coaxial cable, where $r>R$, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space $\\mu_0$ and the total current enclosed by the loop, i.e.,\n\n$$\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$$\n\nWe will consider a circular Amperian loop of radius $r$ centered on the axis of the coaxial cable. Since the magnetic field is radially symmetric, it will be tangent to the Amperian loop at every point. Thus, the dot product $\\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l}$ will be simply $B dl$. The left-hand side of Ampere's Law becomes\n\n$$\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = B \\oint dl = B(2\\pi r)$$\n\nSince the radius of the coaxial cable is $R$, and we are considering a point at a distance $r>R$, the total current enclosed by the Amperian loop is equal to the current $I$ passing through the center of the cable. Therefore, $I_{enc} = I$. Now, we can apply Ampere's Law:\n\n$$B(2\\pi r) = \\mu_0 I$$\n\nSolving for the magnetic field $B$, we get\n\n$$B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$$\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the coaxial cable, where $r>R$, is given by\n\n$$B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$$"
