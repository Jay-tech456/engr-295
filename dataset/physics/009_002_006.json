    "message_1": "A student is studying Snell's Law and wants to determine the refractive index of a material. The student prepares a setup with a glass block and an incident ray of light. The angle of incidence is measured to be 45 degrees and the angle of refraction is measured to be 30 degrees. What is the refractive index of the glass block?",
    "message_2": "To determine the refractive index of the glass block, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two materials (air and glass in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nAssuming the incident ray is in air, the refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1. The angle of incidence (θ1) is 45 degrees, and the angle of refraction (θ2) is 30 degrees.\n\nWe can now solve for the refractive index of the glass block (n2):\n\n1 * sin(45) = n2 * sin(30)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071 and sin(30) = 0.5\n\n0.7071 = n2 * 0.5\n\nTo find n2, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\nn2 = 0.7071 / 0.5\nn2 ≈ 1.414\n\nThe refractive index of the glass block is approximately 1.414."
