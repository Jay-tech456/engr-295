    "message_2": "The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, θ1 is the angle of incidence (the critical angle), and θ2 is the angle of refraction (90 degrees in this case).\n\nFor a diamond surrounded by air, n1 = 2.42 (refractive index of diamond) and n2 = 1 (refractive index of air). We can rearrange Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°) / 2.42\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 2.42\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(sin(θ1))\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 2.42)\n\nθ1 ≈ 24.4°\n\nSo, the critical angle of a diamond with a refractive index of 2.42 when it is surrounded by air is approximately 24.4 degrees."
