    "message_2": "The force required for the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis is generated by the mitotic spindle, a structure composed of microtubules that attach to the kinetochores on the chromatids. The exact force required for this separation is not well-defined, as it depends on various factors such as the cell type, the number of microtubules involved, and the specific stage of mitosis. However, it has been estimated that the force exerted by a single microtubule on a kinetochore ranges from 1 to 7 piconewtons (pN).\n\nAs for the effect of temperature on this force, it is known that temperature can influence the dynamics of microtubules and their associated proteins. Higher temperatures can increase the rate of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, which may affect the force exerted on the chromatids. Additionally, temperature can affect the activity of motor proteins, such as dynein and kinesin, which are involved in generating the force for chromatid separation.\n\nHowever, the relationship between temperature and the force required for chromatid separation is not straightforward, as it depends on the specific cellular context and the interplay between various factors. In general, cells have evolved to function optimally at their physiological temperature, and deviations from this temperature may lead to alterations in the force exerted on chromatids during mitosis. Further research is needed to better understand the precise relationship between temperature and the force required for sister chromatid separation."
