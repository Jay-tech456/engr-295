    "message_2": "To determine the expected frequency distribution of gravitational waves emitted by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with different masses and merger rates, we need to consider several factors, including the mass distribution of PBHs, their merger rates, and the gravitational wave emission during their mergers.\n\n1. Mass distribution of PBHs: The mass distribution of PBHs can be described by a function, such as a power-law or log-normal distribution. This function will determine the relative number of PBHs with different masses. The mass distribution of PBHs is still uncertain and depends on the specific inflationary model and the formation mechanism of PBHs.\n\n2. Merger rates of PBHs: The merger rate of PBHs depends on their mass, density, and the clustering properties of PBHs. The merger rate can be estimated using N-body simulations or semi-analytical models that take into account the dynamical evolution of PBHs in the early universe and their interactions with other PBHs and surrounding matter.\n\n3. Gravitational wave emission during mergers: The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the merger of two PBHs depend on their masses and the distance to the observer. The frequency of the emitted gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the merging PBHs, which is determined by their masses and separation. The amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the PBHs and their distance from the observer.\n\nConsidering these factors, the expected frequency distribution of gravitational waves emitted by a population of PBHs can be calculated by integrating the product of the mass distribution, merger rates, and gravitational wave emission over the mass range and merger history of PBHs.\n\nTo optimize the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors towards detecting these waves from PBHs, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Broaden the frequency range: Since the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by PBHs depends on their masses, having detectors that cover a broad frequency range increases the chances of detecting waves from PBHs with different masses. Ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to frequencies between ~10 Hz and several kHz, while space-based detectors like LISA will be sensitive to lower frequencies, between ~10^(-4) Hz and 1 Hz.\n\n2. Improve the sensitivity at low frequencies: PBHs with lower masses emit gravitational waves at lower frequencies. Therefore, improving the sensitivity of detectors at low frequencies will increase the chances of detecting gravitational waves from PBHs with smaller masses. This can be achieved by using space-based detectors like LISA, which are less affected by seismic noise and can detect lower-frequency gravitational waves.\n\n3. Increase the observation time: The longer the observation time, the higher the chances of detecting rare events like PBH mergers. Increasing the observation time can be achieved by improving the stability and reliability of detectors and extending their operational lifetimes.\n\n4. Collaborate with other detectors: Combining data from multiple detectors can improve the sensitivity and localization of gravitational wave sources. This can be achieved through international collaborations between different gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA.\n\n5. Develop new detection techniques: Developing new data analysis techniques and algorithms can help improve the sensitivity of detectors and the identification of gravitational wave signals from PBHs. This includes machine learning techniques, matched filtering, and Bayesian inference methods.\n\nBy considering these strategies, the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors can be optimized towards detecting gravitational waves emitted by PBHs with different masses and merger rates."
