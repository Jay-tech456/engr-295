    "message_2": "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the latest measured mass of the top quark using data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is approximately 172.76 GeV/cÂ². This value is obtained from a combination of measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Please note that this value may change as more data is collected and analyzed, so it is always a good idea to check the latest publications and results from the LHC experiments for the most up-to-date information."
