    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a free particle with mass m and energy E is given by the Klein-Gordon equation. The Klein-Gordon equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the behavior of scalar fields (and, in some cases, spin-0 particles) in relativistic quantum mechanics. The equation is as follows:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (mc/ħ)²)ψ(x, t) = 0\n\nwhere\nψ(x, t) is the wave function of the particle,\n∂²/∂t² is the second-order time derivative,\n∇² is the Laplacian operator (second-order spatial derivative),\nm is the mass of the particle,\nc is the speed of light, and\nħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-relativistic limit. In this limit, the particle's kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy (mc²). We can express the energy E of the particle as:\n\nE = mc² + K\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy. In the non-relativistic limit, K << mc², so we can approximate E ≈ mc².\n\nWe can rewrite the Klein-Gordon equation in terms of the energy E:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (E/ħc)²)ψ(x, t) = 0\n\nNow, we can take the non-relativistic limit by considering the slowly varying wave function ψ(x, t) = φ(x, t) * exp(-iEt/ħ), where φ(x, t) is a slowly varying function of space and time. Substituting this into the modified Klein-Gordon equation and keeping only the leading-order terms, we get:\n\n(-iħ∂/∂t - ħ²/2m * ∇²)φ(x, t) = 0\n\nThis is the Schrödinger equation for a free particle in the non-relativistic limit:\n\niħ(∂/∂t)φ(x, t) = - (ħ²/2m) * ∇²φ(x, t)\n\nSo, the relativistic wave equation (Klein-Gordon equation) reduces to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit."
