    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a constant speed of 0.8c to a distant planet located 10 light-years away from Earth. According to General relativity, how much time elapses on the spaceship during the journey, and how much time elapses on Earth? (assume Earth and the spaceship are at rest relative to each other)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time elapsed in the moving frame (spaceship), Δt is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (Earth), v is the relative velocity between the two frames, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time elapsed on Earth (Δt). Since the spaceship is traveling at 0.8c and the distance to the planet is 10 light-years, we can calculate the time it takes for the spaceship to reach the planet as observed from Earth:\n\nΔt = distance / speed = 10 light-years / 0.8c = 12.5 years\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation equation to find the time elapsed on the spaceship (Δt'):\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²) = 12.5 years / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\n\nΔt' = 12.5 years / √(1 - 0.64) = 12.5 years / √(0.36)\n\nΔt' = 12.5 years / 0.6 = 20.83 years\n\nSo, during the journey, 12.5 years elapse on Earth, and 20.83 years elapse on the spaceship."
