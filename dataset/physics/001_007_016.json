    "message_2": "The expectation value of the energy for a quantum harmonic oscillator in the ground state can be found using the energy eigenvalues for the quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state, 1 for the first excited state, and so on), ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFor the ground state (n = 0), the expectation value of the energy is:\n\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2)ħω = (1/2)ħω\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 1), the expectation value of the energy is:\n\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω\n\nComparing the energies of the ground state and the first excited state, we see that the energy of the first excited state is higher than that of the ground state by an amount equal to ħω:\n\nE_1 - E_0 = (3/2)ħω - (1/2)ħω = ħω\n\nSo, the energy of the first excited state is ħω greater than the energy of the ground state."
