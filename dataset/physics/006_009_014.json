    "message_2": "To calculate the change in the wavelength of a photon after undergoing Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven the scattering angle θ = 30 degrees, we first need to convert it to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/6))\nΔλ ≈ (2.426 x 10^-12 m) * (1 - cos(π/6))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\ncos(π/6) ≈ 0.866\n1 - cos(π/6) ≈ 0.134\n\nNow, multiply this value by the Compton wavelength:\n\nΔλ ≈ (2.426 x 10^-12 m) * 0.134\nΔλ ≈ 3.25 x 10^-13 m\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of the photon after undergoing Compton scattering in a hydrogen atom is approximately 3.25 x 10^-13 meters."
