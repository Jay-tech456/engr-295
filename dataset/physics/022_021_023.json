    "message_2": "There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies are rotating faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, as predicted by general relativity, has been observed in many instances. In some cases, the amount of lensing is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass of the object. This additional lensing can be explained by the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational glue to help form these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide strong evidence for dark matter. Observations of the cluster show that the majority of the mass (as determined by gravitational lensing) is separated from the visible mass (gas and stars). This separation can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which does not interact with normal matter except through gravity.\n\nAs for ruling out the possibility that dark matter is composed of extra-dimensional particles, it is challenging to definitively rule out any specific dark matter candidate. However, most dark matter models focus on particles that exist within our known dimensions and have specific properties, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions.\n\nExtra-dimensional particles, such as those predicted by string theory or other higher-dimensional theories, could potentially contribute to the dark matter content of the universe. However, these theories often involve complex and speculative physics that have not yet been tested or confirmed through experiments. Additionally, many extra-dimensional models do not provide a clear mechanism for how these particles would interact with normal matter or produce the observed effects attributed to dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while it is difficult to completely rule out the possibility that dark matter is composed of extra-dimensional particles, the current evidence and theoretical models favor dark matter candidates that exist within our known dimensions and have specific properties that can explain the observed phenomena."
