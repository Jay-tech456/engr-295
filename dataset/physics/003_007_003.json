    "message_1": "A current-carrying rod of length 0.5 meters and current 2.5 A is placed parallel to the x-axis at a distance of 0.2 meters from it. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point on the y-axis located 0.3 meters from the origin, due to this rod?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the y-axis due to the current-carrying rod, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the current-carrying rod, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is parallel to the x-axis, we can integrate along the x-axis from 0 to 0.5 meters. The point P is located at (0, 0.3) meters. Let's denote x as the position along the rod, then the position vector r is given by:\n\nr = (x, -0.2) meters\n\nThe differential length vector dl is given by:\n\ndl = (dx, 0) meters\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (0, 0, -0.2dx)\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + (-0.2)^2)\n\nNow, we can plug everything into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2.5 * (-0.2dx)) / (x^2 + 0.04)^3/2\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB along the x-axis from 0 to 0.5 meters:\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to 0.5\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 4π) * ∫(dx / (x^2 + 0.04)^3/2) from 0 to 0.5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2 + 0.04, then du = 2xdx:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 4π) * ∫(du / (2u^3/2)) from u(0) to u(0.5)\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 8π) * ∫(u^(-3/2)du) from 0.04 to 0.29\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 8π) * [(-2/3) * u^(1/2)] from 0.04 to 0.29\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 12π) * [(-2/3) * (0.29^(1/2) - 0.04^(1/2))]\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of μ₀:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 * (-0.2) / 12π) * [(-2/3) * (0.29^(1/2) - 0.04^(1/2))]\n\nB ≈ -1.67 × 10^(-7) * (-0.34) T\n\nB ≈ 5.67 × 10^(-8) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 5.67 × 10^(-8) T. Since the magnetic field is in the negative z-direction, it is pointing into the plane (using the right-hand rule)."
