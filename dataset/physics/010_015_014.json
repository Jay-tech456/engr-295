    "message_1": "A propeller operates inside a water tank at a rotational speed of 1200 RPM. The tank pressure is adjusted to 10 atm with a pump. The propeller blade cavitation begins at an angle of attack of 15 degrees. Determine the minimum pressure required in the water tank to avoid cavitation.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum pressure required in the water tank to avoid cavitation, we need to consider the pressure distribution around the propeller blade at the given angle of attack. The pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side of the blade should not fall below the vapor pressure of the water to avoid cavitation.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given information into SI units:\n\nRotational speed: 1200 RPM = 1200/60 = 20 revolutions per second (rps)\nTank pressure: 10 atm = 10 * 101325 Pa = 1013250 Pa\n\nNow, let's calculate the pressure difference (ΔP) around the propeller blade at the angle of attack of 15 degrees. We can use the Bernoulli's equation to estimate the pressure difference:\n\nΔP = 0.5 * ρ * (V² - U²)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of water, V is the velocity of the flow on the suction side of the blade, and U is the velocity of the flow on the pressure side of the blade.\n\nThe density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³. To find the velocities V and U, we need to know the flow speed around the blade. This can be estimated using the rotational speed and the blade's chord length (c) and radius (r):\n\nFlow speed = 2 * π * r * rotational speed\n\nAssuming a chord length (c) of 0.1 m and a radius (r) of 0.5 m, the flow speed is:\n\nFlow speed = 2 * π * 0.5 m * 20 rps ≈ 62.83 m/s\n\nNow, we can estimate the velocities V and U using the angle of attack (α) and the lift coefficient (Cl):\n\nV = flow speed * (1 + Cl * α / (2 * π))\nU = flow speed * (1 - Cl * α / (2 * π))\n\nAssuming a lift coefficient (Cl) of 1.0 for the propeller blade, the velocities V and U are:\n\nV ≈ 62.83 m/s * (1 + 1.0 * 15° / (2 * π)) ≈ 67.39 m/s\nU ≈ 62.83 m/s * (1 - 1.0 * 15° / (2 * π)) ≈ 58.27 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure difference (ΔP) using the Bernoulli's equation:\n\nΔP = 0.5 * 1000 kg/m³ * (67.39² - 58.27²) ≈ 1.61 * 10^6 Pa\n\nTo avoid cavitation, the pressure difference (ΔP) should not fall below the vapor pressure of the water. The vapor pressure of water at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 3200 Pa. Therefore, the minimum pressure required in the water tank to avoid cavitation is:\n\nMinimum pressure = tank pressure + ΔP - vapor pressure\nMinimum pressure = 1013250 Pa + 1.61 * 10^6 Pa - 3200 Pa ≈ 2.72 * 10^6 Pa\n\nSo, the minimum pressure required in the water tank to avoid cavitation is approximately 2.72 * 10^6 Pa or 26.9 atm."
