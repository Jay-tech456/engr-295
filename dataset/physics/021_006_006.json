    "message_2": "The gravitational forces exerted by a black hole have a significant impact on the orbital motion of nearby stars and planets. The strong gravitational pull of a black hole can cause nearby celestial objects to experience changes in their trajectory, velocity, and acceleration over time. Here's a detailed explanation of these changes:\n\n1. Trajectory: The trajectory of a star or planet is the path it follows as it moves through space. When a celestial object comes close to a black hole, the intense gravitational force can cause the object's trajectory to bend or warp. In some cases, the object may be captured by the black hole and begin to orbit around it. The trajectory of the object will be determined by its initial velocity, distance from the black hole, and the mass of the black hole. If the object passes close enough to the black hole, it may experience a phenomenon called gravitational slingshot, where it gains velocity and is flung out into space along a different trajectory.\n\n2. Velocity: The velocity of a celestial object is its speed and direction of motion. As an object approaches a black hole, the gravitational force acting on it increases, causing it to accelerate towards the black hole. This acceleration results in an increase in the object's velocity. If the object is captured by the black hole and begins to orbit around it, its velocity will be determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it towards the black hole and its centripetal force, which keeps it in orbit. The closer the object is to the black hole, the higher its orbital velocity will be.\n\n3. Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object. When a celestial object is influenced by the gravitational force of a black hole, it experiences an acceleration towards the black hole. The acceleration depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the object and the black hole, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation. As the object gets closer to the black hole, the gravitational force increases, and so does the acceleration. This causes the object to move faster and faster towards the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational forces exerted by a black hole can significantly alter the trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of nearby stars and planets. The specific changes depend on factors such as the mass of the black hole, the distance between the celestial object and the black hole, and the initial velocity of the object. These changes can result in objects being captured by the black hole, flung out into space, or experiencing extreme changes in their motion."
