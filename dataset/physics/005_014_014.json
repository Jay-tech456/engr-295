Given that the resulting electron is emitted at 0.997c with respect to the lab frame. (Assume the muon was initially at rest in the lab frame)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the decay energy of a muon at rest, we first need to find the total energy of the muon before decay and the total energy of the decay products after the decay. Then, we can find the difference between these two energies to get the decay energy.\n\n1. Total energy of the muon before decay:\nSince the muon is at rest, its total energy is equal to its rest mass energy. Using the mass-energy equivalence formula, E = mc², where m is the rest mass and c is the speed of light:\n\nE_muon = (105.7 MeV/c²)(c²) = 105.7 MeV\n\n2. Total energy of the decay products after decay:\nThe muon decays into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV/c² and is emitted at a speed of 0.997c. The muon neutrino and electron antineutrino are both massless, so their energy is purely kinetic.\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic mass of the electron using the Lorentz factor, γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.997c)²/c²) ≈ 15.08\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass of the electron:\n\nm_electron_relativistic = γ * m_electron = 15.08 * 0.511 MeV/c² ≈ 7.70 MeV/c²\n\nNext, we can find the total energy of the electron using the mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE_electron = m_electron_relativistic * c² = 7.70 MeV\n\nSince the muon neutrino and electron antineutrino are massless, their energy is purely kinetic, and we can assume that their combined energy is equal to the difference between the initial muon energy and the final electron energy:\n\nE_neutrinos = E_muon - E_electron = 105.7 MeV - 7.70 MeV = 98 MeV\n\n3. Decay energy of the muon:\nThe decay energy is the difference between the total energy of the muon before decay and the total energy of the decay products after decay:\n\nDecay_energy = E_muon - (E_electron + E_neutrinos) = 105.7 MeV - (7.70 MeV + 98 MeV) = 0 MeV\n\nThe decay energy of the muon at rest is 0 MeV. This result is expected because the muon decay is a three-body decay, and the energy is conserved in the process. The total energy of the muon before decay is equal to the total energy of the decay products after decay."
