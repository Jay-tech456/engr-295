    "message_1": "A heat engine is operating between two temperatures of 500 K and 300 K. Calculate the maximum efficiency of the engine using Carnot's cycle.",
    "message_2": "The maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between two temperatures can be determined using the Carnot efficiency formula:\n\nEfficiency (η) = 1 - (Tc/Th)\n\nwhere η is the efficiency, Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir (in Kelvin), and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir (in Kelvin).\n\nIn this case, Tc = 300 K and Th = 500 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nEfficiency (η) = 1 - (300 K / 500 K) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the maximum efficiency of the heat engine operating between these two temperatures using Carnot's cycle is 40%."
