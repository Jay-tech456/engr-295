    "message_2": "To calculate the chromatic aberration of the lens, we need to find the difference in focal lengths for the two different colors (blue and red) of light.\n\nWe can use the lens maker's formula to find the focal lengths for each color:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nWhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since we are given the overall focal length (20 cm) and the refractive indices for blue and red light, we can rearrange the formula to find the difference in radii of curvature for the two colors:\n\n1/f_blue = (1.5-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n1/f_red = (1.6-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the focal lengths for blue and red light:\n\nf_blue = 20 cm / (1.5 - 1) = 40 cm\nf_red = 20 cm / (1.6 - 1) = 33.33 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the chromatic aberration by finding the difference in focal lengths:\n\nChromatic aberration = |f_blue - f_red| = |40 cm - 33.33 cm| = 6.67 cm\n\nSo, the chromatic aberration of the lens is 6.67 cm."
