    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observed gravitational lensing of a galaxy cluster. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light coming from a more distant object, such as another galaxy, due to its gravitational influence. This bending of light causes the distant object to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter, an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light but has a significant gravitational influence, is believed to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe. Galaxy clusters are known to contain large amounts of dark matter, which contributes to their overall mass. The presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster enhances the gravitational lensing effect, making it more pronounced than it would be if only the visible matter were present.\n\nBy studying the gravitational lensing effects around galaxy clusters, we can infer the distribution and properties of the dark matter within them. The degree of distortion, magnification, and the arrangement of the lensed images provide valuable information about the mass distribution of the lensing object, including the dark matter component.\n\nAstronomers use various techniques to analyze the gravitational lensing effects, such as strong lensing (which produces multiple images and highly distorted arcs) and weak lensing (which causes more subtle distortions in the shapes of background galaxies). By comparing the observed lensing effects with theoretical models, researchers can estimate the amount and distribution of dark matter in the galaxy cluster.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster enhances the observed gravitational lensing effects, and by studying these effects, we can infer the distribution and properties of the dark matter within the cluster. This information helps us better understand the nature of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures."
