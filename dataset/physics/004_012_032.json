    "message_2": "In a matter-dominated, flat universe, the Friedmann equation can be written as:\n\nH^2 = (8πG/3)ρ_m\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, and ρ_m is the matter density.\n\nThe matter density can be expressed in terms of the critical density (ρ_c) and the matter density parameter (Ω_m):\n\nρ_m = Ω_m * ρ_c\n\nIn a flat universe, Ω_m = 1. The critical density can be written as:\n\nρ_c = 3H_0^2 / (8πG)\n\nwhere H_0 is the Hubble constant at the present time.\n\nNow, we can write the Friedmann equation as:\n\nH^2 = (8πG/3) * Ω_m * ρ_c = H_0^2\n\nIn a matter-dominated universe, the scale factor (a) is related to the Hubble parameter (H) and the Hubble constant (H_0) as follows:\n\nH(a) = H_0 * a^(-3/2)\n\nGiven a scale factor of 0.5, we can find the Hubble parameter:\n\nH = H_0 * (0.5)^(-3/2)\n\nH = H_0 * (1/√(0.5))^3\n\nH = H_0 * (1/0.5^1.5)\n\nH = H_0 * (1/0.35355)\n\nH = 2.82843 * H_0\n\nSo, the Hubble parameter for a universe with a scale factor of 0.5, assuming a flat cosmology and a matter-dominated universe, is approximately 2.82843 times the Hubble constant at the present time."
