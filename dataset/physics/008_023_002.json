    "message_2": "To determine the production rates, branching ratios, and polarization properties of W and Z bosons in electron-positron collisions with different center-of-mass energies, we need to consider the relevant processes and their cross-sections. Here, I will provide a general overview of these properties.\n\n1. Production rates:\nThe production rates of W and Z bosons in electron-positron collisions depend on the center-of-mass energy (√s) and the electroweak coupling constants. The production cross-sections can be calculated using the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nFor W boson pair production (e+e- → W+W-), the cross-section increases with the center-of-mass energy and reaches a maximum around the threshold energy of 2 * m_W (where m_W is the mass of the W boson). Above this threshold, the cross-section decreases as the energy increases.\n\nFor Z boson production (e+e- → Z), the cross-section has a resonant peak at the center-of-mass energy equal to the mass of the Z boson (m_Z). This is known as the Z-pole, and the production rate is significantly higher at this energy.\n\n2. Branching ratios:\nThe branching ratios of W and Z bosons are determined by the decay modes of these particles. The W boson can decay into a lepton and a neutrino (W → lν) or a quark-antiquark pair (W → q'q). The branching ratio for each decay mode is roughly:\n\n- W → lν: 10.8% for each lepton family (e, μ, τ)\n- W → q'q: 67.6% (sum of all quark-antiquark pairs)\n\nThe Z boson can decay into a lepton-antilepton pair (Z → ll), a neutrino-antineutrino pair (Z → νν), or a quark-antiquark pair (Z → qq). The branching ratios for each decay mode are approximately:\n\n- Z → ll: 3.37% for each lepton family (e, μ, τ)\n- Z → νν: 20.0% (sum of all neutrino families)\n- Z → qq: 69.9% (sum of all quark-antiquark pairs)\n\n3. Polarization properties:\nThe polarization properties of W and Z bosons in electron-positron collisions depend on the helicity of the initial state particles and the production mechanism. In general, the polarization of the W and Z bosons can be determined by analyzing the angular distributions of their decay products.\n\nFor W boson pair production, the polarization of the W bosons is affected by the helicity of the initial state electrons and positrons. The angular distribution of the decay products can provide information about the polarization of the W bosons.\n\nFor Z boson production, the polarization of the Z boson depends on the initial state electron and positron helicities. The angular distribution of the decay products can be used to determine the polarization of the Z boson.\n\nIn summary, the production rates, branching ratios, and polarization properties of W and Z bosons in electron-positron collisions depend on the center-of-mass energy and the electroweak couplings. Detailed calculations using the Standard Model of particle physics can provide more precise values for these properties at specific energies."
