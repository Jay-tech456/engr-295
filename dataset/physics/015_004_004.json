    "message_1": "What is the total energy that can be expected to be emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a known mass and distance from Earth? Using the equations related to gravitational wave energy, and assuming certain parameters about the supernova, calculate the expected energy emitted in gravitational waves during the event.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the total energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE_GW = (G/c^5) * k * M^2 * R\n\nwhere:\n- E_GW is the energy emitted in gravitational waves\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- k is a dimensionless constant that depends on the specific properties of the supernova (typically in the range of 0.001 to 0.1)\n- M is the mass of the supernova (in kg)\n- R is the distance from the center of the supernova to the point where the gravitational waves are emitted (in meters)\n\nAssuming we know the mass (M) and distance (R) of the supernova, we can plug these values into the equation to calculate the expected energy emitted in gravitational waves during the event.\n\nPlease provide the mass and distance of the supernova, as well as any specific information about the supernova that might help determine the value of k."
