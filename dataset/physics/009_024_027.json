    "message_1": "What is the intensity of light that passes through two polarizers whose axes are oriented at an angle of 60 degrees to each other if the intensity of unpolarized light incident on the first polarizer is 10 mW/cm²?",
    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by half. So after passing through the first polarizer, the intensity of the light will be:\n\nI1 = (1/2) * I0 = (1/2) * 10 mW/cm² = 5 mW/cm²\n\nNow, the light is polarized and passes through the second polarizer, which is oriented at an angle of 60 degrees to the first one. The intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer can be calculated using Malus's Law:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I2 is the intensity after passing through the second polarizer, I1 is the intensity after passing through the first polarizer, and θ is the angle between the axes of the two polarizers.\n\nI2 = 5 mW/cm² * cos²(60°) = 5 mW/cm² * (1/2) = 2.5 mW/cm²\n\nSo the intensity of light that passes through both polarizers is 2.5 mW/cm²."
