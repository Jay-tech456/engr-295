    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid that is equidistant from the two circular faces, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nIn this case, the toroidal solenoid has N = 1000 turns, a mean radius R = 10 cm = 0.1 m, and a cross-sectional radius of 1 cm = 0.01 m. The current passing through the solenoid is I = 2 A.\n\nThe magnetic field inside the toroid is uniform and parallel to the circular path with a radius r, where r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point of interest. Since the point is equidistant from the two circular faces, r = R + 0.5 * cross-sectional radius = 0.1 m + 0.5 * 0.01 m = 0.105 m.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we have:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the circular path, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the current enclosed by the circular path. The total current passing through the solenoid is I = 2 A, and since there are N = 1000 turns, the current enclosed by the circular path is I_enclosed = N * I = 1000 * 2 A = 2000 A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 A) / (2π * 0.105 m)\nB ≈ 0.012 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point inside the toroid that is equidistant from the two circular faces is approximately 0.012 T (tesla)."
