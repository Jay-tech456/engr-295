    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the particle, we can use the formula:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm_0 = 2 grams = 0.002 kg (converting to SI units)\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v in m/s:\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = 0.002 / sqrt(1 - (2.4 x 10^8)^2 / (3 x 10^8)^2)\nm_rel ≈ 0.002 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm_rel ≈ 0.002 / sqrt(0.36)\nm_rel ≈ 0.002 / 0.6\nm_rel ≈ 0.003333 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass is approximately 0.003333 kg or 3.333 grams.\n\nTo find the increase in mass due to relativistic effects, we can subtract the rest mass from the relativistic mass:\n\nΔm = m_rel - m_0\nΔm = 0.003333 kg - 0.002 kg\nΔm = 0.001333 kg\n\nThe increase in mass due to relativistic effects is approximately 0.001333 kg or 1.333 grams."
