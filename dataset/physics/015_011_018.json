    "message_2": "The number of gravitational wave detections per year that can be estimated by future observatories depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the volume of space they can observe, and the frequency of events that produce detectable gravitational waves.\n\nCurrently, the primary gravitational wave observatories are the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the United States and the Virgo observatory in Italy. These observatories have detected gravitational waves from dozens of events, primarily binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers, since the first detection in 2015.\n\nFuture observatories, such as the planned LIGO-India and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), aim to improve the sensitivity and range of gravitational wave detection. With these advancements, it is expected that the rate of detections will increase significantly.\n\nBased on current models and technology, it is difficult to provide a precise number of detections per year, as the estimates can vary widely depending on the assumptions made. However, some estimates suggest that advanced ground-based detectors like the upgraded LIGO and Virgo could detect up to a few hundred events per year. The space-based LISA, which is expected to be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, could potentially detect thousands of events over its multi-year mission.\n\nIt is important to note that these estimates are subject to uncertainties in the underlying astrophysical models and the actual performance of the detectors. As our understanding of gravitational wave sources and detector technology improves, these estimates may be refined."
