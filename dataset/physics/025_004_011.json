    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (ΔG) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG° is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), and Q is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at any point in time.\n\nSince we are given the equilibrium constant (Keq), we can use the relationship between ΔG° and Keq:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(Keq)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for Q:\n\nln(Q) = (ΔG - ΔG°) / (-RT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nln(Q) = (-10 kJ/mol - (-10 kJ/mol)) / (-8.314 J/mol·K × 298 K)\n\nln(Q) = 0\n\nQ = e^0 = 1\n\nSince Q = 1, the reaction is at equilibrium, and the change in free energy (ΔG) is equal to the standard free energy change (ΔG°):\n\nΔG = -10 kJ/mol"
