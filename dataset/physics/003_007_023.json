The radius of the rod is negligible. (Assume the rod is infinitely thin and the current is uniformly distributed across the rod.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the rod, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r from the current element is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nSince the rod is straight and infinitely thin, we can consider it as a line current. Let's divide the rod into small segments of length dx. The magnetic field dB at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the rod due to a small segment dx can be calculated as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx * sinθ) / (x² + 10²)\n\nwhere x is the distance from the center of the rod to the small segment dx, and θ is the angle between the current element and the line connecting the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nSince the rod is straight, the angle θ is the same for all segments, and sinθ = 10 / sqrt(x² + 10²).\n\nNow, we need to integrate the magnetic field dB over the entire length of the rod (-15 cm to 15 cm) to find the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = ∫((-15, 15), (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * dx * 10) / (x² + 10²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 20 * ∫((-15, 15), dx / (x² + 10²)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of μ₀ and integrate:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * 20 * ∫((-15, 15), dx / (x² + 10²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 20 * ∫((-15, 15), dx / (x² + 10²)^(3/2))\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x² + 10², then du = 2x dx. The integral becomes:\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * ∫(((-15)² + 10², (15)² + 10²), du / u^(3/2))\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * [(-2 / sqrt(u))](((-15)² + 10², (15)² + 10²))\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * (-2 / sqrt((15)² + 10²) - (-2 / sqrt((-15)² + 10²)))\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * (-2 / sqrt(325) + 2 / sqrt(325))\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * (4 / sqrt(325))\n\nB ≈ 2.22 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the rod is approximately 2.22 × 10^(-7) T."
