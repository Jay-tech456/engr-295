    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, we can find the magnetic field due to one side and then multiply by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nConsider one side of the square loop. Let's say it is parallel to the x-axis and has a length of 2.0 cm (0.02 m). The center of the square loop is at a distance of half the side length (0.01 m) from the middle of this side.\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law along the length of the side. The magnetic field due to a small current element on this side is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sinθ) / r²\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r. In this case, θ = 90°, so sinθ = 1.\n\nIntegrating along the length of the side, we get:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl) / r²\n\nSince μ₀, I, and 4π are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫dl / r²\n\nThe limits of integration are from -0.01 m to 0.01 m (the length of the side). The distance r is the square root of the sum of the squares of the distance from the center to the middle of the side (0.01 m) and the distance along the side (x):\n\nr = √(0.01² + x²)\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫dl / (√(0.01² + x²))^2 from -0.01 to 0.01\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫dx / (0.01² + x²) from -0.01 to 0.01\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let x = 0.01 * tan(u), then dx = 0.01 * sec²(u) du:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫(0.01 * sec²(u) du) / (0.01² + (0.01 * tan(u))²)\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫(0.01 * sec²(u) du) / (0.01² * (1 + tan²(u)))\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫(0.01 * sec²(u) du) / (0.01² * sec²(u))\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫(0.01 du) / 0.01²\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * ∫du / 0.01 from u1 to u2\n\nwhere u1 = arctan(-1) and u2 = arctan(1).\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * (u2 - u1) / 0.01\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * (arctan(1) - arctan(-1)) / 0.01\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * (π/4 - (-π/4)) / 0.01\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * (π/2) / 0.01\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the square loop by multiplying the magnetic field due to one side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ * I) / (4π) * (π/2) / 0.01\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I) * (π/2) / 0.01\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀ and I:\n\nB_total = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2.5 A) * (π/2) / 0.01\n\nB_total ≈ 1.96 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 1.96 × 10^(-5) T."
