    "message_2": "The formula for the magnetic field intensity (B) at the center of a circular coil with a current (I) and radius (r) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A.\n\nGiven the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m and the current I = 5 A, we can calculate the magnetic field intensity:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.2\nB = 100π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at the center of the circular coil is approximately 100π × 10⁻⁷ T or 3.14 × 10⁻⁵ T."
