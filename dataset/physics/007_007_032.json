    "message_2": "The resonant frequency of a proton in a magnetic field can be calculated using the Larmor equation:\n\nf = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere f is the resonant frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of a proton is 2.67 x 10^8 rad/T*s and the magnetic field strength (B) is 1.5 Tesla, we can calculate the resonant frequency (f) as follows:\n\nf = (2.67 x 10^8 rad/T*s * 1.5 T) / (2 * π)\n\nf ≈ (4.005 x 10^8 rad/s) / (6.2832)\n\nf ≈ 6.38 x 10^7 Hz\n\nThe resonant frequency of a proton placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1.5 Tesla is approximately 63.8 MHz."
