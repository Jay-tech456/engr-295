    "message_2": "The Curie temperature (Tc) is a critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic or a ferrimagnetic material loses its spontaneous magnetization and becomes paramagnetic. The Curie temperature is a material property and depends on the exchange interactions between the magnetic moments of the atoms or ions in the material.\n\nIn general, the Curie temperature does not vary significantly with the external magnetic field strength for a given magnetic material. This is because the Curie temperature is mainly determined by the strength of the exchange interactions between the magnetic moments, which are intrinsic to the material and not significantly affected by the external magnetic field.\n\nHowever, there might be a slight increase in the Curie temperature with increasing magnetic field strength, but this effect is usually negligible compared to the intrinsic Curie temperature of the material. The reason for this slight increase is that the external magnetic field can enhance the alignment of the magnetic moments, making it more difficult for thermal fluctuations to randomize their orientations. But again, this effect is typically very small and can be ignored in most practical applications."
