    "message_2": "To estimate the minimum mass of a primordial black hole (PBH) that could account for the inferred abundance of dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the density of dark matter and the number of PBHs required to make up that density.\n\nThe density of dark matter in the universe is approximately 0.3 times the critical density, which is about 9.9 x 10^-27 kg/m^3. The total mass of dark matter in the observable universe is estimated to be around 2.5 x 10^52 kg.\n\nNow, let's assume that dark matter is entirely composed of primordial black holes. The minimum mass of a PBH should be large enough to have not evaporated due to Hawking radiation by now. The evaporation time (t) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nt ≈ (M^3) / (ħc^4)\n\nWhere M is the mass of the black hole, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. The age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, or 4.35 x 10^17 seconds. Setting the evaporation time equal to the age of the universe, we can solve for the minimum mass:\n\nM_min^3 ≈ (ħc^4) * 4.35 x 10^17 s\n\nM_min ≈ 2.2 x 10^22 kg\n\nSo, the minimum mass of a primordial black hole that could account for the inferred abundance of dark matter in the universe is approximately 2.2 x 10^22 kg. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and subject to change based on new observations and refinements in our understanding of dark matter and primordial black holes."
