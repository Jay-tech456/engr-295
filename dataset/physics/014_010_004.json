    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius, also known as the gravitational radius, is a characteristic radius associated with every mass where, if that mass could be compressed to fit within that radius, it would form a black hole. It is named after the German physicist Karl Schwarzschild, who first derived the concept in 1916. The Schwarzschild radius is the distance from the center of a non-rotating black hole to its event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass into kilograms. One solar mass (Ms) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 5Ms = 5 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 1.47 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14,700 meters or 14.7 kilometers."
