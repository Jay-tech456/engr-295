    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of the electron, we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron (0.99c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99^2)\nγ ≈ 7.0888\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (7.0888 - 1) * (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 6.0888 * (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 3.326 x 10^-14 J\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the electron just prior to colliding with a stationary proton is approximately 3.326 x 10^-14 Joules."
