    "message_2": "A uniformly charged sphere carrying a steady current is not a physically possible scenario, as a current requires a flow of charges, and a uniformly charged sphere has no flow of charges. However, I can provide you with the magnetic field due to a current loop or a solenoid, which are more realistic scenarios.\n\n1. Magnetic field due to a current loop:\nIf you have a circular loop of radius R carrying a current I, the magnetic field at the center of the loop can be calculated using Ampere's law. The magnetic field at the center of the loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\n2. Magnetic field due to a solenoid:\nA solenoid is a coil of wire wrapped around a cylinder, carrying a current I. The magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, n is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, and I is the current.\n\nPlease provide more information about the specific scenario you are interested in, and I can help you calculate the magnetic field accordingly."
