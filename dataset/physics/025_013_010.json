    "message_2": "The wavelength of light plays a crucial role in the perception of color by the human eye. The human eye contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light and converting it into electrical signals that the brain can interpret. There are two main types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light.\n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the human eye, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths of light. These cones are often referred to as short-wavelength (S), medium-wavelength (M), and long-wavelength (L) cones. The S-cones are most sensitive to blue light (around 420-440 nm), M-cones are most sensitive to green light (around 530-540 nm), and L-cones are most sensitive to red light (around 560-580 nm).\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it is absorbed by the photoreceptors, and the cones respond to the specific wavelengths of light that they are sensitive to. The brain then processes the signals from these cones to create the perception of color.\n\nThe wavelength of light directly affects the perception of color because different wavelengths correspond to different colors in the visible light spectrum. The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). When a specific wavelength of light is detected by the cones in the eye, it is perceived as a particular color. For example, light with a wavelength of 450 nm would be perceived as blue, while light with a wavelength of 650 nm would be perceived as red.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light affects the perception of color by the human eye because different wavelengths correspond to different colors in the visible light spectrum. The cone cells in the eye are sensitive to specific ranges of wavelengths, and the brain processes the signals from these cones to create the perception of color."
