    "message_2": "In a flat universe, the scale factor as a function of time depends on whether the universe is matter-dominated or radiation-dominated. Let's consider both cases:\n\n1. Matter-dominated universe:\nIn this case, the scale factor a(t) is proportional to t^(2/3). So, the equation for the scale factor is:\n\na(t) = A * t^(2/3)\n\nwhere A is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe Hubble parameter H(t) is the time derivative of the scale factor divided by the scale factor itself:\n\nH(t) = (2/3) * t^(-1/3)\n\nThe critical density ρ_c(t) is given by:\n\nρ_c(t) = (3 * H(t)^2) / (8 * π * G)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n2. Radiation-dominated universe:\nIn this case, the scale factor a(t) is proportional to t^(1/2). So, the equation for the scale factor is:\n\na(t) = B * t^(1/2)\n\nwhere B is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe Hubble parameter H(t) is the time derivative of the scale factor divided by the scale factor itself:\n\nH(t) = (1/2) * t^(-1/2)\n\nThe critical density ρ_c(t) is given by:\n\nρ_c(t) = (3 * H(t)^2) / (8 * π * G)\n\nIn both cases, the critical density decreases as the universe expands, and the Hubble parameter also decreases with time. The main difference between the matter-dominated and radiation-dominated cases is the power of t in the scale factor and Hubble parameter equations."
