    "message_2": "A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that uses small amounts of radioactive materials called radiotracers, such as fludeoxyglucose (FDG), to diagnose or treat various diseases. The radioactive dose received by a patient during a PET scan depends on the administered activity of the radiotracer and its effective dose coefficient.\n\nFor FDG-PET scans, the typical administered activity is around 370-555 MBq (megabecquerels) for adults. The effective dose coefficient for FDG is approximately 1.9 x 10^(-2) mSv/MBq. To calculate the average radioactive dose received by a patient, we can multiply the administered activity by the effective dose coefficient:\n\nDose (mSv) = Administered activity (MBq) x Effective dose coefficient (mSv/MBq)\n\nAssuming an administered activity of 370 MBq:\n\nDose (mSv) = 370 MBq x 1.9 x 10^(-2) mSv/MBq â‰ˆ 7.03 mSv\n\nSo, the average radioactive dose received by a patient undergoing an FDG-PET scan is approximately 7.03 millisieverts (mSv).\n\nNow, let's compare this to the dose received during a typical X-ray. The dose varies depending on the type of X-ray:\n\n- Chest X-ray: 0.1 mSv\n- Abdominal X-ray: 0.7 mSv\n- Lumbar spine X-ray: 1.5 mSv\n- Pelvis X-ray: 0.6 mSv\n\nAs we can see, the dose received during an FDG-PET scan is significantly higher than that of a typical X-ray. However, it's important to note that PET scans provide valuable functional information about tissues and organs, which can be crucial for diagnosing and treating various diseases. The benefits of undergoing a PET scan usually outweigh the risks associated with the radiation dose."
