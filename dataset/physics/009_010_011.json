    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, v is the image distance, and M is the magnification.\n\nGiven:\nf = 12 cm (concave mirror, so f is positive)\nu = -20 cm (object is in front of the mirror, so u is negative)\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/12 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying by 60v to eliminate fractions:\n\n5v = -3v + 60\n8v = 60\nv = 7.5 cm (positive value means the image is formed on the same side as the object)\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -7.5 / (-20)\nM = 0.375\n\nThe magnification is 0.375, which means the image is smaller than the object (since M < 1).\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image. Also, since the magnification (M) is positive, the image is upright.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnification of the mirror is 0.375, and the image formed is virtual, upright, and smaller than the object."
