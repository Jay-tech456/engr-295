    "message_2": "The scattering cross-section of thermal neutrons from a material with a random distribution of scatterers can be described by the following formula:\n\nσ = N * σ_s\n\nwhere σ is the total scattering cross-section, N is the number of scatterers per unit volume, and σ_s is the scattering cross-section of a single scatterer.\n\nThe scattering cross-section of a single scatterer, σ_s, depends on the atomic structure of the scatterers and their temperature. In general, the scattering cross-section can be expressed as:\n\nσ_s = (4π/λ^2) * |f|^2 * S(Q,ω)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the incident neutron, f is the scattering amplitude, Q is the momentum transfer, ω is the energy transfer, and S(Q,ω) is the dynamic structure factor.\n\nThe scattering amplitude, f, depends on the atomic structure of the scatterers. It is a complex quantity that takes into account the coherent and incoherent scattering processes. The coherent scattering amplitude is related to the atomic form factor, which depends on the atomic number and the electron distribution of the scatterer. The incoherent scattering amplitude is related to the isotopic composition of the scatterer.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor, S(Q,ω), depends on the temperature of the scatterers and their atomic structure. It is a measure of the probability of scattering with a given momentum transfer Q and energy transfer ω. At high temperatures, the dynamic structure factor is dominated by the thermal motion of the scatterers, which leads to a broadening of the scattering peaks. At low temperatures, the dynamic structure factor is dominated by the static atomic structure, which leads to sharp scattering peaks.\n\nIn summary, the scattering cross-section of thermal neutrons from a material with a random distribution of scatterers depends on the atomic structure of the scatterers and their temperature. The scattering cross-section is determined by the scattering amplitude, which depends on the atomic number and electron distribution of the scatterer, and the dynamic structure factor, which depends on the temperature and atomic structure of the scatterer."
