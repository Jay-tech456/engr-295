    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/meter), and I is the current (amperes).\n\nGiven the solenoid has 300 turns of wire per meter and a length of 50 centimeters (0.5 meters), we can calculate the number of turns per unit length (n) as follows:\n\nn = 300 turns/meter\n\nThe solenoid carries a current of 2 amperes (I = 2 A). Now, we can calculate the magnetic field (B) at the center of the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (300 turns/meter) * (2 A)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (600 A/m)\nB ≈ 7.54 × 10^(-4) T\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 7.54 × 10^(-4) T (tesla)."
