    "message_2": "To estimate the minimum energy released in the form of gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the supernova (20 solar masses), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from Earth (50 kiloparsecs).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass and distance to SI units:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\n1 parsec = 3.086 x 10^16 m\n50 kiloparsecs = 50 * 10^3 * 3.086 x 10^16 m = 1.543 x 10^21 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.543 x 10^21 m\n\nE â‰ˆ 2.08 x 10^46 J\n\nTherefore, the minimum energy released in the form of gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a mass of 20 solar masses and a distance of 50 kiloparsecs from Earth is approximately 2.08 x 10^46 Joules."
