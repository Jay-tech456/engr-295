    "message_1": "A container has a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 10 bar. Calculate the fugacity of the carbon dioxide if its mole fraction in the mixture is 0.4. (Assume ideal gas behavior)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide in the mixture, we can use the following equation for an ideal gas mixture:\n\nfugacity (f) = mole fraction (x) * partial pressure (P_partial)\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the mixture. The total pressure (P_total) is given as 10 bar, and the mole fraction (x_CO2) is given as 0.4. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P_CO2) can be calculated as follows:\n\nP_CO2 = x_CO2 * P_total\nP_CO2 = 0.4 * 10 bar\nP_CO2 = 4 bar\n\nNow that we have the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, we can calculate its fugacity (f_CO2) using the equation mentioned above:\n\nf_CO2 = x_CO2 * P_CO2\nf_CO2 = 0.4 * 4 bar\nf_CO2 = 1.6 bar\n\nSo, the fugacity of carbon dioxide in the mixture is 1.6 bar."
