    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point outside the solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law and the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of solenoid\nn = 500 turns / 0.3 m\nn ≈ 1666.67 turns/m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1666.67 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB ≈ 4.19 × 10^(-3) T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic field inside the solenoid. To find the magnetic field at a point outside the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a long straight wire:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * r)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the center of the solenoid to the point of interest. In this case, r = 0.02 m (radius of solenoid) + 0.05 m (distance from the center) = 0.07 m.\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.07 m)\nB_outside ≈ 5.72 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the solenoid is approximately 5.72 × 10^(-6) T. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you wrap your right hand around the solenoid with your fingers pointing in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in a circular pattern around the solenoid."
