    "message_2": "To estimate the maximum mass that a primordial black hole (PBH) could have in order to account for all of the observed dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the total amount of dark matter and the constraints on the PBH mass.\n\nThe total mass of dark matter in the universe is estimated to be around 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. The total mass-energy content of the universe is approximately 3 x 10^52 kg. Therefore, the total mass of dark matter is roughly:\n\n0.27 * (3 x 10^52 kg) â‰ˆ 8.1 x 10^51 kg\n\nNow, we need to consider the constraints on the PBH mass. PBHs are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They are not formed from the collapse of massive stars like stellar black holes. The mass of PBHs can range from very small (subatomic) to thousands of solar masses.\n\nThere are several observational constraints on the mass of PBHs, such as:\n\n1. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: PBHs with masses less than 10^14 kg would have evaporated by now due to Hawking radiation, which would affect the CMB.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: PBHs with masses between 10^20 kg and 10^24 kg would cause observable gravitational lensing effects, which have not been detected.\n\n3. Large-scale structure formation: PBHs with masses greater than 10^6 solar masses (2 x 10^36 kg) would disrupt the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nConsidering these constraints, the maximum mass of a PBH that could account for all the observed dark matter in the universe would likely be around 10^6 solar masses (2 x 10^36 kg). However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate and more research is needed to determine the exact mass range of PBHs that could account for all the observed dark matter."
