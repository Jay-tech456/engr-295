    "message_2": "The binary neutron star system J0737-3039A/B consists of two neutron stars, A and B, orbiting each other. To determine the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by this system, we can use the Kepler's third law and the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission.\n\nFirst, let's find the orbital frequency (f_orb) of the system. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit:\n\nP^2 ∝ a^3\n\nThe orbital period of J0737-3039A/B is approximately 2.4 hours or 8640 seconds. Therefore, the orbital frequency is:\n\nf_orb = 1 / P ≈ 1 / 8640 s ≈ 1.16 x 10^(-4) Hz\n\nNow, the frequency of gravitational waves (f_GW) emitted by the system is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orb ≈ 2 * 1.16 x 10^(-4) Hz ≈ 2.32 x 10^(-4) Hz\n\nThe expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary neutron star system J0737-3039A/B is approximately 2.32 x 10^(-4) Hz.\n\nTo infer the system's orbital decay rate based on its observed frequency evolution, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. The rate of change of the orbital period (dP/dt) is given by:\n\ndP/dt ∝ -P^(-8/3)\n\nThe observed value of dP/dt for J0737-3039A/B is approximately -1.25 x 10^(-12) s/s. Using this value, we can find the rate of change of the orbital frequency (df_orb/dt):\n\ndf_orb/dt = - (1 / P^2) * (dP/dt) ≈ - (1 / (8640^2)) * (-1.25 x 10^(-12) s/s) ≈ 1.59 x 10^(-15) Hz/s\n\nSince the frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency, the rate of change of the gravitational wave frequency (df_GW/dt) is:\n\ndf_GW/dt = 2 * df_orb/dt ≈ 2 * 1.59 x 10^(-15) Hz/s ≈ 3.18 x 10^(-15) Hz/s\n\nThe orbital decay rate of the binary neutron star system J0737-3039A/B, based on its observed frequency evolution, is approximately 3.18 x 10^(-15) Hz/s. This value indicates that the system is losing energy due to the emission of gravitational waves, causing the orbit to shrink and the neutron stars to spiral closer together over time."
