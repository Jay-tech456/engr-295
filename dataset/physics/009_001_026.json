    "message_1": "A light ray is incident on a glass slab of thickness 3 cm whose refractive index is 1.5. If the angle of incidence is 60°, find the angle of refraction, the lateral displacement of the emergent ray and the time taken by the ray to cross the slab.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (air, which is approximately 1), i is the angle of incidence (60°), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass, which is 1.5), and r is the angle of refraction.\n\n1 * sin(60°) = 1.5 * sin(r)\n\nsin(60°) = 0.866\n\n0.866 = 1.5 * sin(r)\n\nsin(r) = 0.866 / 1.5\n\nsin(r) = 0.577\n\nr = arcsin(0.577)\n\nr ≈ 35.3°\n\nThe angle of refraction is approximately 35.3°.\n\nNext, we can find the lateral displacement of the emergent ray. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nLateral Displacement = thickness * (tan(i) - tan(r))\n\nwhere thickness is the thickness of the glass slab (3 cm).\n\nLateral Displacement = 3 * (tan(60°) - tan(35.3°))\n\ntan(60°) = 1.732, tan(35.3°) ≈ 0.700\n\nLateral Displacement = 3 * (1.732 - 0.700)\n\nLateral Displacement ≈ 3 * 1.032\n\nLateral Displacement ≈ 3.096 cm\n\nThe lateral displacement of the emergent ray is approximately 3.096 cm.\n\nFinally, we can find the time taken by the ray to cross the slab. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = (thickness / cos(r)) / (speed of light / refractive index)\n\nwhere thickness is the thickness of the glass slab (3 cm), r is the angle of refraction (35.3°), and the speed of light is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nTime = (0.03 m / cos(35.3°)) / (3 * 10^8 m/s / 1.5)\n\ncos(35.3°) ≈ 0.819\n\nTime = (0.03 / 0.819) / (2 * 10^8)\n\nTime ≈ 0.0366 / 2 * 10^8\n\nTime ≈ 1.83 * 10^-10 s\n\nThe time taken by the ray to cross the slab is approximately 1.83 * 10^-10 seconds."
