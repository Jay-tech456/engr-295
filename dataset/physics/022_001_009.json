    "message_2": "The most plausible dark matter particle candidates based on current theoretical models are:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are hypothetical particles that interact with regular matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. WIMPs are expected to have masses in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton. They are difficult to detect because they do not interact via the electromagnetic force, making them invisible to telescopes and unable to emit, absorb, or reflect light.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are much lighter than WIMPs, with masses in the range of micro-electron volts (Î¼eV) to milli-electron volts (meV). Axions are also difficult to detect because they interact very weakly with regular matter and do not interact via the electromagnetic force.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak nuclear force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They only interact through gravity, making them potential dark matter candidates. Their masses are expected to be in the range of keV, making them heavier than active neutrinos.\n\nSeveral experiments are being conducted to search for these dark matter candidates:\n\n1. For WIMPs: Experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, direct detection experiments such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), XENON, and LUX, and indirect detection experiments like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are searching for WIMPs.\n\n2. For Axions: The Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) is a leading experiment searching for axions by looking for their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field.\n\n3. For Sterile Neutrinos: Experiments like the MiniBooNE and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are searching for sterile neutrinos by looking for anomalies in neutrino oscillations.\n\nDark matter candidates differ from regular matter particles in several ways:\n\n1. They do not interact via the electromagnetic force, making them invisible and challenging to detect directly.\n\n2. They are stable or have very long lifetimes, allowing them to persist in the universe since its early stages.\n\n3. They are non-relativistic (or \"cold\") at the time of structure formation, which is essential for explaining the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe properties that make dark matter candidates difficult to detect are their weak interactions with regular matter and their lack of interaction via the electromagnetic force. This means they do not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making them invisible to telescopes and requiring specialized experiments to search for their presence indirectly."
