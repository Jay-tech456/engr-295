    "message_2": "To find the spacing between the bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nΔy = (λL) / d\n\nwhere Δy is the spacing between the bright fringes, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the screen and the double-slit apparatus, and d is the slit separation.\n\nGiven the values:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 × 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\nL = 1 m\nd = 0.5 mm = 0.5 × 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔy = (600 × 10^(-9) m × 1 m) / (0.5 × 10^(-3) m)\n\nΔy = (600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.5 × 10^(-3))\n\nΔy = 1.2 × 10^(-3) m\n\nΔy = 1.2 mm\n\nSo, the spacing between the bright fringes on the screen is 1.2 mm."
