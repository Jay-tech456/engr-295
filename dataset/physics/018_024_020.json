    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of photon scattering off an electron in a high-energy experiment with an accuracy of 1 part per billion, we can use the Klein-Nishina formula, which describes the cross-section of Compton scattering of photons by electrons. The formula is as follows:\n\nσ(θ) = (r_e²/2) * (E'/E)² * (E'/E + E/E' - sin²(θ))\n\nwhere:\n- σ(θ) is the differential cross-section as a function of the scattering angle θ\n- r_e is the classical electron radius (approximately 2.82 x 10^(-15) m)\n- E is the initial energy of the photon\n- E' is the final energy of the photon after scattering\n- θ is the angle of incidence\n\nTo find the total cross-section, we need to integrate σ(θ) over all possible scattering angles (from 0 to π):\n\nσ_total = ∫[σ(θ) dθ] from 0 to π\n\nAfter finding the total cross-section, we can calculate the probability of scattering by considering the material and thickness of the target. The probability of scattering can be expressed as:\n\nP_scattering = 1 - exp(-n * σ_total * x)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number density of electrons in the target material\n- x is the thickness of the target\n\nGiven the initial energy of the photon, its angle of incidence, and the material and thickness of the target, you can plug in the values into these formulas to find the probability of photon scattering off an electron with an accuracy of 1 part per billion."
