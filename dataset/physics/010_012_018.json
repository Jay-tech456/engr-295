    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * (ν / U₀)^(1/2)) * (5^(1/2))\n\nwhere x is the length of the plate, ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and U₀ is the free-stream velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν) of the liquid. Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of dynamic viscosity (μ) to density (ρ):\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nGiven the dynamic viscosity (μ) of 0.01 Pa·s and the density (ρ) of 1000 kg/m³, we can calculate the kinematic viscosity:\n\nν = 0.01 Pa·s / 1000 kg/m³ = 1 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula for the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (2 m * (1 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s / 1 m/s)^(1/2)) * (5^(1/2))\n\nδ = (2 m * (1 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s)^(1/2)) * (5^(1/2))\n\nδ = (2 m * 0.003162 m) * 2.236\n\nδ ≈ 0.0141 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at the end of the 2-meter-long flat plate is approximately 0.0141 meters or 14.1 millimeters."
