    "message_2": "The decay $B \\rightarrow K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ is a flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process, which is highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism. The expected branching ratio for this decay in the SM is approximately $(1.0 - 1.5) \\times 10^{-6}$, depending on the specific theoretical calculations and input parameters.\n\nExperimental measurements of the branching ratio for this decay have been performed by several collaborations, including LHCb, BaBar, and Belle. The most recent measurements from LHCb are consistent with the SM predictions, with a measured branching ratio of $(1.28 \\pm 0.12) \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nHowever, there have been some tensions between the SM predictions and experimental measurements in the angular observables related to this decay, such as the lepton forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$) and the $P_5'$ observable. These deviations could potentially indicate new physics beyond the SM, such as contributions from new particles or interactions. However, it is important to note that these discrepancies could also be due to underestimated theoretical uncertainties or experimental issues.\n\nIf the deviations from the SM predictions were confirmed to be significant, it would have important implications for our understanding of fundamental particle physics. It could provide evidence for new physics beyond the SM, such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, or new gauge symmetries. This would motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations to identify the nature of the new physics and its implications for the SM and cosmology."
