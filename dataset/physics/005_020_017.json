    "message_2": "To find the frequency of light emitted by a moving source when observed by a stationary observer, we can use the Doppler effect formula for light. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler effect in light is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (c + v_observer) / (c + v_source)\n\nwhere:\n- f_observed is the frequency observed by the stationary observer\n- f_source is the frequency of the emitted light by the moving source\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- v_observer is the velocity of the observer (0 in this case, since the observer is stationary)\n- v_source is the velocity of the source (positive if moving away from the observer, negative if moving towards the observer)\n\nHowever, we are given the wavelength of the emitted light, not the frequency. To find the frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nf_source = c / λ_source\n\nwhere λ_source is the wavelength of the emitted light.\n\nNow we can substitute this into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = (c / λ_source) * (c + 0) / (c + v_source)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf_observed = c / (λ_source + (v_source * λ_source) / c)\n\nThis formula will give you the frequency of light emitted by a moving source when observed by a stationary observer, given the velocity of the source and the wavelength of the emitted light."
