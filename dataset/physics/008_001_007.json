    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has several decay channels, and the probability of each decay mode is represented by its branching ratio. The branching ratios depend on the mass of the Higgs boson (mH) and the total energy of the collision.\n\nFor a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.1 GeV, which is the experimentally measured value, the main decay channels and their approximate branching ratios are:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quarks (H → bb): ~58%\n2. Higgs to W bosons (H → WW): ~21%\n3. Higgs to gluons (H → gg): ~9%\n4. Higgs to tau leptons (H → ττ): ~6%\n5. Higgs to charm quarks (H → cc): ~3%\n6. Higgs to Z bosons (H → ZZ): ~2.5%\n7. Higgs to photons (H → γγ): ~0.2%\n8. Higgs to Z boson and photon (H → Zγ): ~0.02%\n\nThese branching ratios are subject to change for different Higgs boson masses. For example, if the Higgs boson mass were significantly lower, the decay to W and Z bosons would be kinematically forbidden, and the branching ratios for other decay channels would increase. Conversely, if the Higgs boson mass were much higher, the decay to top quarks (H → tt) would become possible, and the branching ratios for other channels would decrease.\n\nThe total energy of the collision does not directly affect the branching ratios of the Higgs boson decay channels. However, it does influence the production cross-section of the Higgs boson, which determines how often the Higgs boson is produced in collisions. Higher collision energies generally lead to higher production cross-sections, increasing the chances of observing Higgs boson decays.\n\nIn summary, the branching ratios of the Higgs boson decay channels depend on the Higgs boson mass, while the total energy of the collision affects the production cross-section of the Higgs boson. The branching ratios listed above are for the experimentally measured Higgs boson mass of 125.1 GeV."
