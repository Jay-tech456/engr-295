    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Friedmann equation, which describes the expansion rate of the universe, and the Hubble constant, which is the current rate of expansion. We will also need the distance measurements of supernovae to determine the age of the universe.\n\n1. Friedmann equation:\n\nThe Friedmann equation is given by:\n\nH^2 = (8πG/3)ρ - k/a^2\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, ρ is the energy density of the universe, k is the curvature constant, and a is the scale factor.\n\n2. Hubble constant:\n\nThe Hubble constant (H0) is the current rate of expansion of the universe. It is measured in units of km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec). The current accepted value is around 67.4 km/s/Mpc.\n\n3. Distance measurements of supernovae:\n\nSupernovae are used as standard candles to measure distances in the universe. Type Ia supernovae have a consistent peak luminosity, which allows us to determine their distance using the inverse square law. The distance modulus is given by:\n\nm - M = 5 log10(d/10pc)\n\nwhere m is the apparent magnitude, M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs.\n\n4. Calculating the expansion rate at a given time:\n\nUsing the Friedmann equation, we can calculate the expansion rate at a given time by substituting the values of ρ, k, and a. We can obtain these values from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n5. Determining the age of the universe:\n\nTo determine the age of the universe, we can use the Hubble constant and the distance measurements of supernovae. The age of the universe can be estimated by:\n\nt = 1/H0\n\nUsing the current value of the Hubble constant (67.4 km/s/Mpc), we get:\n\nt ≈ 1/(67.4 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 14.4 billion years\n\nThis is a rough estimate of the age of the universe. More accurate calculations would require integrating the Friedmann equation over time and considering the contributions of matter, radiation, and dark energy to the energy density of the universe."
