    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a particle with mass m and energy E is given by the Klein-Gordon equation. In one dimension, the equation is:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∂²/∂x²)ψ(x,t) = (m²c²/ħ²)ψ(x,t)\n\nwhere ψ(x,t) is the wave function of the particle, c is the speed of light, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the wave function can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nψ(x,t) = f(x)g(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the Klein-Gordon equation, we get:\n\nf(x)g''(t) - f''(x)g(t) = (m²c²/ħ²)f(x)g(t)\n\nDividing both sides by f(x)g(t), we obtain:\n\n(g''(t)/g(t)) - (f''(x)/f(x)) = (m²c²/ħ²)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call k:\n\ng''(t)/g(t) = k + m²c²/ħ²\nf''(x)/f(x) = k\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) f''(x) = kf(x)\n2) g''(t) = (k + m²c²/ħ²)g(t)\n\nThe solutions to these equations depend on the value of k:\n\n1a) If k > 0, f(x) = A * exp(√k * x) + B * exp(-√k * x)\n1b) If k = 0, f(x) = A * x + B\n1c) If k < 0, f(x) = A * cos(√(-k) * x) + B * sin(√(-k) * x)\n\n2) g(t) = C * exp(√(k + m²c²/ħ²) * t) + D * exp(-√(k + m²c²/ħ²) * t)\n\nTo determine the appropriate boundary conditions, we need more information about the physical situation. However, in general, the wave function ψ(x,t) should be normalizable, which means that it should go to zero as x goes to infinity. This condition usually implies that k must be negative in the spatial part of the solution.\n\nFinally, the wave function ψ(x,t) can be written as a linear combination of the solutions for f(x) and g(t):\n\nψ(x,t) = ∑[A_n * cos(√(-k_n) * x) + B_n * sin(√(-k_n) * x)] * [C_n * exp(√(k_n + m²c²/ħ²) * t) + D_n * exp(-√(k_n + m²c²/ħ²) * t)]\n\nwhere the coefficients A_n, B_n, C_n, and D_n depend on the specific boundary conditions and normalization requirements."
