    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a metal block with a mass of 150 grams which requires 480 Joules of heat energy to increase its temperature from 25°C to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of the metal block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in Joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\nQ = 480 J\nm = 150 g\nΔT = 50°C - 25°C = 25°C\n\nWe need to find the value of c. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 480 J / (150 g × 25°C)\nc = 480 J / 3750 g°C\nc ≈ 0.128 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the metal block is approximately 0.128 J/g°C."
