    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the proton, we can use the formula:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass of the proton, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm_0 = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.9c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.9c)^2 / c^2 = 0.81c^2 / c^2 = 0.81\n\nNow, we can find the denominator of the formula:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.81) = sqrt(0.19)\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.19) â‰ˆ 3.83 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton at this velocity is approximately 3.83 x 10^-27 kg."
