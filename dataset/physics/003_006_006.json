    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular coil, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of free space, N is the number of turns in the coil, I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven values:\nμ₀ = 4π x 10^-7 Tm/A\nN = 50 turns\nI = 2 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A * 50 * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 * 100) / 0.2\n\nB = (4π x 10^-5) / 0.2\n\nB = 2π x 10^-4 T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil is 2π x 10^-4 T (tesla)."
