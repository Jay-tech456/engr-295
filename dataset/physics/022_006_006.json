    "message_2": "The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Dark matter, which is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, is believed to make up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It interacts with normal matter (also known as baryonic matter) primarily through gravity, and this interaction has several observable effects on the structure of galaxies.\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: One of the first pieces of evidence for dark matter came from the observation of galaxy rotation curves. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity of stars in a galaxy should decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center. However, observations show that the orbital velocities of stars in spiral galaxies remain roughly constant at large distances from the center, suggesting the presence of an unseen mass (dark matter) that provides additional gravitational force to keep the stars moving at those velocities. This evidence indicates that dark matter forms a halo around galaxies, which extends beyond the visible edge of the galaxy.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Another piece of evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter comes from gravitational lensing. When light from a distant galaxy passes through a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the gravitational field of the massive object bends the light, causing the distant galaxy to appear distorted. The amount of distortion can be used to estimate the mass of the intervening object. Observations of gravitational lensing have shown that the mass of galaxy clusters is much greater than the mass of the visible matter, implying the presence of a significant amount of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies: The CMB is the radiation left over from the Big Bang, and its temperature fluctuations (anisotropies) provide information about the early universe's composition. Theoretical models and observations of the CMB anisotropies suggest that dark matter played a crucial role in the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark matter acted as a gravitational scaffold, attracting normal matter and helping it to form galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies in the universe is not random; instead, they are arranged in a cosmic web-like structure consisting of filaments, walls, and voids. Simulations of cosmic structure formation show that dark matter is essential for the formation of this large-scale structure. The gravitational influence of dark matter drives the collapse of normal matter into the dense regions where galaxies form.\n\n5. Galaxy mergers and collisions: Observations of galaxy mergers and collisions provide further evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter. In some cases, the collision between two galaxy clusters causes the hot gas (normal matter) to be separated from the dark matter. This separation can be observed through X-ray emissions from the hot gas and gravitational lensing effects caused by the dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the interaction between dark matter and normal matter has a significant impact on the structure of galaxies. Evidence from galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB anisotropies, large-scale structure formation, and galaxy mergers all support the existence of dark matter and its role in shaping the universe."
