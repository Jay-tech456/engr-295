    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section for the nuclear reaction between a neutron and helium-4 nuclei at an energy of 2 MeV, we need to know the interaction potential and the angular momentum of the system. However, since the problem does not provide the required nuclear data, we will use a simplified model called the Rutherford scattering formula to estimate the cross-section.\n\nThe Rutherford scattering formula for non-relativistic particles is given by:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z₁Z₂e²)² / (16E²sin⁴(θ/2))\n\nwhere σ(θ) is the differential cross-section, Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the interacting particles, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle (in this case, the neutron), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFor the nuclear reaction between a neutron and helium-4 nuclei, Z₁ = 0 (since neutrons have no charge) and Z₂ = 2 (since helium-4 has 2 protons). The energy E is given as 2 MeV, which we need to convert to Joules:\n\nE = 2 MeV * (1.6 x 10^(-13) J/MeV) = 3.2 x 10^(-13) J\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Rutherford scattering formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (0 * 2 * (1.6 x 10^(-19) C)²) / (16 * (3.2 x 10^(-13) J)² * sin⁴(θ/2)) = 0\n\nThe cross-section for the nuclear reaction between a neutron and helium-4 nuclei at an energy of 2 MeV is 0. This result is expected since the Rutherford scattering formula assumes that the interacting particles are charged, and in this case, the neutron is not charged. Therefore, the Rutherford scattering formula is not applicable to this problem.\n\nThe physical implication of this result is that the Rutherford scattering formula cannot be used to describe the interaction between a neutron and helium-4 nuclei. Instead, a more sophisticated model that takes into account the nuclear forces between the particles should be used to calculate the cross-section for this reaction."
