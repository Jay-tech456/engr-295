    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner core with a radius of 0.5 cm carrying a current of 5 A in the upward direction. The outer shell has a radius of 1 cm and carries a current of 2 A in the downward direction. Calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the net current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is symmetrical and can be determined by considering a circular Amperian loop with a radius r (0.75 cm in this case) centered at the cable's axis. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop, and the differential length vector (dl) is also tangent to the loop. Therefore, B⋅dl = Bdl, and the closed line integral becomes:\n\n∮Bdl = B∮dl = B(2πr)\n\nNow, we need to determine the net current enclosed by the Amperian loop. Since the loop is at a radial distance of 0.75 cm, it encloses the entire inner core carrying a current of 5 A in the upward direction. The outer shell carries a current of 2 A in the downward direction, but it is not enclosed by the loop. Therefore, the net current enclosed by the loop is 5 A.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we can now solve for the magnetic field:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I_enclosed\nB(2π(0.75 cm)) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(5 A)\n\nTo solve for B, divide both sides by 2πr:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(5 A) / (2π(0.75 cm))\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) T)(5) / (0.75)\nB = 10^(-5) T / 0.75\nB ≈ 1.33 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a radial distance of 0.75 cm from the center of the cable is approximately 1.33 × 10^(-5) T."
