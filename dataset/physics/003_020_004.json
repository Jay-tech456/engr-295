    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor has two plates of length 10 cm and separation distance 2 cm. A current of 2 A flows through the capacitor. Determine the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the capacitor.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the capacitor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's find the enclosed current within the Amperian loop. The Amperian loop is a rectangle with one side parallel to the plates and the other side perpendicular to the plates. The length of the side parallel to the plates is 10 cm, and the length of the side perpendicular to the plates is 5 cm (the distance from the center of the capacitor).\n\nThe current density (J) is uniform across the capacitor and can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere I is the current (2 A) and A is the area of the plates (10 cm × 2 cm = 20 cm²).\n\nJ = 2 A / 20 cm² = 0.1 A/cm²\n\nNow, let's find the enclosed current within the Amperian loop. The area of the Amperian loop is 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm². The enclosed current (I_enclosed) can be calculated as:\n\nI_enclosed = J × A_loop\nI_enclosed = 0.1 A/cm² × 50 cm² = 5 A\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field. We will consider the magnetic field at the midpoint of the side of the Amperian loop that is perpendicular to the plates and 5 cm away from the center of the capacitor. At this point, the magnetic field is parallel to the side of the loop that is parallel to the plates.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the side of the loop parallel to the plates, we can write the line integral as:\n\nB × L = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nwhere L is the length of the side of the loop parallel to the plates (10 cm).\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / L\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A. We need to convert the length L to meters:\n\nL = 10 cm × (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 5 A) / 0.1 m\nB ≈ (20π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / 0.1 m\nB ≈ 2π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the capacitor is approximately 2π × 10⁻⁶ T."
