    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the rectangular sheet, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, the Biot-Savart Law is more suitable for simple geometries like straight wires or loops. In this case, we have a rectangular sheet, which makes the calculations more complex. Instead, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to an infinite sheet of current, and then approximate our finite sheet as a combination of infinite sheets.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field (B) due to an infinite sheet of current is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), and d is the distance from the sheet (0.1 m).\n\nHowever, since we have a finite sheet, we need to use the method of images to approximate the magnetic field. We can consider the finite sheet as a combination of infinite sheets, and then subtract the magnetic fields due to the additional sheets to get the net magnetic field.\n\nFor a rectangular sheet of dimensions 20 cm x 40 cm, we can consider it as a combination of four infinite sheets, with two sheets having a width of 20 cm and two sheets having a width of 40 cm. The distance between the point and the edges of the sheets will be 10 cm and 20 cm, respectively.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic fields due to each of these sheets:\n\nB1 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * 0.1) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m) = 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB2 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * 0.2) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m) = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nNow, we can find the net magnetic field at the point above the center of the sheet:\n\nB_net = 2 * (B1 - B2) = 2 * (4 × 10^(-6) T - 2 × 10^(-6) T) = 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 10 cm above the center of the rectangular sheet is approximately 4 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
