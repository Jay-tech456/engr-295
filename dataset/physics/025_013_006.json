    "message_2": "The relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction in any medium, including the human eye, is described by Snell's Law. Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (θ₁) to the sine of the angle of refraction (θ₂) is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media (n₁ and n₂) involved:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(θ₂)\n\nIn the case of the human eye, light travels from air (n₁ ≈ 1.0003) into the cornea and aqueous humor (n₂ ≈ 1.336). Let's consider an example where the angle of incidence is 30 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ₁ = 30° * (π/180) ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction:\n\n1.0003 * sin(0.5236) = 1.336 * sin(θ₂)\n\n0.4998 ≈ 1.336 * sin(θ₂)\n\nsin(θ₂) ≈ 0.374\n\nθ₂ ≈ arcsin(0.374) ≈ 0.3817 radians\n\nConverting back to degrees:\n\nθ₂ ≈ 0.3817 * (180/π) ≈ 21.86°\n\nSo, in this example, when light enters the human eye at an angle of incidence of 30 degrees, it is refracted to an angle of approximately 21.86 degrees. This demonstrates that as the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases, but at a different rate due to the difference in refractive indices between the two media."
