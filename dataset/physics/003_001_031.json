    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. In this case, we will use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a long straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (5 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the wire is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
