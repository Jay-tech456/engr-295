    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the buoyant force acting on the block of wood, we can use the Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the object. \n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the submerged part of the block. Since three quarters of the block's volume is submerged, we can write:\n\nSubmerged volume = (3/4) * Total volume\n\nWe are not given the dimensions of the cube, so let's assume the side length of the cube is 'a' cm. Then, the total volume of the cube is:\n\nTotal volume = a³ cm³\n\nNow, we can find the submerged volume:\n\nSubmerged volume = (3/4) * a³ cm³\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the block. The density of water is 1 g/cm³. Using the formula for mass:\n\nMass of displaced water = Density of water * Submerged volume\nMass of displaced water = 1 g/cm³ * (3/4) * a³ cm³\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the displaced water using the formula:\n\nWeight = Mass * Acceleration due to gravity\nWeight = Mass of displaced water * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s² or 981 cm/s²).\n\nWeight = (1 g/cm³ * (3/4) * a³ cm³) * 981 cm/s²\n\nFinally, according to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water:\n\nBuoyant force = Weight\nBuoyant force = (1 g/cm³ * (3/4) * a³ cm³) * 981 cm/s²"
