    "message_2": "Increasing the load on a muscle affects both the duration and force of its contraction. When a muscle is subjected to a heavier load, it needs to generate more force to overcome the resistance. This is achieved through the recruitment of additional motor units and the increased firing rate of motor neurons. As a result, the force of contraction increases.\n\nHowever, the duration of contraction may be affected differently. When a muscle is subjected to a heavier load, it may fatigue more quickly due to the increased energy demand and metabolic stress. This can lead to a decrease in the duration of contraction as the muscle is unable to maintain the required force for an extended period.\n\nOn the other hand, if the muscle is well-trained and adapted to handle heavier loads, it may be able to maintain the increased force for a longer duration. This is because trained muscles have a higher capacity for energy production and are more resistant to fatigue.\n\nIn summary, increasing the load on a muscle generally leads to an increase in the force of contraction, while the duration of contraction may either decrease or remain unchanged depending on the muscle's level of training and fatigue resistance."
