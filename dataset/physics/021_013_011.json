    "message_2": "The gravitational pull of a black hole can have a significant impact on the temperature and patterns of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in its vicinity. This effect is primarily due to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing and the redshift caused by the black hole's immense gravity.\n\n1. Gravitational Lensing: A black hole's strong gravitational field can bend the path of light and other electromagnetic radiation, including CMB radiation. This bending of light is known as gravitational lensing. When CMB radiation passes near a black hole, its path is distorted, causing the CMB radiation to be focused or defocused. This can lead to the formation of multiple images or the magnification of the CMB radiation in certain regions. Consequently, the observed patterns of CMB radiation in the vicinity of a black hole can be significantly altered due to gravitational lensing.\n\n2. Redshift: The immense gravity of a black hole can also cause a redshift in the CMB radiation. As the CMB radiation moves away from the black hole, it loses energy and its wavelength increases, causing it to shift towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This redshift effect can lead to a change in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation in the vicinity of a black hole.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB radiation is related to its frequency, with higher frequencies corresponding to higher temperatures. Due to the redshift caused by the black hole's gravity, the CMB radiation's frequency decreases, which in turn causes a decrease in its temperature. This effect is known as the Sachs-Wolfe effect, which states that the temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation are caused by the gravitational redshift and blueshift as the radiation moves through the varying gravitational potentials in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational pull of a black hole can affect the temperature and patterns of cosmic microwave background radiation in its vicinity through gravitational lensing and redshift. These effects can lead to the distortion of the observed CMB radiation patterns and a decrease in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation near the black hole."
