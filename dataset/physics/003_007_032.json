    "message_1": "A current-carrying rod of length 0.5 meters is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field with a magnitude of 0.2 Tesla. If the current passing through the rod is 5 Amperes, what is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force acting on the rod?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic force acting on the current-carrying rod, we can use the formula:\n\nF = B * I * L * sin(theta)\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, B is the magnetic field, I is the current, L is the length of the rod, and theta is the angle between the current direction and the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the rod is placed perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the angle theta is 90 degrees. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nF = B * I * L\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nF = (0.2 T) * (5 A) * (0.5 m)\nF = 0.5 N\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the rod is 0.5 Newtons.\n\nTo find the direction of the magnetic force, we can use the right-hand rule. Point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the rod), and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. Your palm will then point in the direction of the force. In this case, since the rod is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force will be perpendicular to both the rod and the magnetic field."
