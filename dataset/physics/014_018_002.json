    "message_2": "The maximum amount of time a human can spend in space without being exposed to dangerous levels of cosmic radiation depends on several factors, including the shielding provided by the spacecraft, the solar activity, and the specific location in space.\n\nCosmic radiation consists of high-energy particles, mainly protons and helium nuclei, originating from outside our solar system. In addition to cosmic rays, astronauts in space are also exposed to radiation from the sun in the form of solar particle events (SPEs) and trapped radiation in Earth's magnetosphere, such as the Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nNASA has established radiation exposure limits for astronauts to minimize the risk of both short-term and long-term health effects. The career limit for astronauts is set at a 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) from cancer, which is based on age and sex. This limit is quantified in units of Sievert (Sv), a measure of the biological effect of ionizing radiation.\n\nFor a typical astronaut, the career limit ranges from approximately 1 to 4 Sieverts (Sv). On average, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive an annual dose of about 0.15 Sv, which is roughly equivalent to 0.5 millisieverts (mSv) per day. Based on this average dose rate, an astronaut could spend around 2000 to 8000 days (5.5 to 22 years) in low Earth orbit without exceeding the career limit. However, this is a rough estimate and does not account for variations in solar activity or specific shielding measures.\n\nIt is important to note that the radiation exposure in deep space, such as during a mission to Mars, would be significantly higher due to the lack of Earth's protective magnetic field. In such cases, the maximum time a human could spend in space without being exposed to dangerous levels of cosmic radiation would be considerably shorter, and advanced shielding technologies would be required to protect astronauts during long-duration missions."
