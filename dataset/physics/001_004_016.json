    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to transition a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n1 = 1) to its first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n1 = 1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nNext, let's find the energy of the first excited state (n2 = 2):\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 2^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4) = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, to find the energy required to transition from the ground state to the first excited state, we can subtract the energy of the ground state from the energy of the first excited state:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to transition a hydrogen atom from its ground state to its first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
