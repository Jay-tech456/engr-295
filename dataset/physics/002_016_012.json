    "message_2": "To determine the critical temperature of a substance, we can use the van der Waals equation of state for real gases. The critical point of a substance is defined by the conditions at which the gas and liquid phases are indistinguishable. At the critical point, the van der Waals equation can be written as:\n\nPc = (R * Tc) / (Vc - b) - a / Vc^2\n\nwhere Pc is the critical pressure, Tc is the critical temperature, Vc is the critical volume, R is the gas constant, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nWe are given Pc = 50 atm, Vc = 0.1 L/mol, a = 2.5 L^2*atm/mol^2, and b = 0.05 L/mol. We need to find Tc.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation to solve for Tc:\n\nTc = (Pc * (Vc - b) + a / Vc^2) / R\n\nWe also need the value of the gas constant R in the appropriate units. Since we are given pressure in atm and volume in L/mol, we will use R = 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for Tc:\n\nTc = ((50 atm) * (0.1 L/mol - 0.05 L/mol) + 2.5 L^2*atm/mol^2 / (0.1 L/mol)^2) / 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K\nTc = ((50 atm) * (0.05 L/mol) + 2.5 L^2*atm/mol^2 / 0.01 L^2/mol^2) / 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K\nTc = (2.5 atm + 250 atm) / 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K\nTc = 252.5 atm / 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K\nTc â‰ˆ 3074 K\n\nSo, the critical temperature of the substance is approximately 3074 K."
