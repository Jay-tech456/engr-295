    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which relates the observed frequency (f') to the emitted frequency (f) and the relative velocity (v) between the observer and the source:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + (v/c))/(1 - (v/c)))\n\nwhere:\nf' is the observed frequency\nf is the emitted frequency\nv is the relative velocity between the observer and the source (0.8c in this case)\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nf' = (6.0 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 + (0.8))/(1 - (0.8)))\n\nf' = (6.0 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1.8)/(0.2))\n\nf' = (6.0 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(9)\n\nf' = (6.0 x 10^14 Hz) * 3\n\nf' = 18.0 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the light observed by the astronaut inside the spaceship is 18.0 x 10^14 Hz."
