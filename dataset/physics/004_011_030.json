    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric is a solution to Einstein's field equations that describes a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is its electric charge, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates.\n\nThe event horizon of a charged black hole is determined by the radial coordinate r at which the metric coefficient g_rr (the inverse of the coefficient in front of dr²) becomes singular. This occurs when:\n\n1 - 2M/r + Q²/r² = 0\n\nSolving for r, we obtain the quadratic equation:\n\nr² - 2Mr + Q² = 0\n\nThe solutions to this equation give the radii of the inner (r_-) and outer (r_+) event horizons:\n\nr_± = M ± √(M² - Q²)\n\nThe mathematical relationship between charge and mass in the Reissner-Nordström metric is given by the ratio Q/M. This ratio affects the event horizon in the following ways:\n\n1. If Q² < M² (Q/M < 1), the black hole has two distinct event horizons, r_- and r_+. This is called a \"regular\" charged black hole.\n\n2. If Q² = M² (Q/M = 1), the black hole has a single degenerate event horizon at r = M. This is called an \"extremal\" charged black hole.\n\n3. If Q² > M² (Q/M > 1), there are no real solutions for the event horizons, and the black hole is called a \"naked singularity,\" which is a hypothetical object not protected by an event horizon.\n\nIn summary, the ratio of charge to mass in the Reissner-Nordström metric determines the number and location of event horizons for a charged black hole, with the event horizons being affected by the relative magnitudes of the charge and mass."
