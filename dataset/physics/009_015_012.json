    "message_1": "In an optical system consisting of a lens with a diameter of 10 cm and a focal length of 20 cm, the spherical aberration is observed to be 0.1 cm. Determine the distance from the center of the lens to the plane where the spherical aberration becomes zero.",
    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through different parts of a lens do not converge at the same point. In this problem, we are given the diameter of the lens (D = 10 cm), the focal length (f = 20 cm), and the spherical aberration (SA = 0.1 cm). We are asked to find the distance from the center of the lens to the plane where the spherical aberration becomes zero.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for spherical aberration:\n\nSA = (D^2 * h) / (64 * f)\n\nwhere SA is the spherical aberration, D is the diameter of the lens, h is the distance from the center of the lens to the plane where the spherical aberration becomes zero, and f is the focal length.\n\nWe are given SA, D, and f, and we need to solve for h. Rearranging the formula to solve for h, we get:\n\nh = (64 * f * SA) / D^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nh = (64 * 20 cm * 0.1 cm) / (10 cm)^2\nh = (1280 cm) / 100 cm^2\nh = 12.8 cm\n\nSo, the distance from the center of the lens to the plane where the spherical aberration becomes zero is 12.8 cm."
