    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns in the loop, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns in the loop. Since the wire is 2 meters long and bent into a circle with a radius of 0.5 meters, we can find the circumference of the circle:\n\nC = 2πR = 2π(0.5) = π meters\n\nNow, we can find the number of turns in the loop:\n\nN = Length of wire / Circumference = 2 / π ≈ 0.6366 turns\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A * 0.6366) / (2 * 0.5 m) ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current-carrying wire is approximately 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
