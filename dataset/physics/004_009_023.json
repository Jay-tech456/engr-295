    "message_2": "To calculate the event horizon size and angular momentum of a black hole based on the Kerr metric, we need to use the following formulas:\n\n1. Event horizon radius (r_+): r_+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\n2. Angular momentum (a): a = J/M = GJ/c^2M\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and J is the angular momentum of the black hole.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the black hole in kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole is 10 times that:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the angular momentum J. We are given the rotation rate of the black hole (1000 revolutions per second). We can convert this to radians per second:\n\nω = 1000 * 2π = 2000π rad/s\n\nThe moment of inertia (I) of a rotating black hole can be approximated as I ≈ (2/5)MR^2, where R is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius (R_s) can be calculated as:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2 = 2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 2.954 x 10^4 m\n\nNow we can find the moment of inertia:\n\nI ≈ (2/5)MR^2 ≈ (2/5) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) * (2.954 x 10^4 m)^2 ≈ 6.914 x 10^38 kg m^2\n\nNow we can find the angular momentum J:\n\nJ = Iω ≈ (6.914 x 10^38 kg m^2) * (2000π rad/s) ≈ 4.336 x 10^41 kg m^2/s\n\nNow we can find the angular momentum parameter a:\n\na = GJ/c^2M ≈ (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (4.336 x 10^41 kg m^2/s) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) ≈ 9.647 x 10^3 m\n\nFinally, we can find the event horizon radius r_+:\n\nr_+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2) ≈ (2.954 x 10^4 m) + sqrt((2.954 x 10^4 m)^2 - (9.647 x 10^3 m)^2) ≈ 3.097 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon size (radius) of the black hole is approximately 3.097 x 10^4 meters, and the angular momentum is approximately 4.336 x 10^41 kg m^2/s."
