    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of copper, we can use the Drude model formula for conductivity:\n\nσ = n * e^2 * τ / m\n\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the electron density, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), τ is the relaxation time, and m is the effective mass of the conduction electrons.\n\nFirst, we need to find the effective mass of the conduction electrons. We can do this by using the resistivity formula:\n\nρ = m / (n * e^2 * τ)\n\nwhere ρ is the resistivity of copper. Rearranging the formula to solve for m, we get:\n\nm = ρ * (n * e^2 * τ)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nm = (1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm) * (8.49 x 10^28 m^-3 * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * 2.3 x 10^-14 s)\nm ≈ 9.11 x 10^-31 kg\n\nNow that we have the effective mass of the conduction electrons, we can calculate the electrical conductivity using the Drude model formula:\n\nσ = (8.49 x 10^28 m^-3) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * (2.3 x 10^-14 s) / (9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\nσ ≈ 5.96 x 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of copper at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 5.96 x 10^7 S/m."
