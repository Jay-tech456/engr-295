    "message_2": "To find the change in entropy, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT * ln(T2/T1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the change in entropy, m is the mass of the block, c is the specific heat capacity, ΔT is the change in temperature, T1 is the initial temperature, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the block to grams:\n\nmass = 2.0 kg * 1000 g/kg = 2000 g\n\nNow, we can find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 125°C - 25°C = 100°C\n\nNext, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔS = (2000 g)(0.385 J/g °C)(100°C) * ln(125°C / 25°C)\n\nΔS = 77000 J/°C * ln(5)\n\nΔS ≈ 77000 J/°C * 1.609\n\nΔS ≈ 123893 J/°C\n\nThe change in entropy of the block is approximately 123,893 J/°C."
