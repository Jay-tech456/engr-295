    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the centers of the interference fringes produced by a double-slit setup, we can use the formula for the angular separation of the fringes:\n\nθ = λ / d\n\nwhere θ is the angular separation, λ is the wavelength of light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nd = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular separation:\n\nθ = (600 * 10^(-9) m) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m) = 3 * 10^(-6) rad\n\nTo find the distance between the centers of the interference fringes, we need to know the distance between the double-slit setup and the screen where the fringes are observed (L). However, this information is not provided in the problem. Assuming we have the distance L, we can use the small angle approximation to find the distance between the centers of the fringes (y):\n\ny = L * θ\n\nIf you provide the distance L, we can calculate the distance y between the centers of the interference fringes."
