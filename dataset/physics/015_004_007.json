    "message_2": "To calculate the total amount of energy emitted in gravitational waves by the supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass converted into gravitational wave radiation, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the mass converted into gravitational wave radiation. The problem states that 1% of the mass is converted, and the mass of the supernova is 20 times the mass of the sun. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the supernova is:\n\nMass_supernova = 20 * Mass_sun = 20 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can find the mass converted into gravitational wave radiation:\n\nMass_converted = 0.01 * Mass_supernova = 0.01 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg) = 3.978 x 10^29 kg\n\nNext, we can use the E = mc^2 formula to find the energy emitted. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s:\n\nE = (3.978 x 10^29 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 3.978 x 10^29 kg * 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nE = 3.5802 x 10^46 Joules\n\nSo, the total amount of energy emitted in gravitational waves by the supernova explosion is approximately 3.5802 x 10^46 Joules."
