    "message_2": "The critical current of a Josephson junction is the maximum current that can flow through the junction without any voltage drop across it. It is determined by the properties of the superconducting materials and the geometry of the junction. The critical current (I_c) can be described by the following equation:\n\nI_c = I_c0 * sin(δ)\n\nwhere I_c0 is the maximum critical current, and δ is the phase difference between the two superconductors.\n\nThe applied voltage across the Josephson junction affects the critical current through the AC Josephson effect. When a voltage (V) is applied across the junction, the phase difference (δ) evolves with time according to the relation:\n\nd(δ)/dt = 2 * π * (V / Φ_0)\n\nwhere Φ_0 is the magnetic flux quantum (approximately 2.067 x 10^-15 Weber).\n\nAs the phase difference changes with time, the critical current oscillates as a function of time, leading to an AC current across the junction. The amplitude of the AC current is still limited by the maximum critical current (I_c0), but the time-averaged current will be less than I_c0. In the presence of an applied voltage, the junction will no longer be in the zero-voltage state, and the critical current will be affected by the AC Josephson effect."
