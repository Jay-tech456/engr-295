    "message_2": "To find the relativistic momentum and energy of the proton, we'll first need to determine its relativistic mass. The relativistic mass (m) can be found using the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nRest mass (m0) = 1.0073 u\nSpeed of proton (v) = 0.75c\nSpeed of light (c) = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, we need to convert the rest mass from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u is approximately equal to 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nm0 = 1.0073 u * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/u) = 1.67262 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass (m):\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nm = (1.67262 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - (0.75c)^2/c^2)\nm = (1.67262 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.75^2)\nm = (1.67262 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.5625)\nm = (1.67262 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.4375)\nm = 1.67262 x 10^-27 kg / 0.661437\nm ≈ 2.529 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow that we have the relativistic mass, we can find the relativistic momentum (p) using the equation:\n\np = m * v\np = (2.529 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.75c)\np = (2.529 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.75 * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 5.685 x 10^-19 kg m/s\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic energy (E) using the equation:\n\nE = m * c^2\nE = (2.529 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 2.275 x 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the proton is approximately 5.685 x 10^-19 kg m/s, and its relativistic energy is approximately 2.275 x 10^-10 J."
