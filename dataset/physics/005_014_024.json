    "message_1": "A subatomic particle called the pion (π-meson) has a rest mass of 139.57 MeV/c² and decays into two gamma rays (photons), each with an energy of 67.5 MeV. Determine the speed of the pion before it decayed. Use special relativity to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of energy and momentum in the decay process. The energy and momentum of the pion before decay must be equal to the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons after decay.\n\nLet's denote the pion's energy before decay as E_pion and its momentum as p_pion. The energy of each photon after decay is given as E_photon = 67.5 MeV. Since the two photons have equal energy and are emitted in opposite directions, their momenta will cancel each other out, and the net momentum after decay will be zero. Therefore, the pion's momentum before decay must also be zero.\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum relation for the pion:\n\nE_pion² = (m_pion * c²)² + (p_pion * c)²\n\nSince p_pion = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nE_pion² = (m_pion * c²)²\n\nNow, let's find the total energy of the two photons:\n\nE_total = 2 * E_photon = 2 * 67.5 MeV = 135 MeV\n\nThis is the energy of the pion before decay:\n\nE_pion = E_total = 135 MeV\n\nNow we can find the pion's rest mass energy:\n\nm_pion * c² = 139.57 MeV\n\nNow we can use the energy-momentum relation:\n\n(135 MeV)² = (139.57 MeV)²\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\n(135/c)² = (139.57/c)²\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n135/c = 139.57/c\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the pion's total energy to its rest mass energy:\n\nE_pion / (m_pion * c²) = 135 MeV / 139.57 MeV = 0.967\n\nNow we can use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE_pion = γ * m_pion * c²\n\nWhere γ is the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nNow we can solve for the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = E_pion / (m_pion * c²) = 0.967\n\nNow we can solve for the pion's speed:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\n0.967 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n0.935 = 1 - v²/c²\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nv²/c² = 1 - 0.935 = 0.065\n\nNow, multiply both sides by c²:\n\nv² = 0.065 * c²\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nv = c * sqrt(0.065)\n\nv ≈ 0.255 * c\n\nSo, the speed of the pion before it decayed is approximately 0.255 times the speed of light."
