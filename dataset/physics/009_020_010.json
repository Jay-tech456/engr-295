    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of diffraction for the first-order maximum, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle of diffraction, m is the order of the maximum (in this case, m = 1 for the first-order maximum), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 5000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 cm / 5000 lines = 0.0002 cm\n\nNow, we need to convert d to meters:\n\nd = 0.0002 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.000002 m = 2 * 10^(-6) m\n\nNow we can use the grating equation to find the angle of diffraction:\n\n2 * 10^(-6) m * sin(θ) = 1 * (650 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nsin(θ) = (650 * 10^(-9) m) / (2 * 10^(-6) m)\n\nsin(θ) = 0.325\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.325:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.325) = 19.1°\n\nTherefore, the angle of diffraction for the first-order maximum is approximately 19.1°."
