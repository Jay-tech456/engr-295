    "message_1": "What is the lifetime of an excited state of a helium atom if it emits a photon with wavelength 1083.3 nm during its decay? Given that the initial state of the helium atom is n=3 and the final state is n=2. (Assuming that the lifetime is much longer than the time taken by an atom to emit a photon.)",
    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of the excited state, we can use the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission (A) and the energy difference between the initial and final states.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the emitted photon:\n\nE_photon = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (1083.3 nm = 1083.3 x 10^(-9) m).\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1083.3 x 10^(-9) m) = 1.831 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNow, let's find the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission (A):\n\nA = (64π^4 * e^2 * f^3) / (3h * c^3 * ε_0)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C), f is the frequency of the emitted photon, h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C^2/Nm^2).\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f):\n\nf = c / λ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1083.3 x 10^(-9) m) = 2.769 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can find A:\n\nA = (64π^4 * (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)^2 * (2.769 x 10^14 Hz)^3) / (3 * 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 * 8.854 x 10^(-12) C^2/Nm^2) ≈ 6.57 x 10^7 s^(-1)\n\nFinally, the lifetime (τ) of the excited state can be found by taking the inverse of A:\n\nτ = 1 / A ≈ 1 / (6.57 x 10^7 s^(-1)) ≈ 1.52 x 10^(-8) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state of the helium atom is approximately 1.52 x 10^(-8) seconds."
