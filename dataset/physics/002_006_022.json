    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at standard conditions, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy. \n\nSince we are given the standard enthalpy of formation for water (ΔHf^o) and the standard entropy change (ΔS^o) for the reaction, we can plug these values into the equation. We also need to consider that the reaction produces 2 moles of water, so we need to multiply the enthalpy of formation by 2.\n\nΔH = 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol) = -571.6 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard conditions for temperature is 298.15 K (25°C). Now, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-571.6 kJ/mol) - (298.15 K * 188.8 J/(mol*K))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy term to kJ/(mol*K) by dividing by 1000:\n\nΔG = (-571.6 kJ/mol) - (298.15 K * 0.1888 kJ/(mol*K))\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change:\n\nΔG = (-571.6 kJ/mol) - (56.34 kJ/mol) = -627.94 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change at standard conditions for the given reaction is -627.94 kJ/mol."
