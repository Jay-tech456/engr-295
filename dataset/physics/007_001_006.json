    "message_2": "The critical mass of Uranium-235 required for a nuclear fission reaction to occur depends on the shape, density, and purity of the material, as well as the presence of any neutron reflectors. However, a rough estimate for a bare sphere of highly enriched Uranium-235 is around 52 kg.\n\nTo calculate the number of fission reactions required to generate 1 megawatt of power for one year, we first need to convert the energy released per fission reaction from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). \n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, 200 million eV = 200 x 10^6 eV x 1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV ≈ 3.204 x 10^(-11) J\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy required to generate 1 megawatt of power for one year.\n\n1 MW = 10^6 W = 10^6 J/s\n\n1 year = 365 days x 24 hours/day x 3600 seconds/hour = 31,536,000 seconds\n\nTotal energy = Power x Time = 10^6 J/s x 31,536,000 s = 3.1536 x 10^13 J\n\nFinally, we can find the number of fission reactions required:\n\nNumber of fission reactions = Total energy / Energy per fission reaction = (3.1536 x 10^13 J) / (3.204 x 10^(-11) J) ≈ 9.84 x 10^23 fission reactions\n\nSo, approximately 9.84 x 10^23 fission reactions would be required to generate 1 megawatt of power for one year."
