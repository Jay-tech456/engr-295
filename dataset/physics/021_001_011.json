    "message_2": "The process of stellar collapse that leads to the formation of black holes involves several stages. It typically occurs in massive stars with a mass greater than 20 solar masses. Here's an overview of the process:\n\n1. Nuclear fusion: The star initially burns hydrogen in its core through nuclear fusion, producing helium. As the hydrogen fuel depletes, the core contracts and heats up, leading to the fusion of helium into heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and so on. This process continues, forming progressively heavier elements up to iron.\n\n2. Iron core formation: Once the core consists mainly of iron, further fusion is no longer energetically favorable. At this point, the core cannot generate enough outward pressure to counteract the inward pull of gravity, and the star becomes unstable.\n\n3. Core collapse: The iron core collapses under its own gravity, causing protons and electrons to combine into neutrons and releasing a burst of neutrinos. This rapid collapse takes only a fraction of a second and results in the formation of a dense, compact object called a neutron star.\n\n4. Supernova explosion: The outer layers of the star, which are still falling inward, rebound off the dense neutron star and are ejected in a massive explosion called a supernova. This explosion can outshine an entire galaxy for a short period.\n\n5. Black hole formation: If the mass of the collapsing core is above a certain threshold (approximately 3 solar masses), the gravitational force becomes so strong that not even neutrons can withstand it. The core continues to collapse, eventually forming a black hole.\n\nThe properties of the initial star play a significant role in determining the properties of the resulting black hole:\n\n- Mass: The mass of the black hole is directly related to the mass of the progenitor star. A more massive star will result in a more massive black hole. However, not all of the star's mass ends up in the black hole, as some of it is ejected during the supernova explosion.\n\n- Spin: The angular momentum of the initial star is conserved during the collapse process. As the core collapses, it spins faster due to the conservation of angular momentum, similar to how an ice skater spins faster when they pull their arms in. This means that a rapidly rotating star will likely result in a rapidly spinning black hole.\n\nIn summary, the process of stellar collapse leading to black hole formation involves the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, core collapse, and a supernova explosion. The mass and spin of the resulting black hole are determined by the properties of the initial star, specifically its mass and angular momentum."
