    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of nitrogen gas in the mixture using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the Peng-Robinson equation of state\n2. Calculate the fugacity coefficient for nitrogen\n3. Calculate the fugacity of nitrogen\n\nStep 1: Peng-Robinson equation of state\nThe Peng-Robinson equation of state is given by:\n\nP = (R * T) / (V - b) - a * α / (V^2 + 2 * b * V - b^2)\n\nwhere P is the pressure, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, V is the molar volume, a and b are the Peng-Robinson parameters, and α is the temperature correction factor.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fugacity coefficient for nitrogen\nThe fugacity coefficient (φ) can be calculated using the following expression:\n\nln(φ) = (Z - 1) - ln(Z - B) - (A / (2 * √2 * B)) * ln((Z + (1 + √2) * B) / (Z + (1 - √2) * B))\n\nwhere Z is the compressibility factor, A and B are dimensionless parameters, and A = a * P / (R * T)^2 and B = b * P / (R * T).\n\nTo calculate the fugacity coefficient for nitrogen, we need to determine the values of a, b, and α for nitrogen. These parameters can be found using the critical properties of nitrogen (Tc = 126.2 K, Pc = 33.5 atm) and the acentric factor (ω = 0.0372):\n\na = 0.45724 * (R^2 * Tc^2) / Pc\nb = 0.07780 * (R * Tc) / Pc\nα = (1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 * ω - 0.26992 * ω^2) * (1 - √(T / Tc)))^2\n\nStep 3: Calculate the fugacity of nitrogen\nOnce we have the fugacity coefficient for nitrogen, we can calculate the fugacity (f) using the following equation:\n\nf = φ * P * y\n\nwhere y is the mole fraction of nitrogen in the mixture.\n\nBy following these steps and plugging in the given temperature, pressure, and mole fraction of nitrogen, we can calculate the fugacity of nitrogen gas in the mixture using the Peng-Robinson equation of state."
