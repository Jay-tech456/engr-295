    "message_2": "The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves from a primordial black hole population depend on the masses of the black holes and their distance from the detectors. For a binary system of black holes, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / (M * t))^3/8\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system (in solar masses), and t is the time until coalescence.\n\nFor a primordial black hole population with masses ranging from 1 to 1000 solar masses, the frequency range of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated by considering the minimum and maximum masses of the binary systems. The minimum mass binary system would consist of two black holes with 1 solar mass each, while the maximum mass binary system would consist of two black holes with 1000 solar masses each.\n\nFor the minimum mass binary system (M = 2 solar masses), the frequency range can be estimated as:\n\nf_min = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / (2 * t))^3/8\n\nFor the maximum mass binary system (M = 2000 solar masses), the frequency range can be estimated as:\n\nf_max = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / (2000 * t))^3/8\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the distance to the source and the masses of the black holes. The amplitude can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nA = (4 * G * M * c) / (d * f^2)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, d is the distance to the source, and f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nGiven the current sensitivities of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, they are most sensitive to frequencies in the range of ~10 Hz to ~1000 Hz. Therefore, the expected frequency range of detectable gravitational waves from a primordial black hole population with masses ranging from 1 to 1000 solar masses would be within this range. The amplitude of the detectable gravitational waves would depend on the distance to the source and the masses of the black holes involved."
