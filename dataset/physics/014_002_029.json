    "message_2": "The current estimated age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. Our understanding of the universe's age has evolved significantly over time due to advancements in observational and theoretical cosmology.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the prevailing view was that the universe was static and eternal. However, in 1929, Edwin Hubble's observations of galaxies' redshifts led to the discovery that the universe was expanding. This expansion implied that the universe had a beginning, which laid the foundation for the Big Bang theory.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the age of the universe was estimated to be around 2 billion years based on the Hubble constant, which describes the expansion rate of the universe. However, this estimate was inconsistent with the age of the Earth, which was known to be older than 4 billion years.\n\nThe discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1965 provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory and allowed for more accurate age estimates. By the late 20th century, the age of the universe was estimated to be between 10 and 20 billion years, based on various measurements of the Hubble constant and the study of the oldest known stars.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite missions provided more precise measurements of the CMB radiation, leading to a more accurate estimate of the universe's age. The Planck mission, launched in 2009, measured the CMB with unprecedented precision and determined the age of the universe to be approximately 13.8 billion years, with an uncertainty of less than 1%.\n\nOur understanding of the universe's age will continue to evolve as new observational and theoretical advancements are made in cosmology. Future missions, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Euclid satellite, are expected to provide even more accurate measurements and insights into the early universe, further refining our understanding of its age and evolution."
