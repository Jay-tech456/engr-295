    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, the Biot-Savart law is typically applied to current-carrying wires, not solid spheres. To apply the Biot-Savart law to a solid sphere, we need to consider the sphere as a collection of infinitesimally small current loops. \n\nLet's assume that the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere. The surface current density K can be calculated as:\n\nK = I / (4πR^2)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nNow, consider a small current loop at a latitude angle θ (measured from the positive z-axis) on the sphere. The radius of this loop is:\n\nr_loop = R * sin(θ)\n\nThe width of this loop is:\n\nd_width = R * dθ\n\nThe length of this loop is:\n\nd_length = 2π * r_loop = 2πR * sin(θ)\n\nThe current in this loop is:\n\ndI = K * d_length * d_width = I * sin(θ) * dθ\n\nNow we can apply the Biot-Savart law to this small current loop. The magnetic field dB at a point P located 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center of the sphere due to this loop is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * d_length x r) / |r|^3\n\nThe magnetic field at point P due to the entire sphere can be obtained by integrating dB over all the current loops (i.e., integrating over θ from 0 to π):\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to π\n\nThis integral is quite complex and not easy to solve analytically. However, we can make an approximation based on the geometry of the problem. Since the point P is located outside the sphere (at a distance of 10 cm from the center), the magnetic field at P will be similar to that of a magnetic dipole. The magnetic field of a dipole at a point on its axis is given by:\n\nB_dipole = (μ₀ / 4π) * (m * 2) / r^3\n\nwhere m is the magnetic dipole moment and r is the distance from the center of the sphere to point P (0.1 m). The magnetic dipole moment of the sphere can be calculated as:\n\nm = I * π * R^2\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nm = 4 A * π * (0.05 m)^2 ≈ 0.0314 Am²\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field at point P:\n\nB_dipole = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.0314 Am² * 2) / (0.1 m)^3 ≈ 7.96 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be along the axis of the sphere, pointing from the south pole to the north pole (assuming the current is flowing from the north pole to the south pole).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 7.96 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is along the axis of the sphere, pointing from the south pole to the north pole."
