    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the formula for the characteristic strain amplitude, h_c:\n\nh_c = (4 * G^(5/3) * (M_chirp/c^2)^(5/3) * π^(2/3) * f^(2/3)) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))\n- M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational waves\n- D is the distance from the binary system to Earth\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the chirp mass, M_chirp:\n\nM_chirp = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes in solar masses. We'll convert these to kilograms by multiplying by the solar mass constant (1.9885 × 10^30 kg):\n\nm1 = 30 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 5.9655 × 10^31 kg\nm2 = 20 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 3.9770 × 10^31 kg\n\nM_chirp = (5.9655 × 10^31 kg * 3.9770 × 10^31 kg)^(3/5) / (5.9655 × 10^31 kg + 3.9770 × 10^31 kg)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 4.284 × 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves, f. This is a complex calculation that depends on the orbital parameters of the binary system. However, for simplicity, we can use the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the binary system:\n\nf_ISCO = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * (m1 + m2))\n\nf_ISCO ≈ 157.5 Hz\n\nNow, we need to convert the distance from Earth to the binary system from light years to meters:\n\n1 billion light years = 1 × 10^9 light years * 9.461 × 10^15 m/light year ≈ 9.461 × 10^24 m\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves, h_c:\n\nh_c ≈ (4 * (6.67430 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))^(5/3) * (4.284 × 10^31 kg)^(5/3) * π^(2/3) * (157.5 Hz)^(2/3)) / ((2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * 9.461 × 10^24 m)\nh_c ≈ 1.28 × 10^(-23)\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system with masses of 30 and 20 solar masses, respectively, at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth is approximately 1.28 × 10^(-23)."
