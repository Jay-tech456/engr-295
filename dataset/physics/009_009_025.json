    "message_2": "To find the distance between the object and the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the distance between the object and the mirror, and v is the distance between the image and the mirror.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the image distance (v) is 50 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/u + 1/50\n\nNow, we need to solve for u:\n\n1/u = 1/20 - 1/50\n\nTo solve for u, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/u = (50 - 20) / (20 * 50)\n1/u = 30 / 1000\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find u:\n\nu = 1000 / 30\n\nu = 33.33 cm (approximately)\n\nSo, the distance between the object and the concave mirror is approximately 33.33 cm."
