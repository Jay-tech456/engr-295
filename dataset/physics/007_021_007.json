    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of lead required to reduce the gamma radiation to one-tenth of its initial value, we can use the following equation:\n\nI = I0 * e^(-μx)\n\nwhere:\nI = final intensity (one-tenth of the initial intensity)\nI0 = initial intensity\nμ = attenuation coefficient (0.69 cm^-1)\nx = thickness of lead (in cm)\n\nSince we want to reduce the intensity to one-tenth of its initial value, we can set I = 0.1 * I0. Then, we can solve for x:\n\n0.1 * I0 = I0 * e^(-μx)\n\nDivide both sides by I0:\n\n0.1 = e^(-0.69x)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.1) = -0.69x\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = ln(0.1) / (-0.69)\nx ≈ 3.32 cm\n\nSo, a thickness of approximately 3.32 cm of lead is required to reduce the gamma radiation emitted by a 1 Curie source of Co-60 to one-tenth of its initial value."
