    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Several lines of evidence support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: According to Newtonian dynamics, the velocity of stars orbiting a galaxy should decrease as their distance from the galactic center increases. However, observations show that the velocities of stars in spiral galaxies remain roughly constant at large distances from the center, suggesting the presence of additional mass that cannot be accounted for by visible matter. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter surrounding the galaxies in a halo-like structure.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: General relativity predicts that massive objects can bend light due to their gravitational influence. Observations of gravitational lensing, where the light from distant galaxies is bent around massive foreground galaxy clusters, reveal that the mass distribution in these clusters is much greater than what can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the distribution of matter at that time. The observed pattern of CMB fluctuations is consistent with a universe composed of both dark matter and ordinary matter, with dark matter playing a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter. Dark matter is believed to act as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps hold these structures together and drives their formation.\n\n5. Numerical simulations: Computer simulations of cosmic evolution, which incorporate both dark matter and ordinary matter, produce results that closely match the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of dark matter within galaxies. As a theory of gravity, general relativity describes how massive objects like galaxies curve spacetime, influencing the motion of other objects, including dark matter. Dark matter is believed to interact primarily through gravity, so general relativity provides the framework for understanding how dark matter influences the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for dark matter comes from various astrophysical observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure formation, and numerical simulations. General relativity helps explain the behavior of dark matter within galaxies by providing a framework for understanding its gravitational interactions with visible matter and radiation."
