    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the first minimum is observed, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength is given in nanometers (nm) and the slit width is given in millimeters (mm). Let's convert both to meters (m):\n\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 6 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(6 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 3.44 * 10^(-4) radians\n\nTo convert the angle from radians to degrees, we can use the following conversion:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 3.44 * 10^(-4) * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 0.0197 degrees\n\nSo, the angle at which the first minimum is observed on the screen is approximately 0.0197 degrees."
