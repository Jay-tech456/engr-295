    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 10 cm, u = 30 cm\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n2/30 = 1/v\n\nInvert both sides to find v:\n\nv = 30/2\n\nv = 15 cm\n\nSo, the position of the image formed by the lens is 15 cm away from the lens.\n\nNow, to find the magnification of the image, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification = image distance / object distance\n\nmagnification = v / u\n\nmagnification = 15 cm / 30 cm\n\nmagnification = 0.5\n\nThe magnification of the image is 0.5, which means the image is half the size of the object."
