    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to investigate the state of polarization of light passing through a polarizer. The student conducted an experiment using a polarizer and a light source. The polarizer was rotated at different angles, and the transmitted light intensity was measured using a light sensor. The results were tabulated, and the graph was plotted. The student observed that the intensity of the transmitted light varied with the angle of rotation of the polarizer. Based on the observations, the student is required to:\n\nDetermine the polarization axis of the polarizer and the orientation of the incident light polarization relative to it.",
    "message_2": "To determine the polarization axis of the polarizer and the orientation of the incident light polarization relative to it, the student should analyze the plotted graph of transmitted light intensity versus the angle of rotation of the polarizer.\n\nThe intensity of the transmitted light through a polarizer can be described by Malus' Law:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted light intensity, I₀ is the initial light intensity, and θ is the angle between the polarization axis of the polarizer and the orientation of the incident light polarization.\n\nFrom the graph, the student should identify the maximum and minimum transmitted light intensities. The maximum intensity (I_max) corresponds to the angle at which the polarization axis of the polarizer is parallel to the orientation of the incident light polarization (θ = 0°). The minimum intensity (I_min) corresponds to the angle at which the polarization axis of the polarizer is perpendicular to the orientation of the incident light polarization (θ = 90°).\n\nOnce the angles corresponding to the maximum and minimum intensities are identified, the student can determine the polarization axis of the polarizer and the orientation of the incident light polarization relative to it. The polarization axis of the polarizer is parallel to the incident light polarization at the angle corresponding to the maximum intensity, and perpendicular to the incident light polarization at the angle corresponding to the minimum intensity."
