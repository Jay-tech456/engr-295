    "message_2": "The intensity of alpha particles in the Rutherford scattering experiment refers to the number of alpha particles incident on the thin gold foil per unit time. The alpha particles are helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons, and are positively charged. The experiment was designed to study the structure of atoms by observing the scattering of alpha particles after they pass through the thin gold foil.\n\nThe significance of the intensity of alpha particles is that it determines the number of scattering events that can be observed and analyzed. A higher intensity of alpha particles results in more scattering events, which in turn provides more data for analysis and a better understanding of the atomic structure.\n\nThe observed scattering angle is affected by the intensity of alpha particles in the sense that more scattering events provide a clearer picture of the distribution of scattering angles. However, the intensity of alpha particles does not directly influence the scattering angle itself. The scattering angle is primarily determined by the interaction between the positively charged alpha particles and the positively charged nucleus of the gold atoms.\n\nAccording to Rutherford's model, the scattering angle is related to the impact parameter (the distance of closest approach between the alpha particle and the nucleus) and the charge of the nucleus. When an alpha particle approaches a gold nucleus, the electrostatic repulsion between the two positive charges causes the alpha particle to be deflected. The closer the alpha particle gets to the nucleus, the stronger the repulsion, and the larger the scattering angle.\n\nIn conclusion, the intensity of alpha particles in the Rutherford scattering experiment is significant for obtaining a sufficient number of scattering events for analysis. However, it does not directly affect the observed scattering angle, which is determined by the interaction between the alpha particles and the gold nuclei."
