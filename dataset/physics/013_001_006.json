Assume the disk is made of gas that is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium and has a temperature of 10 million Kelvin.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole, we need to consider the gravitational potential energy that is converted into radiation as the gas falls into the black hole. The efficiency of this process is given by the radiative efficiency, which is typically around 10% for a non-rotating black hole.\n\nFirst, let's convert the accretion rate from solar masses per year to kilograms per second:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n0.1 solar masses per year = 0.1 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg/year = 1.989 x 10^29 kg/year\n\n1 year = 365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour = 3.1536 x 10^7 seconds\n\nAccretion rate = (1.989 x 10^29 kg/year) / (3.1536 x 10^7 s/year) = 6.309 x 10^21 kg/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released per unit mass as the gas falls into the black hole. This is given by the formula:\n\nE = (1 - sqrt(1 - (2GM/c^2R))) mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole (10 solar masses), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), R is the radius of the black hole (30 km), and m is the mass of the gas.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the black hole and its radius to SI units:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nR = 30 km * 1000 m/km = 3 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released per unit mass:\n\nE = (1 - sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * 3 x 10^4 m))) mc^2\n\nE ≈ 0.1 mc^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk by multiplying the energy released per unit mass by the accretion rate:\n\nTotal energy released = 0.1 * 6.309 x 10^21 kg/s * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nTotal energy released ≈ 5.678 x 10^41 J/s\n\nSo, the total energy released in the accretion disk of the black hole is approximately 5.678 x 10^41 Joules per second."
