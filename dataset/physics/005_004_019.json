    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth at a speed of 0.9c. If the spaceship has a rest mass of 1000 kg, what is its relativistic momentum and energy as measured by an observer on Earth? Also, how much kinetic energy does the spaceship have?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic momentum and energy, we'll need to use the following formulas:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p) = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and v is the velocity.\n2. Relativistic energy (E) = γmc^2, where c is the speed of light.\n3. Kinetic energy (K) = E - mc^2\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np = 2.294 * 1000 kg * 0.9c\np ≈ 2064.6 kg * c\n\nThe relativistic momentum is approximately 2064.6 kg*c.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = 2.294 * 1000 kg * c^2\nE ≈ 2.294 * 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 6.162 * 10^17 Joules\n\nThe relativistic energy is approximately 6.162 * 10^17 Joules.\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = E - mc^2\nK = 6.162 * 10^17 Joules - 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 6.162 * 10^17 Joules - 9 * 10^16 Joules\nK ≈ 5.262 * 10^17 Joules\n\nThe kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 5.262 * 10^17 Joules."
