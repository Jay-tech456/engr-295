    "message_2": "To determine the crystal structure of a sample using X-ray diffraction data, the student needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the diffraction peaks: Analyze the X-ray diffraction pattern and identify the positions and intensities of the diffraction peaks.\n\n2. Calculate the interplanar spacings (d): Using Bragg's Law, nλ = 2d sinθ, where n is an integer (usually 1), λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and θ is the angle of diffraction, calculate the interplanar spacings (d) for each peak.\n\n3. Determine the Miller indices (h, k, l): The Miller indices are a set of three integers that describe the orientation of the crystal planes responsible for each diffraction peak. To find the Miller indices, first find the reciprocal of the squared interplanar spacings (1/d^2) and normalize them to the smallest value. The normalized values should be close to the square of small integers, which represent the Miller indices (h, k, l).\n\n4. Identify the crystal system: Based on the Miller indices and the interplanar spacings, identify the crystal system of the sample (e.g., cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, etc.).\n\n5. Determine the lattice parameters: Using the interplanar spacings and the Miller indices, calculate the lattice parameters (e.g., a, b, c, α, β, γ) for the crystal system.\n\n6. Identify the crystal structure: Based on the crystal system, lattice parameters, and the positions and intensities of the diffraction peaks, identify the crystal structure of the sample (e.g., face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, etc.).\n\nPlease note that without the actual X-ray diffraction pattern, it is impossible to provide a specific crystal structure for the sample. The student should follow the steps outlined above using their experimental data to determine the crystal structure."
