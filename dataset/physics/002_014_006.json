    "message_1": "A refrigerator has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.0 when operating between 5°C and -20°C. What is the amount of energy required to extract 1000 J of heat from the refrigerated space?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat extracted from the refrigerated space (Q_cold) to the work input (W) required to run the refrigerator. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_cold / W\n\nIn this problem, we are given the COP as 3.0 and the heat extracted from the refrigerated space (Q_cold) as 1000 J. We need to find the amount of work input (W) required to extract this heat.\n\nRearranging the formula for W, we get:\n\nW = Q_cold / COP\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nW = 1000 J / 3.0\n\nW = 333.33 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to extract 1000 J of heat from the refrigerated space is approximately 333.33 J."
