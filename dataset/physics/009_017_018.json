    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and second minima on the screen, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, a is the width of the slit, and m is the order of the minimum.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angle for the first minimum (m = 1) and the second minimum (m = 2):\n\nsin(θ1) = (1 * λ) / a\nsin(θ2) = (2 * λ) / a\n\nNext, we can use the small angle approximation (tan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ for small angles) and the formula for the distance between the minima on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slit and the screen (1.5 m), and y is the distance between the minima on the screen.\n\ny1 = L * θ1\ny2 = L * θ2\n\nNow, we can find the difference between y1 and y2:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = L * (θ2 - θ1)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nΔy = 1.5 * ((2 * λ) / a - (1 * λ) / a)\n\nΔy = 1.5 * (λ / a)\n\nΔy = 1.5 * (632.8 * 10^(-9) m) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nΔy ≈ 0.00474 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second minima on the screen is approximately 4.74 mm."
