    "message_1": "A physics student wants to design a mirror that can create an image that is magnified by a factor of 5. What should be the minimum radius of curvature for the mirror so that the magnification can be achieved for an object that is placed 10 cm away from the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum radius of curvature for the mirror, we can use the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\n\nThe mirror equation is:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance (10 cm in this case), and di is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification equation is:\nM = -di/do\n\nWhere M is the magnification (-5 for a magnification of 5 times), di is the image distance, and do is the object distance (10 cm).\n\nFirst, we need to find the image distance (di) using the magnification equation:\n\n-5 = -di/10\ndi = 50 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the focal length (f):\n\n1/f = 1/10 + 1/50\n1/f = 6/50\nf = 50/6\nf ≈ 8.33 cm\n\nThe radius of curvature (R) is related to the focal length by the equation:\n\nR = 2f\n\nSo, the minimum radius of curvature for the mirror is:\n\nR = 2 * 8.33 cm ≈ 16.67 cm"
