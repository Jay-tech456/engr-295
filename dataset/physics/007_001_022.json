    "message_2": "To initiate a nuclear fission reaction with Uranium-235, a neutron needs to be absorbed by the nucleus. The minimum amount of energy required for this is called the fission barrier, which is approximately 6 MeV (Mega-electron volts) for Uranium-235. This energy is needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons and the strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together.\n\nWhen a Uranium-235 nucleus undergoes fission, it typically splits into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments), along with the release of a few neutrons and a large amount of energy. The maximum amount of energy that can be released from a single fission event of Uranium-235 is about 200 MeV. This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, kinetic energy of the emitted neutrons, and gamma radiation.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual energy released in a fission reaction can vary depending on the specific fission fragments produced and the number of neutrons emitted. However, the average energy released per fission event for Uranium-235 is around 193.7 MeV."
