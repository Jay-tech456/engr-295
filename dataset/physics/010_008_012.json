    "message_1": "A bronze ball has a mass of 200 grams in air. It is then placed in water, where it displaces 18.3 cm3 of water. What is the density of the bronze? (Assume the density of water is 1 g/cm3)",
    "message_2": "To find the density of the bronze ball, we can use the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nWe are given the mass of the ball (200 grams) and the volume of water displaced (18.3 cm³). The volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the bronze ball since it is fully submerged in water.\n\nSo, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nDensity = 200 g / 18.3 cm³\n\nDensity ≈ 10.93 g/cm³\n\nThe density of the bronze ball is approximately 10.93 g/cm³."
