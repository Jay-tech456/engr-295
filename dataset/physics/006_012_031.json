    "message_2": "To calculate the ionization energy of a Lithium atom in the ground state, we can use the formula for the ionization energy of a hydrogen-like atom:\n\nIonization Energy (IE) = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number (number of protons) and n is the principal quantum number of the electron being removed.\n\nFor Lithium (Li), Z = 3 (since it has 3 protons), and the electron being removed is from the outermost shell, which is the second shell (n = 2).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nIE = -13.6 eV * (3^2 / 2^2)\nIE = -13.6 eV * (9 / 4)\nIE = -13.6 eV * 2.25\nIE = -30.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy of a Lithium atom in the ground state is approximately 30.6 eV. Note that the value is negative because energy is required to remove the electron (ionize the atom), so the actual ionization energy is 30.6 eV."
