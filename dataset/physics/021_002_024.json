    "message_2": "The size and shape of a black hole's event horizon are determined by its mass and spin. There are two main types of black holes: non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black holes and rotating (Kerr) black holes. The Schwarzschild equation and the Kerr metric are used to describe these black holes, respectively.\n\n1. Schwarzschild black holes (non-rotating):\n\nThe Schwarzschild equation describes the geometry of spacetime around a non-rotating black hole. The event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is a perfect sphere, and its size is determined by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is directly proportional to its mass (M). The equation for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. The event horizon is located at a distance of Rs from the black hole's center. As the mass of the black hole increases, the size of the event horizon also increases.\n\n2. Kerr black holes (rotating):\n\nThe Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime around a rotating black hole. The event horizon of a Kerr black hole is more complex than that of a Schwarzschild black hole, as it is influenced by both the mass and the spin (angular momentum) of the black hole. The spin parameter (a) is defined as:\n\na = J/Mc\n\nwhere J is the angular momentum of the black hole. The size and shape of the event horizon are determined by the mass and spin of the black hole.\n\nFor a Kerr black hole, there are two event horizons: the outer event horizon and the inner event horizon (also known as the Cauchy horizon). The radii of these horizons are given by:\n\nR± = GM/c^2 ± sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\n\nAs the spin of the black hole increases, the outer event horizon becomes more oblate (flattened at the poles), and the inner event horizon becomes more prolate (elongated at the poles). If the spin parameter a reaches its maximum value (a = GM/c^2), the two event horizons merge, and the black hole becomes an extremal black hole. In this case, the event horizon is located at:\n\nR_extremal = GM/c^2\n\nIn summary, the size and shape of a black hole's event horizon are determined by its mass and spin. The Schwarzschild equation is used to describe the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, while the Kerr metric is used for rotating black holes. As the mass of the black hole increases, the size of the event horizon increases, and as the spin increases, the shape of the event horizon becomes more oblate."
