    "message_2": "To determine the critical angle of attack at which a wing starts experiencing flow separation and stalls, the student needs to consider several factors, including the airfoil's shape, the Reynolds number, and the fluid flow's velocity. Here's a step-by-step process to solve this problem:\n\n1. Obtain the airfoil's shape: The student needs to know the specific airfoil shape they are working with, as different airfoil shapes have different stall characteristics. Common airfoil shapes include NACA 4-digit series, Clark Y, and symmetric airfoils.\n\n2. Calculate the Reynolds number (Re): The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that helps predict flow patterns in fluid dynamics. It is defined as:\n\nRe = (ρ * V * L) / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, V is the fluid velocity, L is the characteristic length (usually the chord length of the airfoil), and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\n3. Determine the critical angle of attack: The critical angle of attack is the angle at which the airfoil experiences flow separation and stalls. This angle depends on the airfoil's shape and the Reynolds number. For most airfoils, the critical angle of attack is typically between 12° and 20°. However, this value can vary significantly depending on the specific airfoil and flow conditions.\n\nTo find the critical angle of attack for the given airfoil shape and Reynolds number, the student can refer to experimental data, wind tunnel tests, or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Many airfoil databases, such as the UIUC Airfoil Data Site or the NACA Airfoil Database, provide information on the critical angle of attack for various airfoil shapes and Reynolds numbers.\n\n4. Analyze the results: Once the critical angle of attack is determined, the student can use this information to analyze the wing's performance and design. For example, they can calculate the lift coefficient at the critical angle of attack to determine the maximum lift the wing can generate before stalling.\n\nIn summary, to determine the critical angle of attack at which a wing starts experiencing flow separation and stalls, the student needs to know the airfoil's shape, calculate the Reynolds number, and refer to experimental data or simulations to find the critical angle of attack for the given conditions."
