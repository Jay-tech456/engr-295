    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of a lithium-7 atom, we need to consider the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the magnetic field produced by the electron. The hyperfine splitting energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = A * I * J\n\nwhere ΔE is the hyperfine splitting energy, A is the hyperfine structure constant, I is the nuclear spin, and J is the total angular momentum of the electron.\n\nFor lithium-7, the nuclear spin I = 3/2 (since it has 3 protons and 4 neutrons), and the ground state electron configuration is 1s² 2s¹. The total angular momentum of the electron in the ground state (2s¹) is J = 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the hyperfine structure constant A. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = (16π/3) * (μN * μB * R) / a₀³\n\nwhere μN is the nuclear magneton, μB is the Bohr magneton, R is the Rydberg constant, and a₀ is the Bohr radius.\n\nμN = 3.15245 × 10⁻⁸ eV/T\nμB = 5.78838 × 10⁻⁵ eV/T\nR = 1.097373 × 10⁷ m⁻¹\na₀ = 5.29177 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = (16π/3) * (3.15245 × 10⁻⁸ * 5.78838 × 10⁻⁵ * 1.097373 × 10⁷) / (5.29177 × 10⁻¹¹)³\nA ≈ 413.06 MHz\n\nNow, we can calculate the hyperfine splitting energy:\n\nΔE = A * I * J\nΔE = 413.06 MHz * (3/2) * (1/2)\nΔE ≈ 309.795 MHz\n\nSo, the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of lithium-7 atom is approximately 309.795 MHz."
