    "message_2": "The thermal expansion coefficient (α) is a measure of how much a material expands when its temperature changes. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = (ΔL / L) / ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L is the original length (lattice constant), and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\nLattice constant (L) = 5 Å\nChange in length (ΔL) = 0.0025 Å\nTemperature change (ΔT) = 50 K\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nα = (0.0025 Å / 5 Å) / 50 K\n\nα = 0.0005 / 50 K\n\nα = 1 × 10^(-5) K^(-1)\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of the cubic crystal is 1 × 10^(-5) K^(-1)."
