    "message_2": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor a large composite number into its prime factors. It was developed by Peter Shor in 1994 and is significantly faster than classical algorithms for the same task. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Shor's algorithm works:\n\n1. Choose a random integer 'a' such that 1 < a < N, where N is the composite number to be factored.\n\n2. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and N using Euclid's algorithm. If GCD(a, N) > 1, then the factors of N are GCD(a, N) and N/GCD(a, N). If GCD(a, N) = 1, proceed to the next step.\n\n3. Find the order 'r' of 'a' modulo N, which is the smallest positive integer such that a^r % N = 1. This step is performed using a quantum subroutine called the quantum order-finding algorithm, which is the core of Shor's algorithm.\n\n4. If 'r' is odd or a^(r/2) % N = -1, go back to step 1 and choose a new random integer 'a'. If 'r' is even and a^(r/2) % N ≠ -1, proceed to the next step.\n\n5. Calculate the factors of N as GCD(a^(r/2) ± 1, N). If the factors are trivial (i.e., 1 or N), go back to step 1 and choose a new random integer 'a'. Otherwise, the factors are non-trivial and the algorithm is successful.\n\nThe probability of success for factoring a given large number using Shor's algorithm depends on the probability of finding a suitable 'a' and 'r' in steps 1 and 3. In general, the probability of success is at least 50% for each iteration of the algorithm, meaning that after a few iterations, the probability of finding the factors becomes very high.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, Shor's algorithm is exponentially faster than classical algorithms for factoring large numbers. The best-known classical algorithm is the general number field sieve, which has a sub-exponential runtime complexity of O(exp(c * (ln N)^(1/3) * (ln ln N)^(2/3))), where c is a constant. In contrast, Shor's algorithm has a polynomial runtime complexity of O((log N)^3), making it significantly more efficient for factoring large numbers.\n\nIn summary, Shor's algorithm is a powerful quantum algorithm for factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. It leverages the quantum order-finding algorithm to find the order 'r' of a random integer 'a' modulo N, and then uses this information to efficiently compute the factors of N. The algorithm has a high probability of success and is exponentially faster than classical algorithms for the same task."
