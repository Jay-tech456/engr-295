    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation states that the time experienced by a moving object (proper time) is shorter than the time experienced by an observer at rest (coordinate time).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = Δτ / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the coordinate time, Δτ is the proper time, v is the velocity of the moving object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the lifetime of the particle (proper time) is 5 microseconds and its speed is 0.8c, we can calculate the coordinate time (Δt) experienced by an observer at rest:\n\nΔt = (5 x 10^-6 s) / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nΔt = (5 x 10^-6 s) / √(1 - 0.64)\nΔt = (5 x 10^-6 s) / √(0.36)\nΔt = (5 x 10^-6 s) / 0.6\nΔt ≈ 8.33 x 10^-6 s\n\nNow that we have the coordinate time, we can calculate the distance traveled by the particle before it decays:\n\ndistance = speed × time\ndistance = 0.8c × 8.33 x 10^-6 s\n\nSince c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\ndistance = 0.8 × (3 x 10^8 m/s) × 8.33 x 10^-6 s\ndistance ≈ 2 x 10^8 m/s × 8.33 x 10^-6 s\ndistance ≈ 1.666 x 10^8 m × 8.33 x 10^-6\ndistance ≈ 1.387 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the particle travels approximately 1,387 meters before it decays."
