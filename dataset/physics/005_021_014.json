    "message_1": "A rocket traveling at 0.8c relative to Earth emits a beam of light towards the planet. What is the speed of the beam of light relative to an observer on Earth?",
    "message_2": "According to the theory of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always constant and equal to approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or 186,282 miles per second (mi/s), regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. This constant is denoted by the letter \"c\". \n\nSo, even if the rocket is traveling at 0.8c (80% the speed of light) relative to Earth, the beam of light it emits will still travel at the speed of light, c, relative to an observer on Earth. Therefore, the speed of the beam of light relative to the observer on Earth is 299,792 km/s or 186,282 mi/s."
