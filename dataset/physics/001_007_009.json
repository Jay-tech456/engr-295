    "message_2": "To find the ground state energy and corresponding wavefunction of a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the following formulas:\n\nGround state energy: E_0 = (1/2) * hbar * omega\nWavefunction: psi_0(x) = (m * omega / (pi * hbar))^1/4 * exp(-m * omega * x^2 / (2 * hbar))\n\nwhere hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator, and m is the mass of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (omega) using the spring constant (k) and mass (m):\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nomega = sqrt(250 N/m / 0.015 kg) ≈ 40.8248 s^-1\n\nNow we can find the ground state energy (E_0):\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * hbar * omega ≈ (1/2) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) * (40.8248 s^-1) ≈ 2.1535 × 10^-33 J\n\nFinally, we can write the wavefunction (psi_0(x)):\n\npsi_0(x) = (0.015 kg * 40.8248 s^-1 / (pi * 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js))^1/4 * exp(-0.015 kg * 40.8248 s^-1 * x^2 / (2 * 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js))\n\nSimplifying the constants:\n\npsi_0(x) ≈ (2.284 × 10^16 m^(-1/2)) * exp(-7.229 × 10^33 m^-1 * x^2)\n\nSo, the ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 2.1535 × 10^-33 J, and the corresponding wavefunction is psi_0(x) ≈ (2.284 × 10^16 m^(-1/2)) * exp(-7.229 × 10^33 m^-1 * x^2)."
