    "message_1": "A physics student is given a radioactive source with an emission rate of 5 microcuries and two Geiger counters with different efficiencies of 60% and 80%. The student needs to determine the distance between the source and the counters using the counts per minute measured by each Geiger counter. What is the distance between the radioactive source and the two Geiger counters?",
    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the radioactive source and the two Geiger counters, we need to use the inverse square law for radiation intensity. The inverse square law states that the intensity (I) of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (d) from the source:\n\nI = k / d^2\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nLet's denote the counts per minute measured by the 60% efficient Geiger counter as C1 and the counts per minute measured by the 80% efficient Geiger counter as C2. The actual counts per minute emitted by the source are 5 microcuries * 3.7 * 10^4 disintegrations per minute per microcurie = 1.85 * 10^5 disintegrations per minute.\n\nNow, we can write the intensity for each Geiger counter as:\n\nI1 = 0.6 * C1\nI2 = 0.8 * C2\n\nSince the intensity is proportional to the counts per minute, we can write the inverse square law for each Geiger counter:\n\nI1 = k / d1^2\nI2 = k / d2^2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for I1 and I2, we get:\n\n0.6 * C1 = k / d1^2\n0.8 * C2 = k / d2^2\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the distances d1 and d2. Dividing the first equation by the second equation, we get:\n\n(0.6 * C1) / (0.8 * C2) = (d2^2) / (d1^2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.75 * (C1 / C2) = (d2 / d1)^2\n\nTo find the distance between the radioactive source and the two Geiger counters, we need the actual counts per minute (C1 and C2) measured by each Geiger counter. Once we have these values, we can use the above equation to find the ratio of the distances d1 and d2. Then, we can use the inverse square law to find the actual distances d1 and d2 from the radioactive source."
