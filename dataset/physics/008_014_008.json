    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, the rare decay of a B meson (specifically, a B_s meson) into two muons (μ⁺ and μ⁻) is a flavor-changing neutral current process. This decay is highly suppressed due to its loop-level nature and helicity suppression. The theoretical prediction for the branching ratio of this decay, B(B_s → μ⁺μ⁻), is approximately (3.65 ± 0.23) × 10⁻⁹.\n\nExperimental measurements of this branching ratio have been performed by the LHCb, CMS, and ATLAS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The combined measurement from these experiments is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. The most recent combined result is:\n\nB(B_s → μ⁺μ⁻) = (2.8 ± 0.6) × 10⁻⁹.\n\nThe experimental measurement is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, which supports the validity of the Standard Model. However, it is important to continue refining both the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to search for potential deviations that could hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model."
