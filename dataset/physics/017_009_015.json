    "message_2": "The origin of spin transfer torque (STT) effect in spintronics lies in the interaction between the spin angular momentum of conduction electrons and the magnetization of magnetic layers in nanoscale devices. The STT effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum when electrons with a specific spin orientation are transferred between two magnetic layers with different magnetization directions.\n\nIn magnetic nanodevices like magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ), the STT effect is used to manipulate the magnetization of the free magnetic layer. An MTJ consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating barrier. One of the magnetic layers has a fixed magnetization direction (pinned layer), while the other has a variable magnetization direction (free layer). When a current is passed through the MTJ, electrons with a specific spin orientation tunnel through the insulating barrier from the pinned layer to the free layer.\n\nAs the electrons with a specific spin orientation tunnel through the barrier, they transfer their spin angular momentum to the free layer. This transfer of spin angular momentum exerts a torque on the free layer's magnetization, causing it to change its direction. This change in magnetization direction can be used to switch the free layer's magnetization between two stable states, corresponding to parallel and antiparallel alignment with the pinned layer's magnetization. These two states represent binary information (0 and 1) in spintronic devices like magnetic random access memory (MRAM).\n\nThe STT effect has several advantages in manipulating magnetization in magnetic nanodevices. It allows for lower power consumption, faster switching times, and better scalability compared to traditional magnetic field-based techniques. As a result, STT-based devices have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory and logic applications."
