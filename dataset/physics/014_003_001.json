    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), which is just a few degrees above absolute zero. This value is derived from precise measurements made by various experiments and satellite missions, such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck satellite.\n\nThe CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, which was emitted when the universe was about 380,000 years old. At that time, the universe had cooled down enough for the protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms, a process known as recombination. This allowed the photons to decouple from matter and travel freely through space, creating the CMB radiation that we observe today.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB and its near-uniformity across the sky provide crucial information about the early universe:\n\n1. The temperature confirms the Big Bang model: The CMB's temperature is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang model, which states that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n2. The temperature supports the theory of cosmic inflation: The near-uniformity of the CMB temperature across the sky supports the idea of cosmic inflation, a rapid expansion of the universe that occurred in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Inflation explains why the universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.\n\n3. The temperature helps determine the age of the universe: By measuring the temperature of the CMB and its tiny fluctuations, scientists can estimate the age of the universe, which is currently estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old.\n\n4. The temperature provides insights into the composition of the universe: The CMB temperature, along with its anisotropies (tiny fluctuations), helps determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. These measurements indicate that the universe is composed of roughly 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, 2.725 K, provides essential information about the early universe, confirming the Big Bang model, supporting the theory of cosmic inflation, and helping us understand the age and composition of the universe."
