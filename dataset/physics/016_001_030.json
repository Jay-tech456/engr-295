    "message_2": "The electron-phonon interaction strength is an essential factor in determining the critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor. In general, a stronger electron-phonon interaction leads to a higher critical temperature. This relationship can be described by the McMillan formula, which is derived from the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory of superconductivity:\n\nTc = (ħωD / 1.2kb) * exp(-1.04(1 + λ) / λ - μ*(1 + 0.62λ))\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature, ħωD is the Debye frequency, kb is the Boltzmann constant, λ is the electron-phonon coupling constant (interaction strength), and μ is the Coulomb repulsion parameter.\n\nTo investigate this relationship, we can analyze data from different types of superconductors:\n\n1. Conventional superconductors: These are mainly elemental metals and simple alloys, where the electron-phonon interaction is the primary mechanism for superconductivity. In these materials, the critical temperature is relatively low (usually below 30 K). The strong correlation between the electron-phonon interaction strength and Tc is evident in these superconductors.\n\n2. High-temperature superconductors (HTS): These are complex materials, such as cuprates and iron-based superconductors, with critical temperatures significantly higher than conventional superconductors (up to 138 K for cuprates). In these materials, the electron-phonon interaction is not the only factor contributing to superconductivity. Other interactions, such as spin fluctuations and orbital ordering, also play a crucial role. Therefore, the relationship between electron-phonon interaction strength and Tc is not as straightforward as in conventional superconductors.\n\n3. Heavy-fermion superconductors: These are intermetallic compounds containing elements with large atomic masses and partially filled f-electron shells, such as uranium or cerium. The electron-phonon interaction is generally weak in these materials, and other mechanisms, like the Kondo effect, contribute to superconductivity. The critical temperatures in heavy-fermion superconductors are typically low (below 10 K).\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between electron-phonon interaction strength and critical temperature is more evident in conventional superconductors. In other types of superconductors, like HTS and heavy-fermion materials, additional factors and interactions contribute to superconductivity, making the relationship less straightforward. Understanding these complex mechanisms is crucial for the development of new materials with higher critical temperatures and improved superconducting properties."
