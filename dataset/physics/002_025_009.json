    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the mixture, we need to find the heat capacities of ethylene glycol and water, and then combine them using the mass percentages.\n\nFirst, let's find the heat capacities of ethylene glycol and water. The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius. The specific heat capacity of ethylene glycol (C₂H₆O₂) is approximately 2.4 J/g°C, and the specific heat capacity of water (H₂O) is approximately 4.18 J/g°C.\n\nNow, let's assume we have a 100 g mixture of 30% ethylene glycol and 70% water. This means we have 30 g of ethylene glycol and 70 g of water.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the heat capacity of each component in the mixture:\n\nHeat capacity of ethylene glycol (Q₁) = mass × specific heat capacity\nQ₁ = 30 g × 2.4 J/g°C\nQ₁ = 72 J/°C\n\nHeat capacity of water (Q₂) = mass × specific heat capacity\nQ₂ = 70 g × 4.18 J/g°C\nQ₂ = 292.6 J/°C\n\nNow, we'll find the total heat capacity of the mixture (Q_total) by adding the heat capacities of ethylene glycol and water:\n\nQ_total = Q₁ + Q₂\nQ_total = 72 J/°C + 292.6 J/°C\nQ_total = 364.6 J/°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the mixture consisting of 30% ethylene glycol and 70% water is 364.6 J/°C."
