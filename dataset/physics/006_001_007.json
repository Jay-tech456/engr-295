    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of an electron in the hydrogen atom when it is in the n = 3 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / (3^2) = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the electron in the n = 3 energy level is approximately -1.51 eV.\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy required for the electron to move from the n = 3 to n = 4 energy level. First, we need to find the energy of the electron in the n = 4 energy level:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / (4^2) = -13.6 eV / 16 ≈ -0.85 eV\n\nThe energy required to move the electron from n = 3 to n = 4 is the difference between the energies of these two levels:\n\nΔE = E_4 - E_3 ≈ -0.85 eV - (-1.51 eV) ≈ 0.66 eV\n\nSo, the energy required for the electron to move from the n = 3 to n = 4 energy level is approximately 0.66 eV."
