    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and wavelength of the gravitational waves emitted by the two neutron stars, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Gravitational wave wavelength (λ): λ = c / f_GW\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars (in this case, their combined mass is 3 solar masses)\n- r is the distance between the neutron stars (300 km)\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, let's convert the combined mass of the neutron stars to kilograms:\n1 solar mass = 1.9885 × 10^30 kg\n3 solar masses = 3 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 5.9655 × 10^30 kg\n\nNext, let's convert the distance between the neutron stars to meters:\n300 km = 300,000 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the orbital frequency:\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt((6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.9655 × 10^30 kg) / (300,000 m)^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 48.5 Hz\n\nThe gravitational wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency:\nf_GW = 2 * 48.5 Hz = 97 Hz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the gravitational wave wavelength:\nλ = (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s) / 97 Hz ≈ 3.09 × 10^6 m\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the two neutron stars is approximately 97 Hz, and the wavelength is approximately 3.09 × 10^6 meters."
