    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire with dimensions 10 cm x 5 cm carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnetic field at a point 4 cm above the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop has a rectangular shape, we need to break it down into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields from all four segments to find the total magnetic field at the given point.\n\nLet's denote the four segments as follows:\n1. Top segment (length = 10 cm)\n2. Bottom segment (length = 10 cm)\n3. Left segment (length = 5 cm)\n4. Right segment (length = 5 cm)\n\nFor each segment, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * d) / (4 * π * (d² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), d is the distance from the wire to the point, and x is the perpendicular distance from the point to the wire.\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the distance d is 4 cm, and the perpendicular distance x is half the length of the segment (5 cm). For the left and right segments, the distance d is 4 cm, and the perpendicular distance x is half the length of the segment (2.5 cm).\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field contributions from each segment:\n\nB_top = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.04 m) / (4 * π * (0.04^2 + 0.05^2)^(3/2)) = 1.60 × 10^(-6) T\nB_bottom = B_top (due to symmetry)\n\nB_left = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.04 m) / (4 * π * (0.04^2 + 0.025^2)^(3/2)) = 2.56 × 10^(-6) T\nB_right = B_left (due to symmetry)\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields from all four segments to find the total magnetic field at the given point:\n\nB_total = B_top + B_bottom + B_left + B_right = 1.60 × 10^(-6) T + 1.60 × 10^(-6) T + 2.56 × 10^(-6) T + 2.56 × 10^(-6) T = 8.32 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 4 cm above the center of the loop is approximately 8.32 × 10^(-6) T."
