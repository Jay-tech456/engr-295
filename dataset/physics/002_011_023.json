    "message_2": "In an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer between the system (the gas) and its surroundings. The work done by the gas during the process can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index or the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv) of the gas. For an ideal diatomic gas, γ is approximately 1.4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the final pressure P2. We can use the adiabatic process equation:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nGiven the initial pressure P1 = 1 atm and the initial volume V1 = 10 L, and the final volume V2 = 2 L, we can solve for P2:\n\n1 * (10)^1.4 = P2 * (2)^1.4\n\nP2 = (10^1.4) / (2^1.4) = 5.179474 atm\n\nNow we can calculate the work done by the gas:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\nW = (1 * 10 - 5.179474 * 2) / (1.4 - 1)\nW = (10 - 10.358948) / 0.4\nW = -0.358948 / 0.4\nW ≈ -0.89737 L*atm\n\nSince the work done is negative, it means that the gas has done work on the piston (compression).\n\nTo convert the work done from L*atm to Joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 L*atm = 101.325 J:\n\nW ≈ -0.89737 L*atm * (101.325 J / 1 L*atm)\nW ≈ -90.87 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the adiabatic process is approximately -90.87 Joules."
