    "message_2": "The predicted mass range for sterile neutrinos to account for the observed dark matter content of the universe is typically in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) scale. More specifically, the mass range is expected to be between 1 keV and 50 keV. Sterile neutrinos in this mass range are often referred to as \"warm dark matter\" candidates.\n\nDetecting sterile neutrinos is challenging because they only interact with other particles through gravity and possibly through mixing with active neutrinos. One possible way to detect them is through their decay modes. A sterile neutrino can decay into an active neutrino and a photon. The decay rate is generally very slow, but if the sterile neutrino is a dark matter candidate, the decay could produce an observable X-ray signal.\n\nAstrophysical X-ray observatories, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, and future missions like Athena, can search for this X-ray signal. The detection of a monochromatic X-ray line at the energy corresponding to half the mass of the sterile neutrino, with no known astrophysical source, would be a strong indication of the existence of sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates.\n\nAnother approach to detect sterile neutrinos is through their impact on the large-scale structure of the universe. The distribution of dark matter in the universe affects the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure surveys, and the Lyman-alpha forest can provide constraints on the properties of sterile neutrinos and their role in dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range for sterile neutrinos to account for the observed dark matter content of the universe is between 1 keV and 50 keV. Detection of such neutrinos could be possible through their decay modes, producing an observable X-ray signal, or by studying their impact on the large-scale structure of the universe."
