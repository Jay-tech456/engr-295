    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to calculate the vapor pressure of water at a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius, given that the vapor pressure at 25 degrees Celsius is 3.17 kPa and the enthalpy of vaporization for water is 40.7 kJ/mol. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, what is the vapor pressure of water at 75 degrees Celsius?",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given:\nP1 = 3.17 kPa (vapor pressure at 25°C)\nT1 = 25°C = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nP2 = ? (vapor pressure at 75°C)\nT2 = 75°C = 75 + 273.15 = 348.15 K\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40.7 * 10^3 J/mol\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/3.17) = -(40.7 * 10^3)/(8.314) * (1/348.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 3.17 * exp(-(40.7 * 10^3)/(8.314) * (1/348.15 - 1/298.15))\nP2 ≈ 12.27 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 75 degrees Celsius is approximately 12.27 kPa."
