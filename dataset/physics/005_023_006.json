    "message_1": "What is the maximum possible mass of a black hole that could exist in our universe according to the theory of special relativity, and how does this relate to the concept of the Schwarzschild radius?",
    "message_2": "The theory of special relativity does not place a limit on the maximum possible mass of a black hole. However, the theory of general relativity, which deals with gravity and the curvature of spacetime, is more relevant to black holes.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is a concept derived from general relativity and is used to describe the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, not even light. The Schwarzschild radius is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThere is no theoretical upper limit on the mass of a black hole according to general relativity. However, there are practical limits based on the age and size of the observable universe. The most massive black holes observed so far are several billion solar masses, but there could be even more massive black holes that we have not yet detected.\n\nIt is important to note that the larger the mass of a black hole, the larger its Schwarzschild radius will be. This means that the event horizon will be farther from the black hole's center, and the black hole will appear larger in size."
