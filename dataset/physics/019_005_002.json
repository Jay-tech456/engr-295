    "message_2": "To calculate the decay rate (Γ) of a spin-0 particle decaying into two spin-1/2 particles via a scalar coupling in quantum field theory, we can use the formula:\n\nΓ = (λ² / 8π) * (m₀ / M) * √(1 - 4m² / M²)\n\nwhere:\n- λ is the scalar coupling constant\n- m₀ is the mass of the spin-0 particle (100 GeV)\n- M is the sum of the masses of the two spin-1/2 particles (5 GeV + 95 GeV)\n- m is the reduced mass of the two spin-1/2 particles, given by m = (m₁ * m₂) / (m₁ + m₂), where m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two spin-1/2 particles (5 GeV and 95 GeV)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced mass (m):\n\nm = (5 GeV * 95 GeV) / (5 GeV + 95 GeV)\nm ≈ 4.76 GeV\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the decay rate formula. Note that we don't have the value of the scalar coupling constant (λ), so we'll leave it as a variable:\n\nΓ = (λ² / 8π) * (100 GeV / 100 GeV) * √(1 - 4 * (4.76 GeV)² / (100 GeV)²)\nΓ = (λ² / 8π) * √(1 - 4 * (4.76 GeV)² / (100 GeV)²)\n\nCalculating the value inside the square root:\n\n1 - 4 * (4.76 GeV)² / (100 GeV)² ≈ 0.8104\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nΓ = (λ² / 8π) * √0.8104\nΓ ≈ (λ² / 8π) * 0.9002\n\nSo, the decay rate of the spin-0 particle with a mass of 100 GeV decaying into two spin-1/2 particles with masses of 5 GeV and 95 GeV respectively via a scalar coupling in quantum field theory is approximately:\n\nΓ ≈ (λ² / 8π) * 0.9002\n\nThis result depends on the scalar coupling constant λ, which is not provided. If you have the value of λ, you can plug it into the formula to get the numerical value of the decay rate."
