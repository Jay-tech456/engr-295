    "message_1": "A spacecraft moves relative to Earth with a velocity of 0.8c. If the time on the spacecraft's clock measures 2 days, how much time has elapsed on Earth during that period according to an observer on the spacecraft? (Assume Earth is at rest and there is no acceleration involved.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time elapsed on Earth (the time measured by an observer at rest relative to Earth),\nΔt0 is the time elapsed on the spacecraft (the proper time),\nv is the relative velocity between the spacecraft and Earth,\nc is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\nΔt0 = 2 days,\nv = 0.8c.\n\nWe need to find Δt.\n\nPlugging the given values into the time dilation equation:\n\nΔt = 2 days / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nΔt = 2 days / √(1 - 0.64)\nΔt = 2 days / √(0.36)\nΔt = 2 days / 0.6\nΔt ≈ 3.33 days\n\nSo, according to an observer on the spacecraft, approximately 3.33 days have elapsed on Earth during the 2 days measured by the spacecraft's clock."
