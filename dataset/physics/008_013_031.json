    "message_2": "The tau lepton is the heaviest of the three charged leptons, which also include the muon and the electron. The mass of a tau lepton is approximately 1.7768 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), which is significantly heavier than the muon (approximately 0.1057 GeV/c²) and the electron (approximately 0.000511 GeV/c²).\n\nThe lifetime of a tau lepton is very short, approximately 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds. This is shorter than the lifetime of a muon, which is around 2.2 x 10^(-6) seconds. The electron, on the other hand, is considered stable and does not decay.\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton is the heaviest and has the shortest lifetime among the three charged leptons. The muon is lighter and has a longer lifetime, while the electron is the lightest and considered stable."
