    "message_2": "As of now, there is no direct experimental evidence supporting supersymmetry (SUSY) as a theory describing the fundamental constituents of matter. Supersymmetry is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics, postulating that each particle in the Standard Model has a supersymmetric partner with different spin properties. SUSY is an attractive theory because it can potentially solve several issues in the Standard Model, such as the hierarchy problem and the unification of forces.\n\nHowever, despite its theoretical appeal, experimental evidence for supersymmetry has not been found. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been searching for signs of supersymmetry in high-energy collisions, but so far, no clear signals of SUSY particles have been observed. Some specific examples of experiments that have searched for supersymmetry include:\n\n1. ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC: These two general-purpose detectors have been searching for supersymmetric particles in various decay channels and production modes. They have set stringent limits on the masses of supersymmetric particles, such as gluinos, squarks, and neutralinos, but have not observed any direct evidence for their existence.\n\n2. LHCb experiment at the LHC: This experiment focuses on the study of particles containing bottom quarks, which can provide indirect evidence for supersymmetry through rare decays and flavor-changing processes. So far, the results are consistent with the Standard Model predictions, and no clear signs of SUSY have been found.\n\n3. Dark matter searches: Supersymmetry predicts the existence of a stable, neutral, and weakly interacting particle called the neutralino, which could be a candidate for dark matter. Experiments such as XENON1T, LUX, and DarkSide have been searching for direct evidence of dark matter particles through their interactions with ordinary matter. However, these experiments have not yet detected any dark matter particles, and the limits they set on the properties of dark matter candidates are becoming increasingly stringent.\n\nIn summary, despite extensive searches at the LHC and other experiments, no direct or indirect evidence for supersymmetry has been found so far. This does not necessarily disprove the theory, but it does constrain the parameter space for supersymmetric models and pushes the expected masses of SUSY particles to higher values. As a result, researchers continue to explore alternative models and extensions of the Standard Model that can address its shortcomings without relying on supersymmetry."
