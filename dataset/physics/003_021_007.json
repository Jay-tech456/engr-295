    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil with 200 turns and a secondary coil with 800 turns. If the primary coil is supplied with a current of 2 A, what is the magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil assuming the transformer is ideal and neglecting any losses?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil, we first need to determine the current in the secondary coil. Since the transformer is ideal and neglecting any losses, we can use the transformer equation:\n\nN_primary / N_secondary = I_secondary / I_primary\n\nwhere N_primary and N_secondary are the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils, respectively, and I_primary and I_secondary are the currents in the primary and secondary coils, respectively.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for I_secondary:\n\nI_secondary = (N_secondary / N_primary) * I_primary\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nI_secondary = (800 turns / 200 turns) * 2 A\nI_secondary = 4 * 2 A\nI_secondary = 8 A\n\nNow that we have the current in the secondary coil, we can find the magnetic field strength (B) at the center of the secondary coil using Ampere's Law for a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current in the coil.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine the number of turns per unit length (n) for the secondary coil. If we knew the length of the secondary coil, we could calculate n and then find the magnetic field strength at the center of the secondary coil."
