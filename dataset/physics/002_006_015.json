    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nGiven that the standard molar enthalpy of combustion (ΔH) for methane is -890.4 kJ/mol, the temperature (T) is 298 K, and the standard molar entropy (ΔS) is 186.2 J/K•mol, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-890.4 kJ/mol) - (298 K)(186.2 J/K•mol)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy from J/K•mol to kJ/K•mol:\n\n186.2 J/K•mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.1862 kJ/K•mol\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-890.4 kJ/mol) - (298 K)(0.1862 kJ/K•mol)\n\nΔG = (-890.4 kJ/mol) - (55.6 kJ/mol)\n\nΔG = -946 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of 1 mole of methane at 298 K and 1 atm of pressure is approximately -946 kJ/mol."
