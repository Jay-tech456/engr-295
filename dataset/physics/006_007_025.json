    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, an electric current is passed through a low-pressure gas (in this case, neon) in a discharge tube. The applied voltage affects the current in the tube in a specific manner, which can be understood by considering the energy levels of the gas atoms and the electron collisions that occur within the tube.\n\nWhen a voltage is applied across the tube, electrons are accelerated from the cathode towards the anode. As the electrons gain kinetic energy, they collide with the neon gas atoms. If the kinetic energy of the electrons is below the energy required to excite the neon atoms (which is about 18.7 eV for the first excited state), the collisions will be elastic, and the electrons will continue to gain energy as they move towards the anode.\n\nAs the applied voltage is increased, the electrons gain more kinetic energy, and when their energy is sufficient to excite the neon atoms, inelastic collisions occur. In these collisions, the electrons transfer their energy to the neon atoms, causing them to become excited. The electrons lose most of their kinetic energy in the process and are no longer able to reach the anode, leading to a decrease in the current.\n\nAfter the excitation, the neon atoms return to their ground state by emitting photons, which is observed as the characteristic glow in the discharge tube.\n\nAs the applied voltage is further increased, the electrons gain enough energy to excite the neon atoms again after a subsequent collision. This leads to a series of peaks and valleys in the current-voltage curve, which correspond to the energy levels of the neon atoms.\n\nIn summary, the applied voltage in the Franck-Hertz experiment using a neon gas discharge tube affects the current by controlling the kinetic energy of the electrons. When the electrons have sufficient energy to excite the neon atoms, inelastic collisions occur, leading to a decrease in the current. As the voltage is increased, a series of peaks and valleys in the current-voltage curve are observed, which correspond to the energy levels of the neon atoms."
