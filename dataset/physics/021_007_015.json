    "message_2": "Black holes affect the trajectory and gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies through their immense gravitational force. This force is a result of the black hole's mass being compressed into an incredibly small volume, creating a region of spacetime with a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape it.\n\nThe gravitational force exerted by a black hole on nearby celestial bodies depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole and the celestial body. The closer a celestial body is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational force it experiences.\n\n1. Stars: If a star is close enough to a black hole, it can be pulled into an orbit around the black hole. This can lead to the formation of a binary system, where the star and black hole orbit each other. Over time, the black hole can strip away the outer layers of the star, eventually consuming it entirely. If the star is farther away, its trajectory may be altered by the black hole's gravity, causing it to move in a different direction or change its orbit.\n\n2. Planets: Planets can also be affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole. If a planet is close enough, it can be pulled into an orbit around the black hole, similar to a star. This can lead to the planet being stripped of its atmosphere and eventually consumed by the black hole. If the planet is farther away, its orbit around its parent star can be altered, potentially causing it to be ejected from the star system or collide with another celestial body.\n\n3. Asteroids: Asteroids can be significantly affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole. If an asteroid passes close enough to a black hole, it can be pulled into an orbit around the black hole or even be consumed by it. The black hole's gravity can also cause the asteroid's trajectory to change, potentially sending it on a collision course with another celestial body or ejecting it from its star system.\n\nIn summary, black holes can have a significant impact on the trajectory and gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies, including stars, planets, and asteroids. The closer a celestial body is to the black hole, the more significant the effects of the black hole's gravity will be."
