    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system just before the merger, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (8 * π * G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere:\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational waves\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes in the binary system\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 35 solar masses = 35 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 6.9615 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (8 * π * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^31 kg + 6.9615 x 10^31 kg))\nf ≈ 1.52 x 10^4 Hz\n\nThe predicted frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system just before the merger is approximately 15.2 kHz."
