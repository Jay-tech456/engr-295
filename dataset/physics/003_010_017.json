    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance \"r\" from the center of a cylindrical wire with radius \"a\" and current \"I\" flowing through it, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when r < a (i.e., the point is inside the wire). We will choose a circular Amperian loop with radius r, centered on the wire's axis. The magnetic field at this distance will be tangential to the loop. Therefore, the line integral of the magnetic field can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nSince the point is inside the wire, we need to find the current enclosed by the Amperian loop. We can do this by finding the current density (J) of the wire. Assuming the current is uniformly distributed across the wire's cross-sectional area, we have:\n\nJ = I / (πa²)\n\nThe enclosed current (I_enclosed) can be found by multiplying the current density by the area enclosed by the Amperian loop:\n\nI_enclosed = J * πr² = (I / πa²) * πr²\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * (I / πa²) * πr²\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πa²)\n\nNow, let's consider the case when r ≥ a (i.e., the point is outside the wire). In this case, the Amperian loop encloses the entire current of the wire:\n\nI_enclosed = I\n\nThe line integral of the magnetic field is still:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nUsing Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nIn summary, the magnetic field at a distance \"r\" from the center of a cylindrical wire with radius \"a\" and current \"I\" flowing through it is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πa²) for r < a (inside the wire)\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr) for r ≥ a (outside the wire)"
