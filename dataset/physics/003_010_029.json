    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the center of a cylindrical conductor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nFor a cylindrical conductor, the magnetic field strength at a distance r from the center is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field strength,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current in the conductor (5 A),\nr is the distance from the center of the conductor (10 cm = 0.1 m).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 10 μT\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the cylindrical conductor is 10 μT (microteslas)."
