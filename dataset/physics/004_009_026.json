    "message_2": "In General Relativity, the Kerr metric is used to describe the spacetime geometry around a rotating black hole. The rotation of the black hole introduces some interesting effects on the outer event horizon compared to a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole.\n\n1. Shape: The event horizon of a rotating black hole is not a perfect sphere, as it is in the case of a non-rotating black hole. Instead, it is oblate, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This is due to the frame-dragging effect caused by the rotation of the black hole, which distorts the spacetime around it.\n\n2. Size: The size of the outer event horizon is also affected by the rotation of the black hole. For a given mass, a faster rotation will cause the event horizon to shrink, making the black hole appear smaller. This is because the centrifugal force caused by the rotation counteracts the gravitational force, effectively reducing the gravitational pull at the equator.\n\n3. Ergosphere: A unique feature of a rotating black hole is the presence of an ergosphere, which is a region outside the event horizon where the frame-dragging effect is so strong that all objects, including light, are forced to move in the direction of the black hole's rotation. The boundary of the ergosphere is called the \"static limit,\" and it is where the rotational velocity of spacetime equals the speed of light. The ergosphere is not present in a non-rotating black hole.\n\nIn summary, the rotation of a black hole, as described by the Kerr metric, affects the shape, size, and spacetime structure of the outer event horizon, leading to an oblate event horizon, a smaller size for a given mass, and the presence of an ergosphere."
