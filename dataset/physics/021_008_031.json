    "message_2": "To calculate the expected gravitational wave frequency range emitted by a black hole merger, we first need to find the characteristic frequency of the system. The characteristic frequency (f) is given by the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * π)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes in kilograms, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 40 solar masses = 40 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 7.956 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for the characteristic frequency:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / [(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^31 kg + 7.956 x 10^31 kg) * π]\nf ≈ 76.6 Hz\n\nThe frequency range of the emitted gravitational waves will be centered around this characteristic frequency. The exact range depends on the specific details of the merger, but it is typically within a few tens of Hertz of the characteristic frequency.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected amplitude of the resulting gravitational waves at a distance of 1 megaparsec. The amplitude (h) is given by the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * c^2) / (D * c^4)\n\nwhere M_chirp is the chirp mass of the system, given by:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^0.6 / (M1 + M2)^0.2\n\nand D is the distance to the system in meters. One megaparsec is approximately 3.086 x 10^22 meters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (5.967 x 10^31 kg * 7.956 x 10^31 kg)^0.6 / (5.967 x 10^31 kg + 7.956 x 10^31 kg)^0.2\nM_chirp ≈ 6.106 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula for the amplitude:\n\nh = (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 6.106 x 10^31 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) / (3.086 x 10^22 m * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^4)\nh ≈ 1.34 x 10^-22\n\nThe expected amplitude of the resulting gravitational waves at a distance of 1 megaparsec is approximately 1.34 x 10^-22."
