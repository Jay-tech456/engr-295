    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer on a flat plate, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U₀)^0.5)\n\nwhere:\n- x is the distance along the plate (in this case, 1 meter)\n- ν is the kinematic viscosity (1.5 x 10^-5 m^2/s)\n- U₀ is the free-stream velocity (20 m/s)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (5 * 1 * (1.5 x 10^-5 / 20)^0.5)\nδ = (5 * (7.5 x 10^-6)^0.5)\nδ = 5 * 0.0027386\nδ ≈ 0.013693 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer on the flat plate is approximately 0.013693 meters or 13.693 mm."
