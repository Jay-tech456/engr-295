    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outer space that travel through the Earth's atmosphere. There is a hypothesis that cosmic rays may influence cloud formation, which in turn could affect the Earth's climate. The idea is that cosmic rays can ionize molecules in the atmosphere, creating charged particles that can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). These CCN can then lead to the formation of clouds, which play a significant role in the Earth's climate by reflecting sunlight and affecting the overall energy balance.\n\nSeveral research studies and experiments have been conducted to investigate the possible link between cosmic rays and cloud formation. One of the most notable experiments is the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) project at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The CLOUD experiment uses a controlled chamber to study the effect of cosmic rays on aerosol particles and cloud formation under various atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe results from the CLOUD experiment have provided some evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays can influence cloud formation. For example, a study published in 2016 by Kirkby et al. found that the ionization of the atmosphere by cosmic rays can enhance the production of aerosol particles, which can then act as CCN. This effect was found to be more significant in the pre-industrial-like conditions, where the concentration of aerosols was lower than in the present-day atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the magnitude of the cosmic ray effect on cloud formation and its potential impact on climate change remains uncertain. Some studies suggest that the cosmic ray-cloud connection could have a minor influence on the Earth's climate. For instance, a study by Erlykin et al. (2013) concluded that the contribution of cosmic rays to global warming is less than 0.1Â°C, which is relatively small compared to the overall warming observed in the past century.\n\nIn summary, there is evidence suggesting that cosmic rays can influence cloud formation, but the extent to which this affects climate change on Earth is still uncertain. More research is needed to better understand the complex interactions between cosmic rays, cloud formation, and the Earth's climate system."
