How does the flow velocity vary with the radius of the pipe? How does the volumetric flow rate depend on the pressure difference and the viscosity of the fluid?",
    "message_2": "The solution to the Navier-Stokes equation for laminar flow in a circular pipe with a constant pressure difference between the ends is known as the Hagen-Poiseuille flow or Poiseuille's law. The flow velocity profile is parabolic, and the volumetric flow rate depends on the pressure difference and the viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe flow velocity (v) varies with the radius of the pipe (r) according to the following equation:\n\nv(r) = (ΔP / 4μL) * (R^2 - r^2)\n\nwhere:\n- v(r) is the flow velocity at a radial distance r from the center of the pipe\n- ΔP is the pressure difference between the ends of the pipe\n- μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid\n- L is the length of the pipe\n- R is the radius of the pipe\n\nThe flow velocity is maximum at the center of the pipe (r = 0) and decreases to zero at the pipe wall (r = R).\n\nThe volumetric flow rate (Q) depends on the pressure difference and the viscosity of the fluid as follows:\n\nQ = (πR^4ΔP) / (8μL)\n\nwhere:\n- Q is the volumetric flow rate\n- π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)\n- R, ΔP, μ, and L are as defined above\n\nThis equation shows that the volumetric flow rate is directly proportional to the pressure difference and the fourth power of the pipe radius, and inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity and the pipe length."
