    "message_2": "To find the length of the object as observed by the observer on the ground, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length when stationary), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, L0 = 20 meters and v = 0.6c.\n\nL = 20 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nL = 20 * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nL = 20 * sqrt(0.64)\nL = 20 * 0.8\nL = 16 meters\n\nSo, the length of the object moving at 0.6c relative to an observer on the ground is 16 meters."
