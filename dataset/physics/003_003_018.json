    "message_1": "A circular toroid has 500 turns and an inner radius of 10 cm and an outer radius of 15 cm. If a current of 2 A flows through the toroid, what is the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the toroid? (Assume that the toroid is wound uniformly and the magnetic permeability of the core is constant)",
    "message_2": "The magnetic field inside a toroid is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the toroid.\n\nHowever, the point in question is located at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the toroid, which is outside the inner radius (10 cm) but inside the outer radius (15 cm). In this case, the magnetic field at this point is not given by the formula above, as it is not inside the toroid.\n\nTo find the magnetic field at this point, we need to use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field due to a small current element is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r') / (4 * π * |r'|³)\n\nwhere dB is the magnetic field due to the small current element, dl is the length of the current element, and r' is the vector from the current element to the point of interest.\n\nSince the toroid is symmetric, the magnetic field at the point on the axis will be the sum of the magnetic fields due to all the current elements in the toroid. We can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire toroid to find the total magnetic field at the point:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl × r') / (4 * π * |r'|³)\n\nHowever, this integral is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques to solve. In general, the magnetic field at a point outside the inner radius but inside the outer radius of a toroid is not easily determined using simple formulas. It would require numerical methods or specialized software to find the magnetic field at this specific point."
