Provide a mathematical expression for calculating the Coriolis force on an object in motion within the ocean. Use this equation to explain why ocean currents in the Northern hemisphere are deflected to the right and currents in the Southern hemisphere are deflected to the left.",
    "message_2": "The Coriolis force is an apparent force that acts on a mass moving in a rotating system, such as Earth's rotation. It is an inertial force described mathematically by the Coriolis effect. The Coriolis force affects the movement of ocean currents by causing the water to be deflected as it moves across Earth's surface due to the planet's rotation.\n\nThe mathematical expression for calculating the Coriolis force (F_c) on an object in motion within the ocean is:\n\nF_c = 2 * m * v * ω * sin(Φ)\n\nwhere:\n- m is the mass of the object (in kg)\n- v is the velocity of the object (in m/s)\n- ω is the angular velocity of Earth's rotation (approximately 7.292 x 10^-5 rad/s)\n- Φ is the latitude of the object (in radians)\n\nThe Coriolis force causes moving objects to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This can be explained using the equation for the Coriolis force.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the latitude (Φ) is positive, which means that the sine of the latitude (sin(Φ)) is also positive. Therefore, the Coriolis force (F_c) is positive, causing the object to be deflected to the right.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the latitude (Φ) is negative, which means that the sine of the latitude (sin(Φ)) is also negative. Therefore, the Coriolis force (F_c) is negative, causing the object to be deflected to the left.\n\nThis deflection due to the Coriolis force is responsible for the characteristic clockwise rotation of ocean currents in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere."
