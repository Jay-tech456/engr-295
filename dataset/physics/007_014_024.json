    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear binding energy per nucleon, we first need to find the mass defect and then convert it into energy using Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2. Finally, we will divide the total binding energy by the total number of nucleons to get the binding energy per nucleon.\n\n1. Calculate the mass defect:\nMass defect = (Z * mass of proton + N * mass of neutron) - mass of nucleus\nwhere Z is the proton number, N is the neutron number, and mass of nucleus is the actual mass of the nucleus.\n\nGiven, Z = 8 (proton number) and N = 8 (neutron number)\nMass of proton = 1.007276466812 u\nMass of neutron = 1.008664915 u\n\nMass defect = (8 * 1.007276466812 u + 8 * 1.008664915 u) - mass of nucleus\n\nTo find the mass of the nucleus, we can look up the atomic mass of the element with 8 protons, which is oxygen. The isotope with 8 neutrons is Oxygen-16, and its atomic mass is approximately 15.99491461957 u.\n\nMass defect = (8 * 1.007276466812 u + 8 * 1.008664915 u) - 15.99491461957 u\nMass defect = 8.058211734496 u + 8.06931932 u - 15.99491461957 u\nMass defect = 0.132616434926 u\n\n2. Convert mass defect into energy:\nE = mc^2\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u = 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.132616434926 u * 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg/u\nMass defect in kg = 2.202255754 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\nE = (2.202255754 x 10^-28 kg) * (2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.971454 x 10^-11 Joules\n\n3. Calculate the binding energy per nucleon:\nTotal nucleons = Z + N = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nBinding energy per nucleon = (1.971454 x 10^-11 Joules) / 16\nBinding energy per nucleon = 1.232159 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nSo, the nuclear binding energy per nucleon for a nucleus with a proton number of 8 and a neutron number of 8 is approximately 1.232159 x 10^-12 Joules."
