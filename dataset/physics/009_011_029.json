    "message_1": "A lens has a focal length of 30 cm and its refractive index is 1.5. If the radius of one surface of the lens is 12 cm, what is the radius of the other surface?",
    "message_2": "To find the radius of the other surface, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * [(1/R1) - (1/R2)]\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R1 is the radius of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of the second surface.\n\nWe are given f = 30 cm, n = 1.5, and R1 = 12 cm. We need to find R2.\n\n(1/30) = (1.5-1) * [(1/12) - (1/R2)]\n\n(1/30) = 0.5 * [(1/12) - (1/R2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for R2:\n\n1/R2 = (1/12) - (1/30) * 2\n\n1/R2 = (1/12) - (1/15)\n\nTo find the common denominator, we can multiply the denominators (12 and 15):\n\n1/R2 = (15 - 12) / (12 * 15)\n\n1/R2 = 3 / 180\n\n1/R2 = 1 / 60\n\nNow, we can find R2 by taking the reciprocal:\n\nR2 = 60 cm\n\nSo, the radius of the other surface of the lens is 60 cm."
