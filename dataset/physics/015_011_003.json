    "message_2": "The expected rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the types of sources being observed, and the overall advancement in detection techniques. As the sensitivity of detectors improves, the detection rate is expected to increase significantly.\n\nCurrently, the primary observatories for detecting gravitational waves are the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer. These observatories have already made several groundbreaking detections, primarily from binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers. The detection rate for these events has been increasing as the detectors have been upgraded.\n\nFor instance, during LIGO's first observing run (O1) in 2015-2016, there were only a few detections. However, during the second observing run (O2) in 2016-2017, the detection rate increased, and it increased even further during the third observing run (O3) in 2019-2020. This trend is expected to continue as the sensitivity of the detectors improves.\n\nFuture observatories, such as the upcoming LIGO-India, the Einstein Telescope, and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are expected to have even greater sensitivities, which will allow them to detect gravitational waves from a wider range of sources and at greater distances. This will lead to a significant increase in the detection rate.\n\nThe exact detection rate depends on the specific sensitivity of the detectors and the types of sources being observed. However, it is estimated that with the next generation of ground-based detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, the detection rate could be as high as several tens to hundreds of events per year for binary black hole mergers and several events per year for binary neutron star mergers.\n\nFor space-based detectors like LISA, which will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, the detection rate could be even higher, with potentially thousands of events per year from sources such as supermassive black hole mergers and compact binary systems in our galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the expected rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories will increase significantly as the sensitivity of the detectors improves. This will allow scientists to observe a wider range of sources and gain valuable insights into the nature of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics."
