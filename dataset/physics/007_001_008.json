    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of fuel required per day, we need to use the famous equation by Albert Einstein, E=mc^2, where E is the energy produced, m is the mass of the fuel, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the power generated (1000 MW) to energy per day. \n\n1 MW = 1 x 10^6 W\n\n1000 MW = 1000 x 10^6 W\n\nEnergy per day = Power x Time\n\nTime = 24 hours = 24 x 60 x 60 seconds (since we need to convert hours to seconds)\n\nEnergy per day = 1000 x 10^6 W x 24 x 60 x 60 s = 8.64 x 10^13 Joules\n\nNow, we know that the efficiency of conversion of mass to energy is 0.1%. Therefore, only 0.1% of the fuel mass is converted into energy. \n\nEnergy produced = Efficiency x (mc^2)\n\n8.64 x 10^13 J = 0.001 x m x (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\n8.64 x 10^13 J = 0.001 x m x 9 x 10^16 J/kg\n\nTo find the mass of the fuel (m), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nm = (8.64 x 10^13 J) / (0.001 x 9 x 10^16 J/kg)\n\nm â‰ˆ 9.6 x 10^2 kg\n\nSo, the amount of fuel required per day is approximately 960 kg."
