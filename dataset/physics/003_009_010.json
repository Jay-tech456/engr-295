    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dL is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nHowever, since we have a sphere carrying a current, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by each small segment of the sphere. To do this, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the total length of the wire on the sphere. The sphere can be considered as a collection of circular loops, each with a different radius (r') and carrying the same current. The total length of the wire (L) is the sum of the circumferences of all these loops:\n\nL = ∫(2 * π * r') dr'\n\nSince the sphere has a radius of 0.1 meters, we integrate from 0 to 0.1:\n\nL = ∫(2 * π * r') dr' from 0 to 0.1 = π * (0.1^2 - 0^2) = 0.01π meters\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the sphere. We can consider a small segment of the wire with length dL, located at a distance r' from the center of the sphere. The distance from this segment to the point where we want to find the magnetic field is r = 0.05 meters.\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nSince the current is distributed uniformly over the sphere, the current in each small segment is proportional to the length of the segment:\n\nI_segment = I * (dL / L)\n\nSubstituting this expression into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * (dL / L) * r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire sphere to find the total magnetic field:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = ∫((μ₀ * I * (dL / L) * r) / (4 * π * r^3))\n\nSince μ₀, I, and L are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * L) * ∫(r * dL / r^3)\n\nThe integral ∫(r * dL / r^3) represents the sum of the contributions of all the small segments of the wire to the magnetic field. Since the sphere is symmetric, the magnetic field at the point 0.05 meters from the center will be the same for all segments, and we can simplify the integral:\n\n∫(r * dL / r^3) = (1 / r^2) * ∫(dL) = (1 / r^2) * L\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * L) * ((1 / r^2) * L)\n\nThe L terms cancel out:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and r:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (4 * π * (0.05 m)^2) = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (π * 0.0025 m^2)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nB ≈ (12 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.0025 m^2) = 4.8 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the sphere is approximately 4.8 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
