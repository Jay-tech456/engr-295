    "message_2": "Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects. In the context of collapsing stars, these objects are typically neutron stars or black holes. The gravitational wave pattern produced by a collapsing star depends on its mass distribution and rotation. Here, we will compare and contrast the gravitational wave patterns produced by a non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star and a rotating, oblate spheroid collapsing star.\n\n1. Frequency:\n- Non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star: In this case, the star's mass distribution is symmetric, and there is no rotation. As a result, the gravitational wave frequency produced by such a star is relatively low. This is because the quadrupole moment (a measure of the mass distribution's deviation from spherical symmetry) remains constant, and the rate of change of the quadrupole moment is directly related to the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n- Rotating, oblate spheroid collapsing star: In contrast, a rotating star has an oblate shape due to its centrifugal force, leading to a higher quadrupole moment. The rotation causes the quadrupole moment to change more rapidly, resulting in a higher frequency of emitted gravitational waves.\n\n2. Amplitude:\n- Non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star: The amplitude of gravitational waves depends on the mass distribution and its acceleration. In this case, the symmetric mass distribution results in a relatively low amplitude of gravitational waves, as the acceleration of mass is not as pronounced.\n- Rotating, oblate spheroid collapsing star: The oblate shape and rotation of the star lead to a more pronounced acceleration of mass, resulting in a higher amplitude of gravitational waves.\n\n3. Polarization:\n- Non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star: Gravitational waves have two polarization states, \"+\" and \"x.\" For a non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star, the emitted gravitational waves have a very weak polarization, as the symmetric mass distribution does not favor any particular polarization state.\n- Rotating, oblate spheroid collapsing star: The rotating star's oblate shape and non-symmetric mass distribution lead to a more pronounced polarization of the emitted gravitational waves. The polarization state depends on the orientation of the star's rotation axis relative to the observer.\n\nIn summary, a rotating, oblate spheroid collapsing star produces gravitational waves with higher frequency, amplitude, and polarization compared to a non-rotating, spherically symmetric collapsing star. The differences in the gravitational wave patterns can provide valuable information about the properties of the collapsing stars, such as their mass distribution and rotation."
