    "message_2": "To find the position of the image, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = 10 cm and u = 20 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/20\n1/v = (2 - 1)/20\n1/v = 1/20\n\nSo, v = 20 cm\n\nThe position of the image is 20 cm from the lens on the opposite side of the object.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (m), we can use the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nm = -20/20\nm = -1\n\nThe magnification is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
