    "message_2": "To ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state, the energy of the incoming photon must be equal to or greater than the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom. The ionization energy of hydrogen is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state (n=1) to infinity (n=âˆž). This energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/n^2)\n\nFor the ground state (n=1), the ionization energy is:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nSince we are looking for the energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom, we need the absolute value of this energy:\n\nE = 13.6 eV\n\nNow, we can convert this energy to joules:\n\nE = 13.6 eV * (1.6 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.18 * 10^-18 J\n\nNext, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation to find the minimum frequency of light required to ionize the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = h * f\n\nWhere E is the ionization energy, h is the Planck constant (6.63 * 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency. Solving for f, we get:\n\nf = E / h = (2.18 * 10^-18 J) / (6.63 * 10^-34 Js) = 3.29 * 10^15 Hz\n\nSo, the minimum frequency of light required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 3.29 * 10^15 Hz, and the corresponding ionization energy is 13.6 eV or 2.18 * 10^-18 J."
