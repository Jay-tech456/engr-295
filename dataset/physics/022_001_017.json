    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. Several properties of dark matter particles are consistent with observations:\n\n1. Non-luminous: Dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, which is why it cannot be observed directly using conventional telescopes.\n\n2. Cold: Dark matter is believed to be composed of slow-moving particles, referred to as cold dark matter (CDM). These particles move at non-relativistic speeds, which allows them to clump together and form large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n3. Collisionless: Dark matter particles interact very weakly with each other and with ordinary matter, primarily through gravity. This means that they do not collide and scatter like ordinary particles, allowing them to form massive halos around galaxies.\n\n4. Stable: Dark matter particles must be stable or have a very long lifetime to still be present in the universe today.\n\nSeveral types of experiments have been designed to detect and measure the properties of dark matter particles:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles as they pass through Earth and interact with ordinary matter. Examples of such experiments include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the XENON1T experiment, and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS). These experiments use detectors made of materials like liquid xenon or germanium crystals, which produce a signal when a dark matter particle collides with their atoms.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay. For example, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) observe gamma rays from regions like the galactic center, where dark matter particles are expected to be abundant. If an excess of gamma rays is detected, it could be a sign of dark matter annihilation.\n\n3. Collider experiments: Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially create dark matter particles by smashing together ordinary particles at high energies. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC search for signs of dark matter production in the debris of these collisions.\n\n4. Cosmological observations: By studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and the distribution of galaxies in the universe, scientists can infer the properties of dark matter. Experiments like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite have provided valuable information about the density and distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\nThese experiments, along with theoretical research, continue to improve our understanding of dark matter and its properties, bringing us closer to solving one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics."
