    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and the magnification of the image, we can use the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is -30 cm and the object distance (do) is 40 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/-30 = 1/40 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n-40/(-30*40) = (30 + 40*di) / (30*40)\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for di:\n\n-40 = 30 + 40*di\n-70 = 40*di\ndi = -70/40\ndi = -1.75 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is -1.75 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (m) using the magnification equation:\n\nm = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values for di and do:\n\nm = -(-1.75)/40\nm = 1.75/40\nm = 0.04375\n\nThe magnification of the image is 0.04375, or approximately 0.044.\n\nSo, the image distance is -1.75 cm, and the magnification is 0.044."
