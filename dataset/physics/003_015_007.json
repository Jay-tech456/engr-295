    "message_1": "A 10 cm by 10 cm square loop is carrying a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the loop along its axis? (Assume the loop lies in the xy plane with its center at the origin)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the loop along its axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a square loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a²) / (2 * π * (a² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), a is the side length of the square loop (0.1 m or 10 cm), and z is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis (0.05 m or 5 cm).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * π * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / ((0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.61 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing in the xy plane, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane, either in the positive or negative z direction. In this case, the magnetic field will be in the positive z direction.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located 5 cm away from the center of the loop along its axis is approximately 1.61 × 10^(-5) T, and its direction is in the positive z direction."
