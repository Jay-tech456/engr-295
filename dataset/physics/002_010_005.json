    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water at room temperature and standard pressure can be calculated using the given heat of vaporization (40.67 kJ/mol) and the molar mass of water (18.015 g/mol). The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to convert 1 gram of a substance from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase at a constant temperature and pressure.\n\nLatent heat of vaporization (L) = Heat of vaporization / Molar mass of water\n\nL = 40.67 kJ/mol / 18.015 g/mol\n\nTo convert kJ/mol to J/g, we need to multiply by 1000:\n\nL = (40.67 * 1000) J/mol / 18.015 g/mol\n\nL ≈ 2260 J/g\n\nSo, the latent heat of vaporization of water at room temperature and standard pressure is approximately 2260 J/g. Note that this value is an approximation, as the latent heat of vaporization can vary slightly depending on the specific temperature and pressure conditions."
