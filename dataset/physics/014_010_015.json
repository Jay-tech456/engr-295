    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is the radius of the event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses would have a mass of:\n\nM = 1,000,000 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^36 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 x 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 x 1.989 x 10^36 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.954 x 10^9 meters\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of this black hole is approximately 2.954 x 10^9 meters.\n\nTo compare this size to the radius of the Earth, we need to know the Earth's radius. The Earth's radius is approximately 6.371 x 10^6 meters. To find how many times larger the Schwarzschild radius is compared to the Earth's radius, we can divide the Schwarzschild radius by the Earth's radius:\n\n(2.954 x 10^9 m) / (6.371 x 10^6 m) ≈ 463.7\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses is approximately 463.7 times larger than the radius of the Earth."
