    "message_2": "The current understanding of dark matter and dark energy is still limited, but they are believed to play crucial roles in the formation and evolution of cosmological structures like galaxies.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark matter is thought to make up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content. It is believed to be composed of yet-to-be-discovered subatomic particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions.\n\nDark matter plays a significant role in the formation of galaxies and other large-scale structures in the universe. It acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that holds galaxies together and provides the necessary mass for them to form. Without dark matter, the gravitational forces would not be strong enough to hold galaxies together, and they would disperse over time.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that makes up about 68% of the universe's total mass-energy content. It is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but it is often described as a cosmological constant or a form of vacuum energy that permeates all of space.\n\nDark energy influences the growth and evolution of cosmological structures by counteracting the attractive force of gravity. As the universe expands, dark energy causes the expansion to accelerate, which in turn affects the formation of large-scale structures like galaxy clusters. This accelerated expansion can also lead to the eventual \"isolation\" of galaxies as they move farther apart from each other.\n\nIn summary, dark matter and dark energy are essential components of our current understanding of the universe. Dark matter provides the gravitational force necessary for the formation and stability of galaxies, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, influencing the growth and evolution of cosmological structures. However, much is still unknown about their exact nature, and ongoing research aims to uncover more about these mysterious phenomena."
