    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 m from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (10 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T·m) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 20 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 m from the wire is 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
