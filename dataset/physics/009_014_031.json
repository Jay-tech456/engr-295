    "message_1": "A converging lens with a focal length of 10 cm is used to form an image of an object on a screen that is 50 cm away. The object consists of three parallel vertical lines with red, green, and blue filters in front of them. If the separation distance between the red and green filter is 0.1 cm, and the separation distance between the blue and green filter is also 0.1 cm, determine the lateral displacement between the red and blue focal points. What is this phenomenon called?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 10 cm) and the image distance (v = 50 cm). We can solve for the object distance (u):\n\n1/10 = 1/50 - 1/u\n\n1/u = 1/10 - 1/50 = 4/50\n\nu = 50/4 = 12.5 cm\n\nNow we can use the magnification formula to find the lateral magnification (M):\n\nM = v/u = 50/12.5 = 4\n\nSince the magnification is 4, the separation distance between the red and green images will be 4 times the separation distance between the red and green filters, and the same applies to the blue and green images. Therefore, the lateral displacement between the red and green images is:\n\n4 * 0.1 cm = 0.4 cm\n\nSimilarly, the lateral displacement between the blue and green images is:\n\n4 * 0.1 cm = 0.4 cm\n\nSince the red and blue images are on opposite sides of the green image, the total lateral displacement between the red and blue focal points is:\n\n0.4 cm + 0.4 cm = 0.8 cm\n\nThe phenomenon that causes the lateral displacement between the red and blue focal points is called chromatic aberration. This occurs because the lens refracts different wavelengths of light (colors) by different amounts, causing the focal points for each color to be slightly different."
