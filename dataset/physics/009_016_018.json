    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 500 nm passes through a narrow slit that is 0.1 mm wide. What is the angle between the first-order and second-order maximums of the diffraction pattern produced on a screen 2 meters away?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the angular position of the maximums in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = arcsin(m * λ / a)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum (1 for the first-order maximum, 2 for the second-order maximum, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength λ is given in nanometers (nm), so we need to convert it to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\n\nThe width of the slit a is given in millimeters (mm), so we need to convert it to meters:\n\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow we can calculate the angles for the first-order (m = 1) and second-order (m = 2) maximums:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 * (500 * 10^(-9) m) / (0.1 * 10^(-3) m))\nθ2 = arcsin(2 * (500 * 10^(-9) m) / (0.1 * 10^(-3) m))\n\nNext, we find the difference between these angles:\n\nΔθ = θ2 - θ1\n\nFinally, we convert the angle from radians to degrees:\n\nΔθ (degrees) = Δθ (radians) * (180 / π)\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 * (500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))) = arcsin(0.005) ≈ 0.2865 radians\nθ2 = arcsin(2 * (500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))) = arcsin(0.01) ≈ 0.5729 radians\n\nΔθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 0.5729 - 0.2865 ≈ 0.2864 radians\n\nΔθ (degrees) = 0.2864 * (180 / π) ≈ 16.4°\n\nSo, the angle between the first-order and second-order maximums of the diffraction pattern is approximately 16.4 degrees."
