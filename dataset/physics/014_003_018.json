    "message_2": "The temperature of the universe when it was approximately 380,000 years old can be estimated using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the time when the universe was in its early, hot, and dense state. At around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled down enough for the protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process is known as recombination.\n\nAt the time of recombination, the temperature of the universe was around 3000 Kelvin (approximately 2727 degrees Celsius or 4940 degrees Fahrenheit). This temperature is derived from the CMB's current temperature of 2.725 Kelvin and the redshift factor of approximately 1100, which accounts for the expansion of the universe since recombination.\n\nThe implications of this temperature for our understanding of the early universe are significant. The recombination event marked the beginning of the \"Dark Ages\" of the universe, a period when the universe was transparent to radiation and no stars had yet formed. This transparency allowed the CMB radiation to travel freely through space, providing us with a snapshot of the early universe.\n\nThe CMB radiation has been extensively studied, and its properties have provided crucial insights into the early universe's composition, density, and expansion rate. The temperature fluctuations in the CMB also give us information about the initial density fluctuations that eventually led to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years old was around 3000 Kelvin, and this has significant implications for our understanding of the early universe, including its composition, density, and the formation of cosmic structures."
