    "message_2": "Calculating the effective field theory (EFT) for a given quantum field theory (QFT) model involves several steps. The main idea is to integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom, which are not relevant at low energies, and obtain an effective Lagrangian that describes the dynamics of the light degrees of freedom. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant energy scale: Determine the energy scale at which you are interested in studying the system. This will help you identify the heavy and light degrees of freedom.\n\n2. Separate the heavy and light degrees of freedom: Identify the heavy fields (with masses much larger than the energy scale of interest) and the light fields (with masses much smaller than the energy scale of interest).\n\n3. Integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom: Perform a path integral over the heavy fields to obtain an effective action that depends only on the light fields. This step usually involves calculating Feynman diagrams with heavy fields as internal lines and light fields as external lines.\n\n4. Organize the effective action in terms of a derivative expansion: The effective action will typically be a non-local functional of the light fields. To make it more manageable, organize it as a series of local terms, ordered by the number of derivatives acting on the light fields. This is known as the derivative expansion.\n\n5. Identify the relevant operators and their couplings: The terms in the derivative expansion correspond to operators in the effective Lagrangian, with coefficients that can be interpreted as effective couplings. These operators and couplings describe the low-energy interactions of the light degrees of freedom.\n\n6. Match the coefficients: Calculate the coefficients of the effective operators by matching the low-energy scattering amplitudes of the full theory and the effective theory. This step involves comparing the predictions of the two theories at the same energy scale and adjusting the effective couplings to reproduce the full theory results.\n\nExample: Scalar field theory with two fields\n\nConsider a simple QFT model with two scalar fields, φ and χ, with the Lagrangian:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂μφ)² - 1/2 m₁²φ² + 1/2 (∂μχ)² - 1/2 m₂²χ² - gφ²χ\n\nSuppose m₂ >> m₁ and we are interested in the low-energy physics of the φ field. We can follow the steps outlined above:\n\n1. The relevant energy scale is E ~ m₁.\n2. The heavy field is χ, and the light field is φ.\n3. Integrate out the χ field by solving its equations of motion and substituting the solution back into the Lagrangian.\n4. Organize the resulting effective action in terms of a derivative expansion. In this case, the leading term will be a φ⁴ interaction.\n5. The relevant operator is φ⁴, and the associated coupling is an effective coupling λ_eff.\n6. Match the coefficients by calculating the scattering amplitude of φ particles in the full theory and the effective theory and adjusting λ_eff to reproduce the full theory result.\n\nBy following these steps, we obtain an effective field theory for the light field φ, which captures the low-energy physics of the original model."
