    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier, we can use the one-dimensional time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation and the concept of transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient (T) represents the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular potential barrier of height V0 and width L, the transmission coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = (1 + (V0^2 * sinh^2(k2 * L)) / (4 * E * (V0 - E)))^(-1)\n\nwhere:\n- E is the energy of the electron,\n- V0 is the height of the potential barrier,\n- L is the width of the potential barrier,\n- k2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V0 - E) / hbar^2), and\n- sinh is the hyperbolic sine function.\n\nHere, m is the mass of the electron, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / (2 * pi), where h is the Planck constant).\n\nTo find the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier in an atom with a given energy level, you need to know the values of E, V0, and L. Once you have these values, you can plug them into the formula above to calculate the transmission coefficient T, which represents the probability of tunneling."
