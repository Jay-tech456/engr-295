    "message_2": "To find the angle of incidence for unpolarized light reflecting off a glass interface when the reflected light is completely polarized, we can use Brewster's Law. Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence (θi) and the angle of refraction (θr) are related such that:\n\ntan(θi) = n\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the second medium (in this case, glass) with respect to the first medium (air, with a refractive index of 1).\n\nThe problem states that the angle between the reflected beam and the polarized light is 52°. Since the angle between the reflected beam and the surface is the same as the angle of incidence (θi), we can find the angle of refraction (θr) using the following relationship:\n\nθr = 90° - 52° = 38°\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the angle of incidence (θi):\n\nn1 * sin(θi) = n2 * sin(θr)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of air (1) and n2 is the refractive index of glass (1.52).\n\n1 * sin(θi) = 1.52 * sin(38°)\n\nsin(θi) = 1.52 * sin(38°)\n\nθi = arcsin(1.52 * sin(38°))\n\nθi ≈ 58.6°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence for unpolarized light reflecting off a glass interface when the reflected light is completely polarized is approximately 58.6°."
