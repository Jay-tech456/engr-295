    "message_2": "To find the angles of the first three orders of maxima in the diffracted light, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle of the maxima, m is the order of the maxima, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 2400 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 2400 lines/cm = 1 / (2400 * 10^2) m/line = 1 / 240000 m/line = 4.167 * 10^-6 m/line\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the angles for the first three orders of maxima (m = 1, 2, 3):\n\n1) For m = 1:\n4.167 * 10^-6 m * sin(θ1) = 1 * 500 * 10^-9 m\nsin(θ1) = (500 * 10^-9) / (4.167 * 10^-6)\nθ1 = arcsin(sin(θ1)) ≈ 7.2°\n\n2) For m = 2:\n4.167 * 10^-6 m * sin(θ2) = 2 * 500 * 10^-9 m\nsin(θ2) = (1000 * 10^-9) / (4.167 * 10^-6)\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(θ2)) ≈ 14.5°\n\n3) For m = 3:\n4.167 * 10^-6 m * sin(θ3) = 3 * 500 * 10^-9 m\nsin(θ3) = (1500 * 10^-9) / (4.167 * 10^-6)\nθ3 = arcsin(sin(θ3)) ≈ 22.0°\n\nSo, the angles for the first three orders of maxima in the diffracted light are approximately 7.2°, 14.5°, and 22.0°."
