    "message_2": "To find the resistance force acting on the steel ball, we can use the Stokes' Law formula for the drag force on a sphere in a laminar flow regime:\n\nF_d = 6πηrv\n\nwhere:\nF_d is the drag force (resistance force)\nη is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (0.1 Pa.s)\nr is the radius of the sphere (0.02 m)\nv is the velocity of the sphere (5 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nF_d = 6π(0.1)(0.02)(5)\n\nF_d ≈ 0.0377 N\n\nThe resistance force acting on the steel ball is approximately 0.0377 N."
