You want to know what the state is, but you can only perform measurements in the computational basis. Design a procedure to obtain a complete description of the qubit state using quantum state tomography.",
    "message_2": "To perform quantum state tomography on a qubit in an unknown state, we need to reconstruct the density matrix of the qubit. A general qubit state can be represented as:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nwhere α and β are complex numbers, and |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1. The density matrix ρ for this state is given by:\n\nρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| = (|α|^2    αβ*)\n          (βα*    |β|^2)\n\nSince we can only perform measurements in the computational basis, we will need to rotate the qubit state to access the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We can do this using the following procedure:\n\n1. Measure the qubit in the computational basis (|0⟩ and |1⟩) to obtain the probabilities P(0) and P(1). These probabilities correspond to the diagonal elements of the density matrix:\n\n   P(0) = |α|^2\n   P(1) = |β|^2\n\n2. Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the qubit, which rotates the basis states:\n\n   H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2\n   H|1⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2\n\n3. Measure the qubit in the new basis (H|0⟩ and H|1⟩) to obtain the probabilities P(H0) and P(H1):\n\n   P(H0) = |⟨H0|ψ⟩|^2 = |(α + β)/√2|^2\n   P(H1) = |⟨H1|ψ⟩|^2 = |(α - β)/√2|^2\n\n4. Calculate the real part of the off-diagonal element of the density matrix:\n\n   Re(αβ*) = (P(H0) - P(H1))/2\n\n5. Apply a phase gate (S†) to the qubit:\n\n   S†|0⟩ = |0⟩\n   S†|1⟩ = -i|1⟩\n\n6. Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the qubit again and measure the probabilities P(H0') and P(H1'):\n\n   P(H0') = |⟨H0|S†ψ⟩|^2 = |(α - iβ)/√2|^2\n   P(H1') = |⟨H1|S†ψ⟩|^2 = |(α + iβ)/√2|^2\n\n7. Calculate the imaginary part of the off-diagonal element of the density matrix:\n\n   Im(αβ*) = (P(H0') - P(H1'))/2\n\nNow, we have all the elements required to reconstruct the density matrix:\n\nρ = (|α|^2    Re(αβ*) + i*Im(αβ*))\n          (Re(αβ*) - i*Im(αβ*)    |β|^2)\n\nBy following this procedure, we can obtain a complete description of the qubit state using quantum state tomography with measurements in the computational basis."
