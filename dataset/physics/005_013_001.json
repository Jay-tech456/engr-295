    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the particles before and after the collision, we need to calculate the relativistic energy of the moving proton and the rest energy of the stationary proton.\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic energy of the moving proton. The relativistic energy (E) is given by the equation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the proton, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the velocity of the proton.\n\nFor the moving proton, v = 0.9c. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE_moving = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.9)^2)\nE_moving ≈ 2.53 x 10^-10 J\n\nNow let's find the rest energy of the stationary proton. Since it's not moving, its energy is simply its rest mass energy:\n\nE_stationary = mc^2\nE_stationary = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE_stationary ≈ 1.50 x 10^-10 J\n\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the two protons:\n\nE_total_before = E_moving + E_stationary\nE_total_before ≈ 2.53 x 10^-10 J + 1.50 x 10^-10 J\nE_total_before ≈ 4.03 x 10^-10 J\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy after the collision will also be 4.03 x 10^-10 J.\n\nAs for the creation of new particles, it depends on the energy available during the collision. The energy required to create a particle-antiparticle pair is given by:\n\nE_required = 2(mc^2)\n\nFor a proton-antiproton pair, the energy required would be:\n\nE_required = 2(1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE_required ≈ 3.00 x 10^-10 J\n\nThe total energy available in the collision (4.03 x 10^-10 J) is greater than the energy required to create a proton-antiproton pair (3.00 x 10^-10 J). Therefore, it is possible for new particles to be created during the collision, such as a proton-antiproton pair or other lighter particle-antiparticle pairs. However, the exact outcome of the collision would depend on the specific interaction between the protons and the probability of various particle production processes."
