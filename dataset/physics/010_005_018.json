What is the lift force acting on the wings of the plane? Calculate the coefficient of drag if the drag force acting on the plane is equal to 20,000 N.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the lift force acting on the wings of the plane, we can use the lift equation:\n\nLift Force (L) = 0.5 * Air Density (ρ) * Velocity^2 (V^2) * Wing Area (A) * Lift Coefficient (Cl)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s:\n\n200 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 55.56 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the lift equation:\n\nL = 0.5 * 1.23 kg/m³ * (55.56 m/s)^2 * 100 m² * 1.5\nL ≈ 113,097 N\n\nThe lift force acting on the wings of the plane is approximately 113,097 N.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the coefficient of drag (Cd). We can use the drag equation:\n\nDrag Force (D) = 0.5 * Air Density (ρ) * Velocity^2 (V^2) * Wing Area (A) * Drag Coefficient (Cd)\n\nWe are given the drag force (20,000 N), so we can rearrange the equation to solve for the drag coefficient:\n\nCd = Drag Force / (0.5 * Air Density * Velocity^2 * Wing Area)\n\nCd = 20,000 N / (0.5 * 1.23 kg/m³ * (55.56 m/s)^2 * 100 m²)\nCd ≈ 0.051\n\nThe coefficient of drag for the plane is approximately 0.051."
