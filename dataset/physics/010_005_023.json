    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force and lift force experienced by the sphere, we need to determine the Reynolds number and the drag coefficient. \n\nFirst, let's find the Reynolds number (Re), which is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid flow. The formula for the Reynolds number is:\n\nRe = (density of fluid * velocity * characteristic length) / dynamic viscosity\n\nFor a sphere, the characteristic length is the diameter (D). The density of water at 20°C is approximately 1000 kg/m³. Using the given values, we can calculate the Reynolds number:\n\nRe = (1000 kg/m³ * 2 m/s * 0.1 m) / 0.001 Pa·s\nRe = 200,000\n\nNow, we need to find the drag coefficient (Cd). For a sphere, the drag coefficient can be approximated using the following empirical relation for the given range of Reynolds number:\n\nCd ≈ 0.47\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force (Fd) using the following formula:\n\nFd = 0.5 * Cd * density of fluid * velocity² * cross-sectional area\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the sphere (A) is given by:\n\nA = π * (D/2)²\nA = π * (0.1 m / 2)²\nA = 0.00785 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force:\n\nFd = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1000 kg/m³ * (2 m/s)² * 0.00785 m²\nFd = 29.4 N\n\nAs for the lift force, it is generally negligible for a sphere in a uniform flow, as the pressure distribution around the sphere is symmetric. Therefore, the lift force experienced by the sphere is approximately 0 N.\n\nIn summary, the drag force experienced by the sphere is 29.4 N, and the lift force is approximately 0 N."
