    "message_2": "The strong nuclear force between two protons can be described by the Yukawa potential, which is given by:\n\nV(r) = -g * (e^(-mπ * r) / r)\n\nwhere V(r) is the potential energy as a function of the distance r between the protons, g is the coupling constant, mπ is the mass of the pion (which mediates the strong force), and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe force F(r) can be obtained by taking the negative gradient of the potential energy:\n\nF(r) = -dV(r)/dr\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values for g and mπ. The coupling constant g for the strong nuclear force is approximately 14.7, and the mass of the pion (mπ) is approximately 140 MeV/c², where c is the speed of light. To convert the mass of the pion to units of distance, we can use the relation:\n\nmπ = (hbar * c) / λ\n\nwhere hbar is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10^(-16) eV·s), and λ is the Compton wavelength of the pion. Solving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = (hbar * c) / mπ ≈ (6.582 × 10^(-16) eV·s * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / 140 MeV ≈ 1.4 × 10^(-15) m\n\nNow, we can express mπ * r in terms of the dimensionless quantity x = r / λ:\n\nmπ * r = x * (hbar * c) / λ\n\nPlugging this into the Yukawa potential, we get:\n\nV(r) = -g * (e^(-x) / r)\n\nNow, let's find the force F(r) by taking the derivative with respect to r:\n\nF(r) = -dV(r)/dr = -d(-g * (e^(-x) / r))/dr = g * (e^(-x) / r^2) * (1 - x)\n\nSince we are given that the distance between the protons is 1 fermi (10^(-15) m), we can find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx = r / λ = 10^(-15) m / 1.4 × 10^(-15) m ≈ 0.71\n\nNow, we can plug this value of x into the expression for F(r):\n\nF(r) ≈ 14.7 * (e^(-0.71) / (10^(-15) m)^2) * (1 - 0.71)\n\nF(r) ≈ 14.7 * (0.49 / 10^(-30) m^2) * 0.29\n\nF(r) ≈ 2.1 × 10^(-29) N\n\nSo, the attractive nuclear force between the two protons separated by a distance of 1 fermi is approximately 2.1 × 10^(-29) Newtons."
