    "message_1": "A coaxial cable consists of an inner cylindrical conductor with a radius of 1.5 mm and an outer cylindrical conductor with a radius of 3.0 mm. The inner conductor carries a current of 5 amps in the positive z-direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 2.0 mm from the inner conductor?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2.0 mm from the inner conductor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I):\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (θ) and is symmetric about the z-axis. Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop of radius r (2.0 mm) centered on the z-axis. The magnetic field is constant along this loop, so we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nWe are given the current in the inner conductor (I = 5 A) and the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A). We can now solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from the inner conductor (2.0 mm) to meters:\n\nr = 2.0 mm = 0.002 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.002 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.002 m\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 10 μT\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 2.0 mm from the inner conductor has a magnitude of 10 μT. Since the current is in the positive z-direction, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (θ) and follows the right-hand rule. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field is clockwise when viewed from the positive z-direction."
