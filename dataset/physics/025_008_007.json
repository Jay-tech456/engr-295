(Assume the density of muscle fibers to be 1.06 g/cm^3 and the force generation capacity to be 13.5 N/cm^2)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated during muscle contraction, we need to find the volume of the muscle fiber, its mass, and the force generated per unit area.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the muscle fiber:\nVolume = Length × Cross-sectional area\nLength = 1 cm\nCross-sectional area = 0.1 μm² = 0.1 × 10^(-8) cm² (1 μm = 10^(-4) cm)\n\nVolume = 1 cm × 0.1 × 10^(-8) cm² = 10^(-9) cm³\n\n2. Calculate the mass of the muscle fiber:\nMass = Volume × Density\nDensity = 1.06 g/cm³\n\nMass = 10^(-9) cm³ × 1.06 g/cm³ = 1.06 × 10^(-9) g\n\n3. Calculate the force generated per unit area:\nForce generation capacity = 13.5 N/cm²\n\n4. Calculate the force generated during muscle contraction:\nSince the muscle fiber shortens by 10% of its original length, the new length is 0.9 cm. The volume and mass remain the same, but the cross-sectional area changes.\n\nNew cross-sectional area = Volume / New length\nNew cross-sectional area = 10^(-9) cm³ / 0.9 cm = 1.11 × 10^(-9) cm²\n\nNow, we can calculate the force generated during muscle contraction:\n\nForce = Force generation capacity × New cross-sectional area\nForce = 13.5 N/cm² × 1.11 × 10^(-9) cm² = 14.985 × 10^(-9) N\n\nThe force generated during muscle contraction is approximately 14.985 × 10^(-9) N or 14.985 nN."
