    "message_2": "To find the speed of the probe relative to Earth, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is derived from the Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time. The formula is given by:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the probe relative to Earth, v1 is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth (0.80c), v2 is the velocity of the probe relative to the spaceship (0.50c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = (0.80c + 0.50c) / (1 + (0.80c * 0.50c) / c^2)\n\nv = (1.30c) / (1 + 0.40c^2 / c^2)\n\nv = (1.30c) / (1 + 0.40)\n\nv = 1.30c / 1.40\n\nv = 0.9285714285714286c\n\nSo, the speed of the probe relative to Earth is approximately 0.93c."
