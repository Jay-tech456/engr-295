    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field produced by the sphere at a point located 10 cm away from its center, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere, we need to consider the current density (J) instead of the total current.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current density (J) of the sphere:\n\nVolume of the sphere (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3 = (4/3) * π * (0.02 m)^3 ≈ 3.351 × 10^-5 m^3\n\nCurrent density (J) = Total current / Volume = 5 A / 3.351 × 10^-5 m^3 ≈ 1.49 × 10^5 A/m^2\n\nNow, let's consider a small volume element (dV) inside the sphere at a distance r from the center and at a distance R (0.1 m) from the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field. The magnetic field produced by this small volume element (dB) can be determined using the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (J * dV * r * sinθ) / R^3\n\nHere, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), and θ is the angle between the position vector r and the vector R.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at the point 10 cm away from the center, we need to integrate dB over the entire volume of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫∫ dB\n\nSince the problem has spherical symmetry, it's convenient to use spherical coordinates for the integration. The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = r^2 sinθ dr dθ dφ.\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J * r^2 * sinθ * r * sinθ * dr * dθ * dφ) / R^3\n\nThe limits of integration are: r from 0 to 0.02 m, θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.\n\nAfter performing the integration, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * J * R_sphere^3) / (3 * R^3)\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 1.49 × 10^5 A/m^2 * (0.02 m)^3) / (3 * (0.1 m)^3)\n\nB ≈ 1.256 × 10^-7 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced by the sphere at a point located 10 cm away from its center is approximately 1.256 × 10^-7 T."
