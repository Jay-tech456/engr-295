    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of a hydrogen atom in its first excited state (n = 2), we need to find the spontaneous emission rate, which is the rate at which the electron transitions from the excited state (n = 2) to the ground state (n = 1) while emitting a photon.\n\nThe spontaneous emission rate (A) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA = (64π^4 e^2)/(3h n^3 c^3) * |R_nl|^2 * ν^3\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), n is the principal quantum number, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), R_nl is the radial matrix element, and ν is the frequency of the emitted photon.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the frequency (ν) of the emitted photon using the energy difference between the two energy levels (n = 1 and n = 2) and the Planck's constant (h):\n\nΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (-13.6 eV/n^2) * (1 - 1/4) = 10.2 eV\n\nConverting the energy difference to Joules:\n\nΔE = 10.2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.635 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (ν):\n\nν = ΔE/h = (1.635 x 10^-18 J)/(6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 2.468 x 10^15 Hz\n\nNext, we need to find the radial matrix element (|R_nl|^2). For the transition from n = 2 to n = 1 in a hydrogen atom, |R_nl|^2 = 6/81.\n\nNow, we can calculate the spontaneous emission rate (A):\n\nA = (64π^4 (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2)/(3(6.626 x 10^-34 Js) (2^3) (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3) * (6/81) * (2.468 x 10^15 Hz)^3\nA ≈ 6.57 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nFinally, the lifetime (τ) of the hydrogen atom in its first excited state is the inverse of the spontaneous emission rate:\n\nτ = 1/A ≈ 1/(6.57 x 10^6 s^-1) ≈ 1.52 x 10^-7 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of a hydrogen atom in its first excited state with principal quantum number n = 2 is approximately 1.52 x 10^-7 seconds."
