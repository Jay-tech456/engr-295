    "message_2": "To find the position and size of the image formed by the convex lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven the focal length, f = 20 cm, and the object distance, u = -30 cm (negative because the object is on the same side as the incoming light), we can solve for the image distance, v:\n\n1/20 = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nMultiplying through by 60v, we get:\n\n3v = 2v + 60\n\nSolving for v, we find:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nNow, we need to account for the spherical aberration. The given spherical aberration is +2.5 cm, which means the image is formed 2.5 cm farther away from the lens than it would be without the aberration. Therefore, the actual image distance is:\n\nv_actual = v + spherical_aberration\nv_actual = 60 + 2.5\nv_actual = 62.5 cm\n\nNext, we can find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification = image_height / object_height = v / u\n\nLet's assume the object height is h_o. Then, the image height (h_i) can be found as:\n\nh_i = magnification * h_o = (v_actual / u) * h_o\nh_i = (62.5 / (-30)) * h_o\nh_i = -2.083 * h_o\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. The image is formed 62.5 cm away from the lens, and its size is 2.083 times larger than the object size, but inverted."
