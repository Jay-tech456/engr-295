    "message_2": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a space-based gravitational wave observatory that is planned to be launched in the 2030s. It is designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves in the range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz, which are not accessible to ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo. LISA is expected to detect a variety of astrophysical sources, including binary systems of compact objects, massive black hole mergers, and extreme mass ratio inspirals.\n\nThe estimated number of gravitational wave detections per year by LISA depends on the types of sources and their expected event rates. Here, we provide a rough estimate for some of the main sources:\n\n1. Galactic binaries: LISA is expected to detect thousands of close binary systems within our own galaxy, primarily consisting of white dwarfs. The number of detections will be so high that they will form a \"confusion noise\" in the LISA data. The continuous observation of these sources will help improve our understanding of the Milky Way's stellar population.\n\n2. Massive black hole mergers: LISA is expected to detect mergers of massive black holes (with masses in the range of 10^4 to 10^7 solar masses) at a rate of 1 to 100 events per year. The actual detection rate will depend on the underlying astrophysical models and assumptions about the formation and evolution of massive black holes in the universe.\n\n3. Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs): These events involve a compact object (like a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star) inspiraling into a massive black hole. LISA is expected to detect around 10 to 100 EMRIs per year. The detection rate depends on the population of compact objects around massive black holes and their capture rates.\n\n4. Other sources: LISA might also detect gravitational waves from other sources, such as supernovae, cosmic strings, or stochastic backgrounds from the early universe. The detection rates for these sources are more uncertain and depend on the underlying astrophysical and cosmological models.\n\nIn summary, LISA is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources, with the total number of detections per year ranging from tens to thousands, depending on the source type and astrophysical assumptions. The main factors affecting the expected detection rate include the sensitivity of the LISA instrument, the frequency range of the gravitational waves, the distance to the sources, and the underlying astrophysical models for the formation and evolution of the sources."
