    "message_2": "According to the current models of relativistic cosmology, the age of the universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old. This estimation is based on various observations and measurements, including the expansion rate of the universe (given by the Hubble constant), the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), and the distribution of large-scale cosmic structures.\n\nThe Planck satellite mission, which provided high-precision measurements of the CMBR, has played a significant role in refining our understanding of the age of the universe. The CMBR is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its properties allow us to infer the age, composition, and geometry of the universe.\n\nThe Lambda-CDM model, which is the current standard model of cosmology, incorporates dark energy (represented by the cosmological constant, Lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM) to explain the observed expansion history and structure formation in the universe. This model, along with the observational data, leads to the estimation of the universe's age at around 13.8 billion years."
