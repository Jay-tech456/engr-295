    "message_1": "A straight wire carries a current of 3.0 A in the positive z-direction. What is the magnetic field at a distance of 4.0 cm from the wire, along the x-axis? Consider the wire to be infinitely long.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 4.0 cm from the wire along the x-axis, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (3.0 A), and r is the distance from the wire (4.0 cm = 0.04 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3.0 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3.0 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.08 m)\nB = 1.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4.0 cm from the wire along the x-axis is 1.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
