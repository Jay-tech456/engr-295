    "message_2": "To determine the energy output of a black hole with a mass equivalent to that of the Earth through the process of Hawking radiation, we can use the following formula for the power emitted by a black hole:\n\nP = (ħc^6) / (15360πG^2M^2)\n\nwhere P is the power emitted, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nThe mass of the Earth is approximately 5.972 × 10^24 kg. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nP = (1.0545718 × 10^-34 × (2.998 × 10^8)^6) / (15360π × (6.674 × 10^-11)^2 × (5.972 × 10^24)^2)\nP ≈ 9.003 × 10^-29 W\n\nThis is an extremely small amount of power. In comparison, traditional sources of energy output much more power. For example, the total global energy consumption in 2019 was about 1.74 × 10^13 W. The energy output of a black hole with the mass of the Earth through Hawking radiation is negligible compared to traditional energy sources."
