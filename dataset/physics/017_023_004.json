    "message_2": "The creation and propagation of magnetic domain walls and skyrmions in thin ferromagnetic films are governed by a combination of several mechanisms and interactions. These include the exchange interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and the Zeeman interaction with external magnetic fields.\n\n1. Exchange interaction: This is a quantum mechanical effect that arises due to the overlap of electron wave functions in neighboring magnetic atoms. The exchange interaction tends to align the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms parallel to each other, leading to the formation of magnetic domains.\n\n2. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI): This is an antisymmetric exchange interaction that arises due to the spin-orbit coupling and the breaking of inversion symmetry at the interface of thin ferromagnetic films with heavy non-magnetic materials. DMI favors the formation of chiral magnetic structures, such as NÃ©el-type domain walls and skyrmions, with a fixed rotational sense.\n\n3. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy: This is the dependence of the magnetic free energy on the direction of the magnetization with respect to the crystal lattice. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy can stabilize certain magnetic configurations, such as Bloch-type domain walls or skyrmions with specific sizes.\n\n4. Zeeman interaction: This is the interaction of the magnetic moments with external magnetic fields. The Zeeman interaction can be used to manipulate the behavior and stability of domain walls and skyrmions by applying magnetic fields in specific directions and magnitudes.\n\nThe interplay of these mechanisms and interactions determines the formation, propagation, and stability of magnetic domain walls and skyrmions in thin ferromagnetic films. The competition between the exchange interaction and DMI determines the size and chirality of these structures, while the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Zeeman interaction can be used to control their stability and motion.\n\nWhen an external magnetic field is applied, it can affect the behavior and stability of domain walls and skyrmions in several ways:\n\n1. Field-driven motion: The external magnetic field can exert a force on the magnetic moments, causing the domain walls and skyrmions to move in a direction determined by the field and their internal structure.\n\n2. Annihilation and creation: When the external magnetic field is strong enough, it can cause the annihilation of domain walls or skyrmions by aligning the magnetic moments along the field direction. Conversely, when the field is reduced or removed, new domain walls or skyrmions can be created due to the competition between the exchange interaction and DMI.\n\n3. Stability control: The external magnetic field can be used to control the stability of domain walls and skyrmions by affecting the balance between the exchange interaction, DMI, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. For example, a perpendicular magnetic field can stabilize skyrmions by increasing the energy barrier for their collapse into a uniform magnetization state.\n\nIn summary, the creation and propagation of magnetic domain walls and skyrmions in thin ferromagnetic films are governed by the interplay of exchange interaction, DMI, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and Zeeman interaction with external magnetic fields. Understanding and controlling these mechanisms and interactions are essential for the development of novel magnetic devices based on domain walls and skyrmions, such as racetrack memory and skyrmion-based logic devices."
