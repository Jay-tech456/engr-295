Using the Lorentz transformation equations, calculate: \n1. the time elapsed on Earth during the journey\n2. the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lorentz transformation equations for time dilation and length contraction.\n\n1. Time elapsed on Earth during the journey:\n\nThe time dilation equation is given by:\n\nt = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time elapsed on Earth, t0 is the time registered on the spaceship's clock (100 minutes), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nt = 100 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nt = 100 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nt = 100 / sqrt(0.64)\nt = 100 / 0.8\nt = 125 minutes\n\nSo, the time elapsed on Earth during the journey is 125 minutes.\n\n2. Length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth:\n\nThe length contraction equation is given by:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth, L0 is the proper length of the spaceship (the length when it is at rest relative to the observer), and v and c are as defined earlier.\n\nHowever, we don't have the proper length L0 given in the problem. Therefore, we can only express the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth in terms of its proper length:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nL = L0 * sqrt(0.64)\nL = 0.8 * L0\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth is 0.8 times its proper length (L0)."
