    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and heat of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C. We can use the known vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) as a reference point, which is 101.3 kPa.\n\nLet P1 = 101.3 kPa (vapor pressure at 100°C)\nT1 = 373.15 K (temperature at 100°C)\nP2 = ? (vapor pressure at 25°C)\nT2 = 298.15 K (temperature at 25°C)\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40700/8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.3 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3.17 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3.17 kPa.\n\nNow, we need to find the change in vapor pressure as the temperature is increased to 50°C (323.15 K). Let's call the vapor pressure at 50°C P3.\n\nT3 = 323.15 K (temperature at 50°C)\nP3 = ? (vapor pressure at 50°C)\n\nUsing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:\n\nln(P3/P2) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T3 - 1/T2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nln(P3/3.17) = -40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nSolving for P3:\n\nP3 = 3.17 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/298.15))\nP3 ≈ 12.33 kPa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 12.33 kPa.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the change in vapor pressure as the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C:\n\nΔP = P3 - P2\nΔP ≈ 12.33 kPa - 3.17 kPa\nΔP ≈ 9.16 kPa\n\nThe change in vapor pressure as the temperature is increased from 25°C to 50°C is approximately 9.16 kPa."
