    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at 0.6c relative to Earth. Another spaceship travels at 0.8c relative to the same Earth. What is the relative velocity between these two spaceships according to an observer on Earth? Use the relativistic velocity addition formula to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v_rel is the relative velocity between the two spaceships, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (1.4c) / (1 + (0.48c^2) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nv_rel = (1.4c) / 1.48\n\nv_rel â‰ˆ 0.946c\n\nSo, the relative velocity between the two spaceships, according to an observer on Earth, is approximately 0.946 times the speed of light."
