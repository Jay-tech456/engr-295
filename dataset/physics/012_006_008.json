    "message_2": "Resistojets, arcjets, and ion thrusters are all types of electric propulsion systems used for spacecraft. They differ in their working principles, efficiency, and thrust capabilities. Let's discuss each of them in detail:\n\n1. Resistojet Thrusters:\nResistojets work by heating a propellant (usually a gas) using an electrically heated resistor. The heated propellant expands and is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. Resistojets are relatively simple and have low power requirements compared to other electric propulsion systems.\n\nEfficiency: Resistojets have a specific impulse (Isp) in the range of 300-400 seconds, which is higher than chemical propulsion systems but lower than other electric propulsion systems.\n\nThrust Capability: Resistojets have low thrust capabilities, typically in the millinewton to newton range, making them suitable for small satellites and fine attitude control.\n\n2. Arcjet Thrusters:\nArcjets work by creating an electric arc between two electrodes, which heats the propellant (usually a gas) to a high temperature. The heated propellant expands and is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. Arcjets have higher power requirements than resistojets but offer higher efficiency and thrust capabilities.\n\nEfficiency: Arcjets have a specific impulse (Isp) in the range of 500-1000 seconds, which is higher than resistojets and chemical propulsion systems.\n\nThrust Capability: Arcjets have moderate thrust capabilities, typically in the newton range, making them suitable for medium-sized satellites and orbit-raising maneuvers.\n\n3. Ion Thrusters:\nIon thrusters work by ionizing a propellant (usually a gas like xenon) using an electric field, and then accelerating the ions using an electric or magnetic field. The accelerated ions are expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. Ion thrusters have high power requirements but offer the highest efficiency among electric propulsion systems.\n\nEfficiency: Ion thrusters have a specific impulse (Isp) in the range of 2000-4000 seconds, which is significantly higher than resistojets, arcjets, and chemical propulsion systems.\n\nThrust Capability: Ion thrusters have low thrust capabilities, typically in the millinewton to newton range, similar to resistojets. However, their high efficiency allows for significant fuel savings and long mission durations.\n\nIn summary, resistojets are the simplest and have the lowest power requirements but offer lower efficiency and thrust capabilities. Arcjets are more efficient and have higher thrust capabilities but require more power. Ion thrusters have the highest efficiency but also have low thrust capabilities and high power requirements. The choice of propulsion system depends on the specific mission requirements, such as the desired change in velocity (delta-v), mission duration, and available power."
