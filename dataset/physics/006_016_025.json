    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, we need to find the Larmor frequency, which is the frequency at which the hydrogen nucleus precesses around the magnetic field. The Larmor frequency (f) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the hydrogen nucleus, B is the magnetic field strength, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFor a hydrogen nucleus (proton), the gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 42.58 MHz/T (megahertz per tesla).\n\nGiven a magnetic field strength (B) of 1.5 Tesla, we can now calculate the Larmor frequency:\n\nf = (42.58 MHz/T * 1.5 T) / (2 * π)\nf ≈ (63.87 MHz) / (2 * π)\nf ≈ 10.18 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR effect of a hydrogen atom placed in a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla is a precession frequency of approximately 10.18 MHz."
