    "message_2": "To determine the cross-section for the reaction between hydrogen and carbon-12 that produces nitrogen-13 and a gamma ray, we need to consult experimental data or use a nuclear reaction model. The specific reaction we are looking at is:\n\n¹H + ¹²C → ¹³N + γ\n\nUnfortunately, without access to experimental data or a nuclear reaction model, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the cross-section at an incident energy of 2 MeV. However, I can provide some general information on how cross-sections are determined.\n\nCross-sections are typically measured in units of barns (1 barn = 10^-28 m²). They represent the probability of a specific nuclear reaction occurring and depend on factors such as the incident energy, target nucleus, and reaction type. Experimental data for cross-sections can be found in databases like the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) or the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nAlternatively, nuclear reaction models can be used to estimate cross-sections. These models, such as the Hauser-Feshbach model or the Optical Model, take into account various nuclear properties and interactions to calculate cross-sections for specific reactions.\n\nIn summary, to find the cross-section for the given reaction at 2 MeV, one would need to consult experimental data or use a nuclear reaction model."
