    "message_2": "The energy spectrum of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the Milky Way galaxy can be described by a power-law function. The differential energy spectrum, which represents the number of cosmic rays per unit energy interval, is given by:\n\ndN/dE ∝ E^(-γ)\n\nwhere dN is the number of cosmic rays, dE is the energy interval, E is the energy of the cosmic rays, and γ is the spectral index. The spectral index typically has a value of around 2.7 for GCRs in the energy range of 1 GeV to 1000 GeV. At higher energies, the spectrum becomes steeper, with γ increasing to around 3.1.\n\nThe energy spectrum of GCRs is influenced by several factors, including the acceleration mechanism, propagation through the interstellar medium (ISM), and the magnetic field in the ISM. The primary acceleration mechanism for GCRs is believed to be diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants, where particles gain energy by repeatedly crossing the shock front.\n\nThe intensity of the magnetic field in the ISM plays a crucial role in the propagation of GCRs. The magnetic field influences the diffusion coefficient, which determines how efficiently cosmic rays can propagate through the ISM. A stronger magnetic field leads to a lower diffusion coefficient, causing cosmic rays to be more confined to the Galactic plane and have a harder time escaping the Galaxy. This can lead to a higher intensity of cosmic rays at lower energies, as they are more effectively trapped by the magnetic field.\n\nAdditionally, the magnetic field can cause the energy spectrum of GCRs to be modified through processes such as adiabatic energy losses, synchrotron radiation, and inverse Compton scattering. These processes can cause the energy spectrum to become steeper at higher energies, as higher-energy cosmic rays lose energy more efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the expected energy spectrum of Galactic cosmic rays in the Milky Way galaxy follows a power-law function with a spectral index of around 2.7 for energies between 1 GeV and 1000 GeV, steepening to around 3.1 at higher energies. The intensity of the magnetic field in the interstellar medium plays a significant role in shaping the energy spectrum, influencing the propagation of cosmic rays and causing energy-dependent modifications to the spectrum."
