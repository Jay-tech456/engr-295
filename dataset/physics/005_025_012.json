    "message_2": "In relativistic quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle with rest mass m and velocity v can be determined using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. This relation is given by:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the relativistic momentum of the particle. The relativistic momentum is given by:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nSubstituting the expression for p into the energy-momentum relation, we get:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (mvc / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)))²\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nE = mc² / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nThis is the energy of a particle of rest mass m moving with velocity v in relativistic quantum mechanics. Note that when v << c (i.e., the particle is moving much slower than the speed of light), the equation simplifies to the non-relativistic expression for kinetic energy:\n\nE ≈ mc² + (1/2)mv²"
