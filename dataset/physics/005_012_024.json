    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven that the particle's velocity is 0.9c, we can plug this into the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (2.294 - 1)(0.5 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 1.294(0.5 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 5.823 x 10^16 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 5.823 x 10^16 Joules."
