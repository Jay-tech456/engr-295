    "message_2": "To calculate the phonon dispersion relation for a one-dimensional crystal lattice with three atoms in the basis using the nearest-neighbor approximation, we need to consider a few things: the masses of the atoms, the force constants between them, and the lattice constant.\n\nLet's denote the masses of the three atoms as m1, m2, and m3, and the force constants between nearest neighbors as k1 (between m1 and m2), k2 (between m2 and m3), and k3 (between m3 and m1). Let the lattice constant be a.\n\nWe can write the equations of motion for the three atoms in the basis as:\n\nm1 * d²u1/dt² = -k1 * (u1 - u2) + k3 * (u3 - u1)\nm2 * d²u2/dt² = -k1 * (u2 - u1) - k2 * (u2 - u3)\nm3 * d²u3/dt² = k2 * (u2 - u3) - k3 * (u3 - u1)\n\nNow, we can assume a plane wave solution for the displacements:\n\nu1 = U1 * exp(i(kx - ωt))\nu2 = U2 * exp(i(kx - ωt))\nu3 = U3 * exp(i(kx - ωt))\n\nSubstituting these solutions into the equations of motion, we get:\n\nm1 * (-ω²) * U1 = -k1 * (U1 - U2) + k3 * (U3 - U1)\nm2 * (-ω²) * U2 = -k1 * (U2 - U1) - k2 * (U2 - U3)\nm3 * (-ω²) * U3 = k2 * (U2 - U3) - k3 * (U3 - U1)\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n(ω² * m1 + k1 + k3) * U1 - k1 * U2 - k3 * U3 = 0\n-k1 * U1 + (ω² * m2 + k1 + k2) * U2 - k2 * U3 = 0\n-k3 * U1 - k2 * U2 + (ω² * m3 + k2 + k3) * U3 = 0\n\nThis is a system of linear equations that can be written in matrix form:\n\n|ω² * m1 + k1 + k3, -k1, -k3| |U1|   |0|\n|-k1, ω² * m2 + k1 + k2, -k2| |U2| = |0|\n|-k3, -k2, ω² * m3 + k2 + k3| |U3|   |0|\n\nFor non-trivial solutions (U1, U2, U3 ≠ 0), the determinant of the matrix must be zero:\n\n|ω² * m1 + k1 + k3, -k1, -k3|\n|-k1, ω² * m2 + k1 + k2, -k2| = 0\n|-k3, -k2, ω² * m3 + k2 + k3|\n\nSolving this determinant equation will give us the dispersion relation ω²(k) for the one-dimensional crystal lattice with three atoms in the basis using the nearest-neighbor approximation."
