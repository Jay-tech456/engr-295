What is the minimum angle of incidence at the first surface of the prism to ensure total internal reflection at the second surface and what is the minimum distance between the object and the periscope for the object to be visible through the eyepiece?",
    "message_2": "To ensure total internal reflection at the second surface, we need to find the critical angle for the prism. The critical angle (θc) can be calculated using Snell's law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90°, and n1 = 1.5 (refractive index of the prism) and n2 = 1 (refractive index of air).\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°)\nsin(θ1) = 1/1.5\nθ1 = arcsin(1/1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81°\n\nNow, let's find the minimum angle of incidence at the first surface (θi). Since the prism is an isosceles right-angled prism, the angle between the first and second surfaces is 45°. Using the angle of refraction (θ1) we found earlier:\n\nθi + θ1 = 45°\nθi = 45° - 41.81°\nθi ≈ 3.19°\n\nThe minimum angle of incidence at the first surface is approximately 3.19°.\n\nTo find the minimum distance between the object and the periscope for the object to be visible through the eyepiece, we can use the height of the prism (2 cm) and the angle of incidence (θi).\n\ntan(θi) = height / distance\ndistance = height / tan(θi)\ndistance = 2 cm / tan(3.19°)\n\ndistance ≈ 35.87 cm\n\nThe minimum distance between the object and the periscope for the object to be visible through the eyepiece is approximately 35.87 cm."
