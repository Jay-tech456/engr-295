    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at a temperature of 600 K and a cold reservoir at a temperature of 300 K. What is the Carnot efficiency of this heat engine?",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two reservoirs at different temperatures. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 600 K.\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 600 K) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nThe Carnot efficiency of this heat engine is 0.5 or 50%."
