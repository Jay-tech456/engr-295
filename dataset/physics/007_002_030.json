    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has a half-life of 3 days. If the initial activity of the sample was 500 Bq, what will be its activity after 9 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere Activity_final is the activity of the sample after the given time, Activity_initial is the initial activity of the sample, time_elapsed is the time that has passed, and half_life is the half-life of the radioactive material.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nActivity_initial = 500 Bq\nhalf_life = 3 days\ntime_elapsed = 9 days\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nActivity_final = 500 Bq * (1/2)^(9 days / 3 days)\n\nActivity_final = 500 Bq * (1/2)^3\n\nActivity_final = 500 Bq * (1/8)\n\nActivity_final = 62.5 Bq\n\nSo, the activity of the radioactive material after 9 days will be 62.5 Bq."
