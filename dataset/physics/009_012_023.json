    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm\ndo = 15 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/10 = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nTo find di, we can first find the common denominator and then solve for di:\n\n(15 + 10) / (15 * 10) = 1/di\n25 / 150 = 1/di\ndi = 150 / 25\ndi = 6 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is 6 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nM = -6 / 15\nM = -2 / 5\n\nThe magnification is -2/5 or -0.4. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nFinally, we can find the height of the image (hi) using the formula:\n\nhi = M * ho\n\nwhere ho is the object height.\n\nhi = -0.4 * 2\nhi = -0.8 cm\n\nThe height of the image is -0.8 cm, which means it is 0.8 cm tall and inverted.\n\nIn summary:\n- Image distance (di) = 6 cm\n- Magnification (M) = -0.4\n- Height of the image (hi) = -0.8 cm (0.8 cm tall and inverted)"
