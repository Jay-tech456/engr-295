    "message_2": "To determine the change in entropy of the block, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT / T\n\nwhere ΔS is the change in entropy, m is the mass of the block, c is the specific heat of aluminum, ΔT is the change in temperature, and T is the average temperature during the process.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 80°C - 20°C = 60°C\n\nNow, let's find the average temperature (T) during the process:\n\nT = (T_initial + T_final) / 2 = (20°C + 80°C) / 2 = 50°C\n\nWe need to convert the average temperature to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (500 g)(0.215 J/g°C)(60°C) / 323.15 K\n\nΔS = 6457.5 J / 323.15 K\n\nΔS ≈ 19.98 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the block is approximately 19.98 J/K."
