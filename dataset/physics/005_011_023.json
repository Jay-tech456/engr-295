    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven values:\nm_0 = 2.4 × 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v^2/c^2:\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, let's find 1 - v^2/c^2:\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNext, we'll find the square root of (1 - v^2/c^2):\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, let's calculate the relativistic mass:\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2.4 × 10^-27 kg) / 0.6 = 4 × 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the particle at 0.8c is 4 × 10^-27 kg."
