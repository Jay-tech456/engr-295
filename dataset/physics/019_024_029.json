    "message_2": "The calculation of black hole thermodynamics in quantum field theory differs from classical thermodynamics in several key ways. In classical thermodynamics, black holes are treated as simple, non-radiating objects with no temperature. However, in quantum field theory, black holes are treated as quantum objects that have temperature and emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation.\n\nThe main difference between the two approaches lies in the incorporation of quantum mechanics in the quantum field theory description of black holes. In classical thermodynamics, black holes are described by the laws of general relativity, which do not account for the effects of quantum mechanics. In contrast, quantum field theory combines the principles of quantum mechanics with those of general relativity to provide a more complete description of black holes and their behavior.\n\nOne of the most significant insights provided by the quantum field theory approach to black hole thermodynamics is the realization that black holes have a temperature and emit radiation. This was first proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974, who showed that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation, known as Hawking radiation, has a temperature that is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses mass and eventually evaporates.\n\nAnother important insight provided by the quantum field theory approach to black hole thermodynamics is the connection between black hole entropy and the area of the event horizon. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula states that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon, divided by the Planck area. This relationship suggests that the information content of a black hole is related to the geometry of its event horizon, which has profound implications for our understanding of the nature of black holes and the information paradox.\n\nIn summary, the calculation of black hole thermodynamics in quantum field theory differs from classical thermodynamics by incorporating the principles of quantum mechanics, leading to the discovery of Hawking radiation and the relationship between black hole entropy and the area of the event horizon. These insights have deepened our understanding of the nature of black holes and their behavior within the context of quantum mechanics, and continue to inspire ongoing research in the fields of theoretical physics and cosmology."
