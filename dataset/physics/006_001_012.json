    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of the absorbed photon, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number. The ground state corresponds to n=1, and the final state corresponds to n=3.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial and final energy levels:\n\nE_initial = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\nE_final = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 = -1.51 eV\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy levels:\n\nE_photon = E_final - E_initial = -1.51 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 12.09 eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength of the photon using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE_photon = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s), c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E_photon\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nλ = (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s) * (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s) / 12.09 eV\n\nλ ≈ 1.025 × 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the absorbed photon is approximately 1.025 × 10^-7 m or 102.5 nm."
