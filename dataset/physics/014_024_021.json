    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from various astrophysical sources such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts. They interact with the interstellar medium (ISM), which is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. The ISM consists of gas (mainly hydrogen and helium) and dust particles. The effects of cosmic rays on the ISM can have significant implications for the formation and evolution of cosmic structures such as galaxies.\n\n1. Ionization and heating of the ISM: Cosmic rays can ionize the atoms and molecules in the ISM, creating free electrons and ions. This ionization process can increase the degree of ionization in the ISM, which in turn affects the chemistry and cooling processes (Indriolo et al., 2015). The energy deposited by cosmic rays can also heat the ISM, leading to an increase in temperature and pressure. This heating can affect the stability of molecular clouds, which are the birthplaces of stars (Padovani et al., 2018).\n\n2. Magnetic field amplification: Cosmic rays can also contribute to the amplification of magnetic fields in the ISM through a process called the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo (Hanasz et al., 2009). The streaming of cosmic rays along magnetic field lines can generate turbulence and instabilities, which in turn can amplify the magnetic fields. These amplified magnetic fields can affect the dynamics of the ISM, including the formation of molecular clouds and the collapse of these clouds to form stars.\n\n3. Cosmic ray pressure and galactic winds: The pressure exerted by cosmic rays can influence the dynamics of the ISM and the formation of galactic structures. In particular, cosmic ray pressure can drive galactic winds, which are large-scale outflows of gas from galaxies (Salem & Bryan, 2014). These winds can remove gas from the galaxy, suppressing star formation and affecting the overall evolution of the galaxy.\n\n4. Role in star formation: Cosmic rays can also play a role in the process of star formation. The ionization caused by cosmic rays can affect the coupling between the magnetic field and the gas in molecular clouds, which in turn can influence the rate of star formation (Padoan & Nordlund, 2011). Additionally, cosmic rays can affect the fragmentation of molecular clouds, determining the mass distribution of newly formed stars (Stacy & Bromm, 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, cosmic rays can have significant effects on the interstellar medium, influencing the ionization, heating, magnetic field amplification, and dynamics of the gas and dust within galaxies. These effects can, in turn, impact the formation and evolution of cosmic structures such as galaxies, by affecting processes such as star formation and the generation of galactic winds. Understanding the role of cosmic rays in these processes is crucial for developing a comprehensive picture of the formation and evolution of galaxies and other cosmic structures.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Indriolo, N., Neufeld, D.
