    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, 1.4 solar masses would be:\n\nm = 1.4 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (2.7846 x 10^30 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg * 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 2.50614 x 10^47 kg m^2/s^2\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (1.4 solar masses) is converted into energy, is approximately 2.50614 x 10^47 Joules."
