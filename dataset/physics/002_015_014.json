    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between an indoor space at a temperature of 20°C and an outdoor space at a temperature of -5°C. If the heat pump consumes 2 kW of power while providing 8 kW of heating to the indoor space, what is the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the useful heat output (heating) to the input work (power consumed). In this case, the heat pump provides 8 kW of heating to the indoor space while consuming 2 kW of power. Therefore, the COP can be calculated as follows:\n\nCOP = (Useful heat output) / (Input work)\nCOP = (8 kW) / (2 kW)\nCOP = 4\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 4."
