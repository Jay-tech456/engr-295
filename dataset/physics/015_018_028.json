    "message_2": "The amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star is related to the mass of the star, as well as other factors such as the distance to the observer and the nature of the collapse. A simple mathematical model to describe this relationship can be derived from the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission.\n\nThe quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission states that the gravitational wave strain amplitude (h) is given by:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (d^2 I/dt^2) / r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, d^2 I/dt^2 is the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment, and r is the distance to the observer.\n\nFor a collapsing star, the mass quadrupole moment can be approximated as:\n\nI ~ M * R^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the star and R is its radius. The second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment can be estimated as:\n\nd^2 I/dt^2 ~ M * (d^2 R/dt^2)\n\nAssuming a simple free-fall collapse, we have:\n\nd^2 R/dt^2 ~ -G * M / R^2\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the gravitational wave strain amplitude, we get:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (M * (G * M / R^2)) / r\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\nh ~ (G^2 * M^2) / (c^4 * R^2 * r)\n\nThis equation shows that the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star is proportional to the square of the mass of the star (M^2) and inversely proportional to the square of the star's radius (R^2) and the distance to the observer (r). This is a simplified model, and more accurate predictions would require detailed numerical simulations of the specific collapse scenario. However, this model provides a basic understanding of how the amplitude of gravitational waves depends on the mass of the collapsing star."
