    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor is the temperature below which the material exhibits zero electrical resistance and expels magnetic fields (Meissner effect). The value of Tc depends on the specific superconducting material.\n\nFor example, the critical temperature of elemental superconductors like mercury (Hg) is around 4.2 K, while for high-temperature superconductors like yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), it is around 92 K.\n\nThe critical temperature of a superconductor can be affected by external parameters such as pressure and magnetic fields:\n\n1. Pressure: Generally, applying pressure to a superconductor increases its critical temperature. This is because pressure reduces the lattice constant, which in turn enhances the electron-phonon coupling, leading to stronger superconductivity. However, this effect may not be the same for all superconductors, and the relationship between pressure and Tc can be complex.\n\n2. Magnetic fields: The presence of an external magnetic field can suppress superconductivity. When the magnetic field exceeds a certain critical value (Hc), the superconductor transitions to a normal conducting state. This critical magnetic field is also temperature-dependent, and it decreases as the temperature approaches Tc. In type-II superconductors, there are two critical magnetic fields: Hc1 and Hc2. Between these two values, the superconductor allows magnetic flux to penetrate in the form of quantized vortices, creating a mixed state known as the vortex state.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature of a superconductor is a material-dependent property that can be influenced by external parameters such as pressure and magnetic fields. Generally, increasing pressure can increase Tc, while increasing magnetic fields can suppress superconductivity."
