    "message_2": "To calculate the curvature of spacetime for a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses, we will use the Schwarzschild metric. The Schwarzschild metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates.\n\nFirst, we need to find the gravitational radius (also known as the Schwarzschild radius) of the black hole. The gravitational radius is given by:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c²\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 3 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms:\n\nM = 3 * M_sun = 3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the gravitational radius:\n\nR_s = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m³/kg s²) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)²\nR_s ≈ 8.847 x 10^3 m\n\nNow, we can express the Schwarzschild metric in terms of the gravitational radius:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2R_s/r)dt² + (1 - 2R_s/r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nThe curvature of spacetime can be described by the Riemann curvature tensor, which is a complicated mathematical object. However, one way to understand the curvature near the black hole is to look at the Kretschmann scalar, which is a scalar invariant that is derived from the Riemann curvature tensor. The Kretschmann scalar for the Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nK = 12R_s²/r⁶\n\nThis scalar gives us an idea of the strength of the curvature at a given radial distance r from the black hole. As r approaches the gravitational radius R_s, the curvature becomes very strong, and spacetime is highly curved."
