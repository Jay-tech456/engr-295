    "message_2": "Scientists measure the abundance of dark matter in the universe using several indirect methods, as dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter's gravitational influence can bend the path of light from distant galaxies. By observing the distorted shapes of these galaxies, scientists can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation speeds of stars within galaxies can be used to estimate the mass of the galaxy. Observations show that stars farther from the galactic center rotate faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the residual radiation from the Big Bang. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can infer the distribution of dark matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxy clusters and large-scale cosmic structures. By studying the distribution of these structures, scientists can estimate the abundance of dark matter.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that dark matter constitutes approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while regular (baryonic) matter makes up about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy, a mysterious force responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe."
