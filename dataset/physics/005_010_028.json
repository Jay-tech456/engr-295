    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic aberration formula:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) / (cos(θ) + v/c)\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the light beam in the spaceship's frame (30 degrees), θ' is the angle of the light beam in the Earth's frame, v is the speed of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle θ to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(π/6) * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)) / (cos(π/6) + 0.8c/c)\n\ntan(θ') = (0.5 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)) / (0.866 + 0.8)\n\ntan(θ') = (0.5 * sqrt(0.36)) / 1.666\n\ntan(θ') = (0.5 * 0.6) / 1.666\n\ntan(θ') ≈ 0.1799\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ' by taking the arctangent:\n\nθ' = arctan(0.1799)\n\nθ' ≈ 0.1805 radians\n\nFinally, we can convert the angle back to degrees:\n\nθ' ≈ 0.1805 * (180/π)\n\nθ' ≈ 10.34 degrees\n\nSo, the angle at which the light beam will be observed by an observer on Earth due to the relativistic aberration effect is approximately 10.34 degrees."
