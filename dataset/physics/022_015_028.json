    "message_2": "The expected range of axion masses based on current theories and models that hypothesize dark matter as composed of axions is quite broad, spanning over many orders of magnitude. However, the most commonly discussed and well-motivated range is between 10^(-6) eV and 10^(-3) eV (micro-electronvolt to milli-electronvolt). This range is primarily motivated by the so-called \"invisible axion\" models, such as the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, which aim to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and naturally give rise to axions as dark matter candidates.\n\nIt is important to note that the axion mass range is still an open question, and ongoing experimental searches are targeting different mass ranges to either detect or constrain the properties of axions. Some of these experiments include the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX), the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), and the proposed International Axion Observatory (IAXO). These experiments use different techniques to search for axions, such as resonant cavities, helioscopes, and haloscopes, and their sensitivities cover different parts of the axion mass range.\n\nIn summary, the expected range of axion masses for dark matter candidates is typically between 10^(-6) eV and 10^(-3) eV, but the precise value remains uncertain and is the subject of ongoing experimental searches."
