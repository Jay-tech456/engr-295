    "message_2": "To determine the Schwarzschild radius (r_s) and event horizon of a black hole, we can use the Schwarzschild equation, which is derived from the Einstein field equations. The Schwarzschild radius is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, for a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses:\n\nM = 3 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 8.847 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,847 meters.\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, including light. For a non-rotating black hole, the event horizon is located at the Schwarzschild radius. Therefore, the event horizon for this black hole is also 8,847 meters.\n\nNow, let's see how these values are affected if the mass of the black hole is doubled. If the mass is doubled, the new mass is:\n\nM_new = 2 * (5.967 x 10^30 kg) = 11.934 x 10^30 kg\n\nCalculating the new Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s_new = (2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (11.934 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s_new ≈ 1.769 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the new Schwarzschild radius is approximately 17,690 meters, which is double the original Schwarzschild radius. This makes sense, as the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole.\n\nSimilarly, the new event horizon will also be at 17,690 meters, which is double the original event horizon."
