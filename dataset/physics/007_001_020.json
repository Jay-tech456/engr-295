    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during nuclear fission, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is given as 0.1% of the original mass of the uranium-235 nucleus. The mass of a uranium-235 nucleus is approximately 235 atomic mass units (amu). \n\nMass defect = 0.1% * 235 amu = 0.001 * 235 amu = 0.235 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately equal to 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect (in kg) = 0.235 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 3.90227 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow we can use the E=mc^2 equation to find the energy released:\n\nE = (3.90227 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.90227 x 10^-28 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 35.11943 x 10^-12 kg*m^2/s^2\n\nThe energy released is 35.11943 x 10^-12 Joules. To express this in a more common unit for nuclear reactions, we can convert it to MeV (Mega-electron volts). 1 Joule is approximately equal to 6.242 x 10^12 MeV.\n\nEnergy released = 35.11943 x 10^-12 Joules * (6.242 x 10^12 MeV/Joule) â‰ˆ 219 MeV\n\nSo, the energy released when a uranium-235 nucleus undergoes nuclear fission and splits into two equal-sized nuclei is approximately 219 MeV."
