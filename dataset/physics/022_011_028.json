    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the amount of gravitational lensing observed in a galaxy cluster. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as another galaxy or a quasar. This bending of light is due to the gravitational pull exerted by the massive object on the light, causing it to follow a curved path.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, but it does have mass and therefore exerts a gravitational force. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies within a cluster and the distortion of light due to gravitational lensing.\n\nIn a galaxy cluster, both the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) and the dark matter contribute to the overall mass of the cluster. Since dark matter is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe (approximately 85%), its presence in a galaxy cluster greatly enhances the overall gravitational force exerted by the cluster.\n\nThis increased gravitational force due to dark matter leads to a stronger gravitational lensing effect. The light from more distant objects is bent more significantly, resulting in more pronounced lensing phenomena such as multiple images, arcs, and rings around the galaxy cluster. The amount and distribution of dark matter within the cluster can be inferred by studying the patterns and strength of the gravitational lensing observed.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster increases the overall mass and gravitational force of the cluster, leading to a stronger gravitational lensing effect. By studying the gravitational lensing observed in galaxy clusters, astronomers can gain insights into the distribution and properties of dark matter."
