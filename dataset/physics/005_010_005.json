    "message_1": "A spacecraft traveling at 0.6c in a straight line directly towards the Earth observes the position of a star in front of it. The star is known to be 1 light-year away from the Earth. According to the spacecraft, the angle between the direction of the star and the direction of the spacecraft's motion is 45 degrees. What is the apparent angle between the direction of the star and the direction of the Earth as observed by someone on the Earth? (Hint: use Relativistic aberration of light formula)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic aberration of light formula, which is given by:\n\nsin(θ') / sin(θ) = (1 - β) / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the direction of the star and the direction of the spacecraft's motion as observed by the spacecraft (45 degrees), θ' is the apparent angle between the direction of the star and the direction of the Earth as observed by someone on the Earth, and β is the ratio of the spacecraft's speed to the speed of light (0.6).\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle θ from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ') / sin(π / 4) = (1 - 0.6) / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2)\n\nsin(θ') / (1 / sqrt(2)) = 0.4 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\nsin(θ') = (1 / sqrt(2)) * (0.4 / sqrt(0.64))\n\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.4472\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ' by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ' = arcsin(0.4472) ≈ 0.4636 radians\n\nFinally, let's convert the angle θ' from radians to degrees:\n\nθ' ≈ 0.4636 * (180 / π) ≈ 26.57 degrees\n\nSo, the apparent angle between the direction of the star and the direction of the Earth as observed by someone on the Earth is approximately 26.57 degrees."
