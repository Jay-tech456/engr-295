    "message_2": "The Fermi level (E_F) in a material represents the highest energy level that electrons can occupy at absolute zero temperature. In the case of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, the band structure and electrical conductivity are closely related to the Fermi level.\n\nGraphene has a unique electronic band structure, with its conduction and valence bands touching at the so-called Dirac points. At these points, the energy-momentum dispersion relation is linear, and the density of states is zero. This means that, at the Dirac points, graphene behaves as a zero-gap semiconductor or a semi-metal.\n\nThe effect of varying the Fermi level on the electrical conductivity of a graphene sheet can be understood as follows:\n\n1. When the Fermi level is exactly at the Dirac points, graphene is undoped and behaves as a semi-metal. In this case, the electrical conductivity is relatively low because there are very few charge carriers available for conduction.\n\n2. When the Fermi level is shifted away from the Dirac points, either by doping or applying an external electric field, the graphene sheet becomes either n-doped (if the Fermi level is shifted upwards) or p-doped (if the Fermi level is shifted downwards). In both cases, the electrical conductivity increases because there are more charge carriers available for conduction.\n\n3. The further the Fermi level is shifted away from the Dirac points, the higher the electrical conductivity becomes. This is because the density of states increases with increasing energy away from the Dirac points, leading to more available charge carriers for conduction.\n\nIn summary, varying the Fermi level in a graphene sheet directly affects its electrical conductivity by modulating the number of available charge carriers. This is closely related to the unique band structure of graphene, where the conduction and valence bands touch at the Dirac points, and the density of states is zero. By shifting the Fermi level away from the Dirac points, either through doping or applying an external electric field, the electrical conductivity of graphene can be significantly increased."
