    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular current-carrying coil, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current flowing through the coil, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance of the point from the center of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (6.2832 × 10^(-6)) / (2 * 0.0559)\n\nB ≈ 5.64 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point on the axis of the circular current-carrying coil is approximately 5.64 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
