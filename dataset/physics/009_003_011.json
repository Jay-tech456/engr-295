    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection at the boundary between air and diamond, we need to use the concept of critical angle. The critical angle is the angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.\n\nWe can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle. Snell's Law states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and diamond), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor total internal reflection, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees. The refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1, and the refractive index of diamond (n2) is approximately 2.42.\n\nWe can now solve for the critical angle (θ1):\n\n1 * sin(θ1) = 2.42 * sin(90°)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 2.42\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 2.42)\n\nθ1 ≈ 24.4°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for which total internal reflection occurs at the boundary between air and diamond is approximately 24.4 degrees."
