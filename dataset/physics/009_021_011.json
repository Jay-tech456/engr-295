    "message_1": "A beam of unpolarized light is sent through two polarizing filters, one after the other. The angle between the transmission axes of the two filters is 60 degrees. What fraction of the original intensity of the light beam will pass through the two filters?",
    "message_2": "When a beam of unpolarized light passes through a polarizing filter, the intensity of the light is reduced by half. This is because the filter only allows light waves oscillating in one direction to pass through. So after passing through the first filter, the intensity of the light is reduced to 1/2 of its original intensity.\n\nNow, the light that has passed through the first filter is polarized. When this polarized light passes through the second filter, the intensity of the light is further reduced according to Malus' law. Malus' law states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I) is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the transmission axes of the two filters:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I₀ is the intensity of the light after passing through the first filter, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters.\n\nIn this case, I₀ = 1/2 * original intensity, and θ = 60 degrees.\n\nI = (1/2 * original intensity) * cos²(60)\n\nSince cos(60) = 1/2, we have:\n\nI = (1/2 * original intensity) * (1/2)²\n\nI = (1/2 * original intensity) * 1/4\n\nI = 1/8 * original intensity\n\nSo, the fraction of the original intensity of the light beam that will pass through the two filters is 1/8."
