    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change of the system during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = Q/T\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, Q is the heat absorbed by the system, and T is the constant temperature.\n\nGiven:\nQ = 250 J\nT = 298 K\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nΔS = (250 J) / (298 K)\n\nΔS ≈ 0.839 J/K\n\nThe entropy change of the system during the isothermal expansion is approximately 0.839 J/K."
