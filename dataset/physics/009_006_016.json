    "message_2": "To find the object distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven that the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the image distance (di) is twice the focal length, we have:\n\ndi = 2 * f = 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the mirror equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/do + 1/20\n\nTo solve for do, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n2/20 = 1/do + 1/20\n\nNow, subtract 1/20 from both sides:\n\n2/20 - 1/20 = 1/do\n\n1/20 = 1/do\n\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndo = 20 cm\n\nSo, the object distance is 20 cm."
