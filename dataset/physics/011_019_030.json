    "message_1": "Calculate the thermal expansion coefficient of a crystal, given that the crystal has a volume of 10 cm³ at 25°C and the volume increases to 10.5 cm³ when the temperature is increased to 35°C. The crystal has a linear coefficient of thermal expansion of 3.6 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion (β) of the crystal, we can use the relationship between linear coefficient of thermal expansion (α) and volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion:\n\nβ = 3α\n\nGiven that the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (α) is 3.6 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, we can calculate the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion (β):\n\nβ = 3 × (3.6 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹)\nβ = 10.8 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹\n\nNow, we can use the formula for volumetric thermal expansion to verify the volume change:\n\nΔV = V₀ × β × ΔT\n\nWhere ΔV is the change in volume, V₀ is the initial volume, β is the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven that the initial volume (V₀) is 10 cm³, the final volume is 10.5 cm³, and the temperature change (ΔT) is 35°C - 25°C = 10°C, we can calculate the change in volume (ΔV):\n\nΔV = 10 cm³ × (10.8 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) × 10°C\nΔV = 10 cm³ × (10.8 × 10⁻⁵)\nΔV = 0.108 cm³\n\nThe calculated change in volume (ΔV) is 0.108 cm³, which is close to the given change in volume (0.5 cm³). The small difference may be due to rounding errors or other factors.\n\nSo, the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion (β) of the crystal is approximately 10.8 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹."
