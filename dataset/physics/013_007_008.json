    "message_2": "To calculate the average orbital speed (v) of a star around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use the following equation derived from Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal force:\n\nv = √(GM/R)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass contained within the star's distance from the galactic center\n- R is the distance from the star to the galactic center\n\nGiven the distance (R) and the mass (M) contained within that distance, you can plug these values into the equation to find the average orbital speed of the star. Keep in mind that the mass of the Milky Way galaxy is not uniformly distributed, so the mass contained within a specific distance from the galactic center may not be straightforward to determine."
