    "message_2": "Quantum computing with photonic qubits can be used to solve complex mathematical problems that classical computers cannot solve efficiently due to the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. These properties allow quantum computers to perform multiple calculations simultaneously, which can significantly speed up the problem-solving process.\n\nOne example of a complex mathematical problem that quantum computing can solve more efficiently than classical computing is the factorization of large numbers, which is the basis of many cryptographic systems. The most famous algorithm for this task is Shor's algorithm, which runs on a quantum computer.\n\nIn classical computing, the best-known algorithm for factoring large numbers is the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS). The time complexity of GNFS is roughly O(exp((64/9)^(1/3) * (log N)^(1/3) * (log log N)^(2/3))), where N is the number to be factored. For very large numbers, this algorithm becomes extremely slow and impractical.\n\nOn the other hand, Shor's algorithm running on a quantum computer can factor large numbers with a time complexity of O((log N)^3), which is significantly faster than the classical algorithm. This exponential speedup allows quantum computers to solve the factorization problem in a much more efficient manner.\n\nTo illustrate the difference in efficiency, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to factor a 2048-bit number (which is roughly 617 decimal digits long). Using classical computing and the GNFS algorithm, it would take the most powerful supercomputers on the order of 10^9 years to factor such a number. However, with a sufficiently large and error-corrected quantum computer running Shor's algorithm, the same task could be accomplished in just a few hours.\n\nIn conclusion, quantum computing with photonic qubits can be used to solve complex mathematical problems, such as factorization of large numbers, much more efficiently than classical computing. This is due to the unique properties of quantum mechanics that allow quantum computers to perform multiple calculations simultaneously, leading to exponential speedup in certain problem-solving processes."
