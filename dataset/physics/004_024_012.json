    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves produced by the collision of two cosmic strings, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the mass of the system.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the system after the collision. Since there is a 10% energy loss during the collision, the remaining mass of the system is:\n\nM_remaining = 0.9 * (10^20 kg) = 9 x 10^19 kg\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M_remaining)\nf = ((3 x 10^8 m/s)^3) / ((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9 x 10^19 kg))\n\nf â‰ˆ 1.61 x 10^4 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the collision of the two cosmic strings is approximately 1.61 x 10^4 Hz."
