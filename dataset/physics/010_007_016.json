    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the steel cube, we first need to determine the volume of the cube and the mass of the water displaced by the cube.\n\nThe volume of the cube (V) can be calculated using the formula V = a³, where a is the length of one side of the cube. In this case, a = 6 cm = 0.06 m.\n\nV = (0.06 m)³ = 0.000216 m³\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the water displaced by the cube (m_water) using the formula m_water = V * ρ_water, where ρ_water is the density of water.\n\nm_water = 0.000216 m³ * 1,000 kg/m³ = 0.216 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the buoyant force (F_buoyant) using the formula F_buoyant = m_water * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nF_buoyant = 0.216 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 2.11816 N\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of the steel cube (W_cube) to determine the net force acting on the cube. We can calculate the mass of the steel cube (m_steel) using the formula m_steel = V * ρ_steel, where ρ_steel is the density of steel.\n\nm_steel = 0.000216 m³ * 7,800 kg/m³ = 1.6848 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the weight of the steel cube (W_cube) using the formula W_cube = m_steel * g.\n\nW_cube = 1.6848 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 16.523568 N\n\nFinally, we can find the net force acting on the cube (F_net) by subtracting the buoyant force from the weight of the steel cube.\n\nF_net = W_cube - F_buoyant = 16.523568 N - 2.11816 N = 14.405408 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the steel cube is approximately 2.12 N, and the net force acting on the cube is approximately 14.41 N."
