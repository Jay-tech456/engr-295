    "message_2": "The frequency range of gravitational waves emitted from the collision of two neutron stars depends on the masses of the neutron stars, their orbital parameters, and the stage of the inspiral process. However, we can provide a rough estimate of the expected frequency range.\n\nDuring the inspiral phase, when the two neutron stars are spiraling towards each other, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves increases as the stars get closer. The frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system.\n\nThe frequency range of interest for neutron star collisions typically starts at a few Hz and goes up to a few kHz. The lower end of the frequency range is determined by the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, which are sensitive to frequencies above ~10 Hz. The upper end of the frequency range is determined by the point at which the neutron stars merge, which can be around a few kHz.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted from the collision of two neutron stars is roughly from a few Hz to a few kHz. This range is well within the sensitivity of current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, which have already detected gravitational waves from such events."
