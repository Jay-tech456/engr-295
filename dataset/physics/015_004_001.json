    "message_2": "To estimate the energy released by a supernova explosion in gravitational waves, we need to know the amplitude and frequency of the wave signal detected by the observatory. Let's assume the amplitude is A and the frequency is f.\n\nThe strain amplitude of a gravitational wave is given by:\n\nh = A / r\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, A is the amplitude of the wave, and r is the distance from the source to the detector.\n\nThe power emitted by the gravitational waves can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nP = (c^5 / G) * (dE/dt)\n\nwhere P is the power emitted, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and dE/dt is the rate of change of energy with respect to time.\n\nThe rate of change of energy with respect to time can be related to the strain amplitude and frequency of the wave signal:\n\ndE/dt = (32/5) * (G^2 / c^5) * (M1 * M2 * (M1 + M2)) * (pi * f)^2 * h^2\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects involved in the supernova explosion.\n\nTo estimate the total energy released in gravitational waves, we need to integrate the power emitted over the duration of the supernova explosion:\n\nE = âˆ« P dt\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for the amplitude, frequency, and other parameters, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the above equations provide a framework for calculating the energy released in gravitational waves for a given supernova explosion."
