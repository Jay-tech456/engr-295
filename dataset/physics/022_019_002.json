    "message_2": "Gravitinos are hypothetical particles predicted by supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. They are the supersymmetric partners of gravitons, the hypothetical particles that mediate the gravitational force. Gravitinos are considered as a possible candidate for dark matter, the mysterious form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content but does not emit or absorb light.\n\nThe estimated mass range for gravitinos to account for the observed dark matter in the universe is quite broad, spanning from sub-electronvolt (eV) to several TeV (tera-electronvolt) scales. The actual mass of gravitinos depends on the specific supersymmetric model and the parameters involved.\n\nExperimental evidence for or against gravitinos as dark matter is still inconclusive. There are several ongoing and planned experiments that aim to detect dark matter particles directly or indirectly, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. However, none of these experiments have provided definitive evidence for the existence of gravitinos or any other dark matter candidates.\n\nAdditionally, the non-observation of supersymmetric particles at the LHC has put constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric models, making it more challenging to accommodate gravitinos as dark matter candidates. However, it is important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and the search for gravitinos and other dark matter candidates continues.\n\nIn summary, the estimated mass range for gravitinos to account for the observed dark matter in the universe is broad, and experimental evidence supporting or refuting their existence is still inconclusive. Further experimental and theoretical developments are needed to shed light on the nature of dark matter and the possible role of gravitinos."
