    "message_2": "To determine the crystal structure of a material using X-ray diffraction, we need to analyze the diffraction pattern and apply Bragg's Law. Bragg's Law relates the angle of diffraction (θ), the wavelength of the X-rays (λ), and the interplanar spacing (d) in the crystal lattice:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer representing the order of the diffraction.\n\nGiven the parameters:\nλ = 1.54 Å\nθ_max = 30°\nd = 2.5 Å\n\nWe can calculate the possible diffraction angles and their corresponding orders (n) using Bragg's Law:\n\n1.54 Å = 2 * 2.5 Å * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ, we get:\n\nsin(θ) = 1.54 Å / (2 * 2.5 Å) = 0.308\nθ = arcsin(0.308) ≈ 18.1°\n\nSince the maximum angle of diffraction is 30°, we only need to consider the first order (n=1) diffraction. Now, we can use the interplanar spacing (d) to determine the crystal structure.\n\nFor cubic crystal systems, the interplanar spacing (d) is related to the lattice parameter (a) and the Miller indices (h, k, l) as follows:\n\n1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / a^2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the lattice parameter (a):\n\na = sqrt((h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / d^2)\n\nSince we know the interplanar spacing (d = 2.5 Å), we can try different combinations of Miller indices (h, k, l) to find a suitable lattice parameter (a) that corresponds to a cubic crystal system.\n\nFor example, let's try the Miller indices (1, 1, 1):\n\na = sqrt((1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) / (2.5 Å)^2) = sqrt(3 / 6.25) ≈ 0.7746 Å\n\nThis value of the lattice parameter (a) is too small for a cubic crystal system. Therefore, we can conclude that the material does not have a simple cubic structure.\n\nWe can continue testing other Miller indices combinations and analyze the resulting lattice parameters to determine the crystal structure. However, without more information about the diffraction pattern, such as peak intensities and additional diffraction angles, it is challenging to definitively determine the crystal structure of the material."
