    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and water in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence (40 degrees), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nThe refractive index of air is approximately 1.00, and the refractive index of water is given as 1.33. Plugging these values into Snell's Law, we get:\n\n1.00 * sin(40°) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nTo find the angle of refraction θ2, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.00 * sin(40°)) / 1.33\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of sin(θ2):\n\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.6427876097 / 1.33 ≈ 0.4833086968\n\nFinally, we can find the angle of refraction θ2 by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the calculated value:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4833086968) ≈ 29.21°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction for the ray of light in water is approximately 29.21 degrees."
