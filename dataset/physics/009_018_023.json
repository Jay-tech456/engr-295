    "message_1": "A laser with a wavelength of 500 nm is directed at a double slit with a separation of 0.2 mm, and the interference pattern is observed on a screen 2.0 meters away from the slits. If the distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe is 4.0 mm, what is the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen, we can use the double-slit interference formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe, m is the order of the bright fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the double slit and the screen, and d is the separation between the slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- λ = 500 nm = 5 * 10^(-7) m\n- d = 0.2 mm = 2 * 10^(-4) m\n- L = 2.0 m\n- y = 4.0 mm = 4 * 10^(-3) m\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula to find the distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe (m = 1):\n\ny1 = (1 * 5 * 10^(-7) * 2) / (2 * 10^(-4))\ny1 = 4 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the first and second bright fringes (m = 2):\n\ny2 = (2 * 5 * 10^(-7) * 2) / (2 * 10^(-4))\ny2 = 8 * 10^(-3) m\n\nFinally, to find the distance between adjacent bright fringes, we can subtract the distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe (y1) from the distance between the central maximum and the second bright fringe (y2):\n\nDistance between adjacent bright fringes = y2 - y1 = 8 * 10^(-3) - 4 * 10^(-3) = 4 * 10^(-3) m = 4 mm"
