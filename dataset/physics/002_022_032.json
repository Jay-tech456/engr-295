Calculate the activity coefficient of NaCl in the solution at this temperature, given its molar conductivity to be 126.4 ohm^-1 cm^2 mol^-1 and the limiting molar conductivity at infinite dilution to be 126.8 ohm^-1 cm^2 mol^-1.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of NaCl in the solution, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law, which relates the mean ionic activity coefficient (γ±) to the ionic strength (I) of the solution. The Debye-Hückel limiting law is given by:\n\nγ± = exp(-A * √I)\n\nwhere A is a constant that depends on the temperature, dielectric constant, and viscosity of the solvent. For water at 25°C, A is approximately 0.509.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ionic strength (I) of the solution. Ionic strength is given by:\n\nI = 1/2 * Σ(ci * zi^2)\n\nwhere ci is the concentration of ion i and zi is the charge of ion i. For NaCl, we have two ions: Na+ and Cl-. The concentration of NaCl is 2 moles in 1000 mL of water, which is equivalent to 2 M. Therefore, the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- are both 2 M. The charges of Na+ and Cl- are +1 and -1, respectively. So, the ionic strength is:\n\nI = 1/2 * [(2 * (+1)^2) + (2 * (-1)^2)] = 1/2 * (2 + 2) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law to find the mean ionic activity coefficient (γ±):\n\nγ± = exp(-A * √I) = exp(-0.509 * √2) ≈ 0.439\n\nSince NaCl is a 1:1 electrolyte, the activity coefficients of Na+ (γ_Na+) and Cl- (γ_Cl-) are equal to the mean ionic activity coefficient (γ±):\n\nγ_Na+ = γ_Cl- = γ± ≈ 0.439\n\nThus, the activity coefficient of NaCl in the solution at 25°C is approximately 0.439."
