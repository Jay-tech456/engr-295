    "message_2": "The relationship between thermal conductivity (k) and temperature (T) in semiconductors can be described using a combination of two mechanisms: lattice vibrations (phonons) and charge carriers (electrons and holes). The total thermal conductivity (k_total) is the sum of the contributions from these two mechanisms:\n\nk_total(T) = k_phonon(T) + k_carrier(T)\n\n1. Phonon contribution (k_phonon):\n\nThe phonon contribution to thermal conductivity is dominant at low temperatures and can be described using the Debye model. According to the Debye model, the phonon thermal conductivity (k_phonon) is proportional to T^3 at low temperatures and inversely proportional to T at high temperatures:\n\nk_phonon(T) = A * T^3 / (exp(B * T) - 1)\n\nwhere A and B are material-dependent constants.\n\n2. Carrier contribution (k_carrier):\n\nThe carrier contribution to thermal conductivity is dominant at high temperatures and can be described using the Wiedemann-Franz law. According to the Wiedemann-Franz law, the carrier thermal conductivity (k_carrier) is proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity (σ) and the temperature (T):\n\nk_carrier(T) = L * σ(T) * T\n\nwhere L is the Lorenz number, which is approximately constant for most materials.\n\nThe electrical conductivity (σ) can be described using the temperature-dependent carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ):\n\nσ(T) = q * n(T) * μ(T)\n\nwhere q is the elementary charge.\n\nThe carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ) are both temperature-dependent and can be described using empirical models or experimental data.\n\nBy combining the phonon and carrier contributions, we can develop a mathematical model for the thermal conductivity of a semiconductor as a function of temperature:\n\nk_total(T) = A * T^3 / (exp(B * T) - 1) + L * (q * n(T) * μ(T)) * T\n\nThis model can be further refined by incorporating temperature-dependent expressions for carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ) based on the specific semiconductor material."
