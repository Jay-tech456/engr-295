    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton, we need to use the following formula:\n\nKE = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.8c).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the proton (m). The mass of a proton is approximately 1.6726 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the relativistic kinetic energy (KE):\n\nKE = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nKE = (1.6667 - 1) * (1.6726 × 10^-27 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nKE ≈ 0.6667 * (1.6726 × 10^-27 kg) * (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nKE ≈ 1.116 × 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 1.116 × 10^-10 Joules."
