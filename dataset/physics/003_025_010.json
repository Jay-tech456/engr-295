    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a resistor carrying a current of 3 A, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the resistor is a straight wire, we can use the simplified formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium, I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the values:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 Tm/A\nI = 3 A\nr = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^-7 Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12 × 10^-7 T) / 0.1\n\nB = 120 × 10^-7 T\n\nB ≈ 1.2 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the resistor carrying a current of 3 A is approximately 1.2 × 10^-5 T (tesla)."
