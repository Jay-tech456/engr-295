    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of deflection of starlight as observed from a moving spacecraft traveling at 0.9 the speed of light relative to the star, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\ntan(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ * (cos(θ) + β))\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the angle of deflection as observed from the moving spacecraft\nθ is the angle of the starlight relative to the spacecraft's velocity vector in the rest frame\nβ is the ratio of the spacecraft's velocity to the speed of light (0.9 in this case)\nγ is the Lorentz factor, which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nIn this problem, we are not given the value of θ, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the angle of deflection θ'. However, you can use the above formula to calculate the angle of deflection for any given value of θ."
