    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of an external electric field. For the hydrogen atom, the relation between the electric field strength (E) and the separation of the spectral lines can be derived from the perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe energy shift (ΔE) due to the Stark effect for the hydrogen atom can be approximated as:\n\nΔE = -e * E * Δz\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), E is the electric field strength, and Δz is the difference in the z-component of the electron's position expectation value between the unperturbed and perturbed states.\n\nFor the linear Stark effect (when the external electric field is weak), the energy shift is proportional to the electric field strength:\n\nΔE ∝ E\n\nFor the quadratic Stark effect (when the external electric field is strong), the energy shift is proportional to the square of the electric field strength:\n\nΔE ∝ E^2\n\nIn both cases, the separation of the spectral lines is directly related to the energy shift caused by the Stark effect. Therefore, the separation of the spectral lines in the hydrogen atom is proportional to the electric field strength for the linear Stark effect and proportional to the square of the electric field strength for the quadratic Stark effect."
