    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass and size of the event horizon of a black hole can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, and it is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole (M). The formula is given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nDerivation:\n\nThe derivation of the Schwarzschild radius formula comes from the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity. The metric describes the spacetime geometry around a spherically symmetric mass (such as a non-rotating black hole).\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds^2 = -(1 - 2GM/c^2r)dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/c^2r)^(-1)dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2θ dφ^2)\n\nwhere ds^2 is the spacetime interval, t is time, r is the radial coordinate, θ and φ are the angular coordinates, and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nThe event horizon occurs at the radius where the spacetime interval ds^2 becomes singular (i.e., infinite). This happens when the coefficient of the dt^2 term becomes zero:\n\n1 - 2GM/c^2r = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr = Rs = 2GM/c^2\n\nThis equation shows that the size of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius) is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. As the mass of the black hole increases, so does the size of its event horizon."
