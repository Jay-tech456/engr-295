    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p) formula: p = m * v * γ, where m is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n2. Lorentz factor (γ) formula: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light.\n3. Relativistic kinetic energy (K) formula: K = (γ - 1) * m * c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can find the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = m * v * γ\np = (2.5 GeV/c²) * (0.8c) * (1.6667)\np = 2.5 * 0.8 * 1.6667 GeV/c\np ≈ 3.3333 GeV/c\n\nFinally, let's find the relativistic kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c²\nK = (1.6667 - 1) * (2.5 GeV/c²) * c²\nK = 0.6667 * 2.5 GeV\nK ≈ 1.6667 GeV\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the particle is approximately 3.3333 GeV/c, and the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 1.6667 GeV."
