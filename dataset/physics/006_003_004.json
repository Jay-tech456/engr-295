    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field required to split the spectral line of hydrogen Balmer alpha line (656.28 nm) by 1 nm due to the Zeeman effect, we can use the formula for the Zeeman effect:\n\nΔλ = (e * B * λ^2) / (4 * π * m_e * c)\n\nwhere:\nΔλ = change in wavelength (1 nm)\ne = elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nB = magnetic field strength (unknown)\nλ = wavelength of the spectral line (656.28 nm)\nm_e = mass of an electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nc = speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nWe want to find B, so we can rearrange the formula:\n\nB = (4 * π * m_e * c * Δλ) / (e * λ^2)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelengths from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 656.28 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.5628 x 10^-7 m\nΔλ = 1 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 1 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for B:\n\nB = (4 * π * (9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 x 10^-9 m)) / ((1.602 x 10^-19 C) * (6.5628 x 10^-7 m)^2)\n\nB ≈ 1.18 T (Tesla)\n\nTherefore, a magnetic field of approximately 1.18 Tesla is required to split the hydrogen Balmer alpha line by 1 nm due to the Zeeman effect."
