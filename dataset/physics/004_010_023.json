    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 1,000,000 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^36 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = 2 x (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) x (1.989 x 10^36 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ 2 x (6.674 x 10^-11) x (1.989 x 10^36) / (9 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.954 x 10^12 meters\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses is approximately 2.954 x 10^12 meters or about 2.954 million kilometers."
