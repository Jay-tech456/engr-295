    "message_2": "Calculating quantum gravity effects in a quantum field theory (QFT) model that includes gravity as a fundamental force is a challenging task. The main difficulty arises from the fact that gravity, as described by General Relativity, is a geometric theory, while QFT is a framework based on flat spacetime. However, there have been several approaches to tackle this problem, such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, and asymptotic safety.\n\nIn order to calculate quantum gravity effects in a QFT model, one can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Choose an approach: Select a theoretical framework to study quantum gravity, such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, or asymptotic safety. Each approach has its own set of tools and techniques to handle the problem.\n\n2. Formulate the action: Write down the action for the combined system of gravity and other fields (such as the electromagnetic field, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force). The action should include both the gravitational part (usually the Einstein-Hilbert action) and the matter part (for example, the Standard Model Lagrangian).\n\n3. Quantize the theory: Apply the standard quantization procedures of QFT to the combined action. This may involve canonical quantization or path integral quantization. In some approaches, like string theory, the quantization process is more intricate and requires additional steps.\n\n4. Renormalize the theory: One of the main challenges in quantum gravity is that the naive quantization of gravity leads to a non-renormalizable theory, meaning that it contains an infinite number of divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Some approaches, like string theory and asymptotic safety, provide a way to overcome this issue and obtain a finite and well-defined theory.\n\n5. Calculate observables: Once the theory is quantized and renormalized, one can compute various observables, such as scattering amplitudes, correlation functions, or particle spectra. These observables can be used to make specific predictions about the effects of gravity on the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\nIt is important to note that the problem of quantum gravity is still an open question in theoretical physics, and there is no universally accepted approach to solve it. Different approaches have their own successes and challenges, and more research is needed to determine which, if any, of these approaches provides the correct description of quantum gravity."
