    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere:\n- r_s is the Schwarzschild radius\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole (in this case, the mass of the Sun, which is 1.989 × 10^30 kg)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a non-rotating black hole with a mass equivalent to the Sun is approximately 2.95 kilometers."
