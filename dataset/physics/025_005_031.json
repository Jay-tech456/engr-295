    "message_2": "The relationship between the applied force and the extension of DNA when subjected to mechanical stress can be described using the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) model. The WLC model is a widely used model in biophysics to describe the elasticity of polymers, such as DNA, under mechanical stress.\n\nIn the WLC model, the DNA molecule is considered as a semi-flexible polymer chain with a persistence length (Lp), which is a measure of the chain's stiffness. For DNA, the persistence length is approximately 50 nm (150 base pairs). The contour length (Lc) represents the total length of the DNA molecule when fully stretched.\n\nThe WLC model describes the relationship between the applied force (F) and the extension (x) of the DNA molecule as follows:\n\nF = (k_B * T) / Lp * (1 / (4 * (1 - x / Lc)^2) - 1 / 4 + x / Lc)\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, Lp is the persistence length, Lc is the contour length, and x is the extension of the DNA molecule.\n\nThis equation shows that the force required to extend the DNA molecule increases as the extension approaches the contour length. The elasticity of the DNA molecule changes under constant force, as the molecule transitions from a coiled state to a more extended state.\n\nTo model the change in elasticity mathematically, one can use the WLC model equation to calculate the force-extension curve for a given DNA molecule. This curve can be used to study the mechanical properties of DNA and understand how the elasticity changes under different applied forces. Additionally, the WLC model can be extended to include other factors, such as the presence of bound proteins or the effect of supercoiling, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of DNA mechanics under various conditions."
