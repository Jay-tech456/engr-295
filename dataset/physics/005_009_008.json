What is the frequency of the spacecraft's transmission as measured by an astronaut on board the spacecraft? (Assume the speed of light, c = 3 × 10^8 m/s)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which relates the observed frequency (f_obs) to the source frequency (f_src) in the presence of relative motion between the observer and the source. The formula is:\n\nf_obs = f_src * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the observer and the source, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the observer on Earth measures the frequency of the spacecraft's radio transmission to be 15 MHz (f_obs), and the spacecraft is traveling towards the Earth with a velocity of 0.8c (v = 0.8c). We want to find the frequency of the spacecraft's transmission as measured by an astronaut on board the spacecraft (f_src).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the formula to solve for f_src:\n\nf_src = f_obs / sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nf_src = (15 × 10^6 Hz) / sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_src = (15 × 10^6 Hz) / sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_src = (15 × 10^6 Hz) / sqrt(9)\n\nf_src = (15 × 10^6 Hz) / 3\n\nf_src = 5 × 10^6 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the spacecraft's transmission as measured by an astronaut on board the spacecraft is 5 MHz."
