    "message_2": "The Higgs boson plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is associated with the Higgs field, an energy field that permeates all of space. The primary function of the Higgs boson is to explain the origin of masses of fundamental particles, particularly the masses of W and Z bosons, and the masses of quarks and leptons.\n\nIn the Standard Model, particles acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field. When particles pass through the Higgs field, they interact with it, and this interaction gives them mass. The strength of the interaction determines the mass of the particle - the stronger the interaction, the more massive the particle. The Higgs boson is a manifestation of the Higgs field, and its discovery confirms the existence of this field.\n\nExperimental evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson was first obtained in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Two separate experiments, ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), independently observed a new particle consistent with the properties of the Higgs boson. The discovery was announced on July 4, 2012, and the particle was confirmed to be the Higgs boson in March 2013.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson was a significant milestone in the field of particle physics, as it confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and validated the Standard Model's explanation for the origin of mass in fundamental particles. Moreover, the discovery of the Higgs boson earned the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical physicists Peter Higgs and Fran√ßois Englert, who had proposed the Higgs mechanism in the 1960s."
