    "message_2": "The weak mixing angle, also known as the Weinberg angle (θ_W), is a parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics that describes the mixing between the electromagnetic and weak interactions. The value of the weak mixing angle is determined experimentally through precision measurements of the weak interaction in high-energy experiments.\n\nAs of the latest measurements, the weak mixing angle is determined to be:\n\nsin²θ_W ≈ 0.23122\n\nIt is important to note that this value is subject to change as more precise measurements are made in future experiments."
