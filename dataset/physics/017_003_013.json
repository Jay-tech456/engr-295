    "message_2": "To find the refractive index of the material, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and the material), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction (transmitted angle).\n\nIn this case, we are given the transmitted angle (θ2) as 30 degrees. We need to find the angle of incidence (θ1) to use Snell's Law. However, we don't have enough information to determine the angle of incidence. \n\nIf you can provide the angle of incidence or any other relevant information, I can help you find the refractive index of the material."
