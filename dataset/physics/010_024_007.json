    "message_2": "To determine the critical mass of a protostar that will decide its fate as either a main sequence star or a black hole, we need to consider several factors, including the protostar's initial temperature, radius, and composition of fluids (mainly hydrogen and helium). We will use the concept of the Jeans mass, which is the critical mass above which a gas cloud will collapse under its own gravity to form a star.\n\nThe Jeans mass (M_J) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nM_J = (5 * k * T * R) / (G * μ * m_H)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K)\n- T is the initial temperature of the protostar (in Kelvin)\n- R is the initial radius of the protostar (in meters)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2)\n- μ is the mean molecular weight of the gas (for a mixture of hydrogen and helium, μ ≈ 1.3)\n- m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 × 10^(-27) kg)\n\nOnce we have the Jeans mass, we can compare it to the mass of the protostar to determine its fate. If the protostar's mass is less than the Jeans mass, it will likely become a main sequence star. If the protostar's mass is greater than the Jeans mass, it may continue to collapse and potentially evolve into a black hole.\n\nPlease provide the initial temperature, radius, and composition of fluids for the protostar in question, and we can calculate the critical mass for you."
