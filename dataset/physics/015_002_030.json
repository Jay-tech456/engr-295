    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two neutron stars, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase of a binary system:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/96 * π^(8/3) * (G * M_chirp / c^3)^(5/3) * (1 / r)))^(3/8)\n\nwhere:\nf is the frequency of the gravitational waves\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system\nr is the distance between the two neutron stars\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the chirp mass of the binary system. The chirp mass is given by:\n\nM_chirp = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. We are given that the masses of the neutron stars are 1.4 solar masses each. We need to convert these masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nm1 = m2 = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (2.7846 x 10^30 kg * 2.7846 x 10^30 kg)^(3/5) / (2.7846 x 10^30 kg + 2.7846 x 10^30 kg)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 2.435 x 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the neutron stars from light-years to meters:\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n\nr = 200 million light-years = 200 x 10^6 * 9.461 x 10^15 m = 1.8922 x 10^24 m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (5/96 * π^(8/3) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 2.435 x 10^30 kg / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3)^(5/3) * (1 / 1.8922 x 10^24 m)))^(3/8)\nf ≈ 70.9 Hz\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two neutron stars with masses of 1.4 solar masses and a distance of 200 million light-years from Earth is approximately 70.9 Hz."
