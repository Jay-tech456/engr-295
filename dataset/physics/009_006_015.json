    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -20 cm (concave mirror has a negative focal length)\nu = -30 cm (object distance is negative as it is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-60 = -40 + 2v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n2v = -20\nv = -10 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is -10 cm, which means the image is formed 10 cm in front of the mirror (virtual image).\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -(-10)/(-30)\nM = 10/30\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object.\n\nSince the magnification is positive, the image is upright (same orientation as the object).\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is a virtual, upright image located 10 cm in front of the mirror, and it is 1/3 the size of the object."
