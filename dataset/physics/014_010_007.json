    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass, radius, and event horizon of a black hole is described by the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole and is given by:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere:\n- Rs is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius)\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nThe gravitational pull of a black hole is determined by its mass and the distance from its center. The gravitational force (F) between two objects is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nwhere:\n- F is the gravitational force\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects\n- r is the distance between the centers of the two objects\n\nAs the mass of a black hole increases, its Schwarzschild radius (event horizon) also increases. This means that the event horizon becomes larger, and objects need to be closer to the black hole to be affected by its gravitational pull. However, the gravitational force experienced by an object at a fixed distance from the black hole will also increase as the mass of the black hole increases.\n\nIt is important to note that the gravitational pull of a black hole is not different from any other object with the same mass. The key difference is that the black hole is extremely dense, which allows its event horizon to be much closer to its center than other celestial objects. Once an object crosses the event horizon, it cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull, even if it were to travel at the speed of light."
