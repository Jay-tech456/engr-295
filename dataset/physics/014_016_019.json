    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 10^18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the flux of cosmic rays and the cross-sectional area of a human body.\n\n1. Cosmic ray flux: The flux of cosmic rays with energy greater than 10^18 eV is approximately 1 particle per square kilometer per year (1 km^-2 yr^-1).\n\n2. Cross-sectional area of a human body: A typical human body has a cross-sectional area of about 0.1 square meters (0.1 m^2).\n\nNow, we need to convert the units to be consistent:\n\n1 km^2 = 1,000,000 m^2\n\nSo, the cosmic ray flux in terms of m^2 is:\n\n1 km^-2 yr^-1 * (1,000,000 m^2 / 1 km^2) = 1,000,000 m^-2 yr^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of a cosmic ray passing through a human body:\n\nProbability = (Cosmic ray flux) * (Cross-sectional area of a human body)\n\nProbability = (1,000,000 m^-2 yr^-1) * (0.1 m^2) = 100,000 yr^-1\n\nHowever, this is the probability per year. To find the probability per second, we need to divide by the number of seconds in a year:\n\nProbability per second = 100,000 yr^-1 / (365 days/yr * 24 hr/day * 60 min/hr * 60 s/min) ≈ 3.17 x 10^-3 s^-1\n\nNow, let's estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray. Cosmic rays with energy of 10^18 eV are mostly protons. The energy deposition of a proton in human tissue is about 2 MeV per centimeter (2 x 10^6 eV/cm).\n\nAssuming the cosmic ray passes through the body with a path length of about 20 cm, the total energy deposited in the body would be:\n\nEnergy deposition = (2 x 10^6 eV/cm) * (20 cm) = 4 x 10^7 eV\n\nTo convert this energy to the unit of absorbed dose, gray (Gy), we need to divide by the mass of the tissue through which the cosmic ray passes and the elementary charge:\n\n1 Gy = 1 J/kg\n\nElementary charge = 1.6 x 10^-19 C\n\nAssuming the mass of the tissue is about 20 kg:\n\nAbsorbed dose = (4 x 10^7 eV) * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) / (20 kg) ≈ 3.2 x 10^-12 Gy\n\nSo, the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to a single 10^18 eV cosmic ray is approximately 3.2 x 10^-12 Gy."
