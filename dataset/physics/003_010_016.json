    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a long hollow cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long hollow cylinder with a uniform current density, the magnetic field is symmetrical and parallel to the circumference of the cylinder. Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius r (r < 5 cm) centered at the axis of the cylinder. The magnetic field is constant along the loop, so we can write:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nTo find the enclosed current (I_enclosed), we need to find the current density (J) first. The current density is the current per unit area:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. Since the cylinder is hollow, the cross-sectional area is:\n\nA = π(R² - r²) = π(0.05² - 0²) = π(0.0025) m²\n\nwhere R is the outer radius of the cylinder (5 cm = 0.05 m) and r is the inner radius (0 m since it's hollow). Now, we can find the current density:\n\nJ = 2 A / (π(0.0025) m²) = 800 A/m²\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the Amperian loop with radius r:\n\nA_loop = πr²\n\nThe enclosed current is the product of the current density and the area of the Amperian loop:\n\nI_enclosed = J * A_loop = 800 A/m² * πr²\n\nNow, we can plug this into Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀(800 A/m² * πr²)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. We can rearrange the equation to solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 800 A/m² * πr²) / (2πr)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 800 A/m² * πr²) / (2πr)\n\nSince we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the cylinder, we set r = 0:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 800 A/m² * π(0)²) / (2π(0))\n\nB = 0 T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of a long hollow cylinder with a radius of 5 cm carrying a current of 2 A is 0 T (tesla)."
