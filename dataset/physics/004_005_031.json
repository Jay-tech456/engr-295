    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the curvature of space-time caused by a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass, such as a black hole or a non-rotating star. The metric is given by:\n\nds^2 = -(1 - 2GM/c^2r)dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/c^2r)^(-1)dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2θ dφ^2)\n\nwhere ds^2 is the spacetime interval, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light, r is the radial coordinate, and (θ, φ) are the angular coordinates.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is a characteristic radius associated with the mass of the object, defined as:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nFor a black hole, the event horizon is the boundary within which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The radius of the event horizon (Re) is equal to the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRe = Rs\n\nNow, let's calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses. The mass of the sun (Ms) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (Mb) is:\n\nMb = 5Ms = 5 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nUsing the formula for the Schwarzschild radius, we get:\n\nRs = 2G * Mb / c^2 = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs ≈ 1.474 x 10^4 m\n\nSince the radius of the event horizon is equal to the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole, the ratio of the radius of the event horizon to the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRe/Rs = 1\n\nSo, the ratio of the radius of the event horizon to the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is 1."
