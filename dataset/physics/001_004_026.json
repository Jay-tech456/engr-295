    "message_2": "The first excited state of the hydrogen atom is the state in which the electron is in the second energy level (n=2), also known as the 2s or 2p state. The energy levels of the hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the ground state (n=1), the energy is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the first excited state (n=2), the energy is:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nTo calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from the ground state to the first excited state, we need to find the difference in energy between these two states:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, 10.2 electron volts (eV) of energy is required to excite a hydrogen atom from the ground state to the first excited state."
