    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection at the glass-to-air boundary, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (glass), n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium (air), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. For total internal reflection, the angle of refraction (θ2) should be 90 degrees.\n\nn1 = 1.5 (glass)\nn2 = 1 (air, approximately)\nθ2 = 90 degrees\n\nNow, we can rearrange Snell's Law to find the critical angle (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90) / 1.5\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection at the glass-to-air boundary is approximately 41.81 degrees."
