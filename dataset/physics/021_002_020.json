    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe mass of the Sun (M) is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.954 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass equivalent to that of the Sun is approximately 2,954 meters, or about 2.954 kilometers.\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, including light. The size of the event horizon is directly related to the Schwarzschild radius. In this case, the event horizon would be a sphere with a radius of 2.954 kilometers."
