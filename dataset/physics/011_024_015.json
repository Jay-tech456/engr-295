    "message_2": "The primary difference between a topological insulator (TI) and a normal insulator lies in their electronic structures and the behavior of electrons at the surface of the material.\n\nIn a normal insulator, the electronic structure consists of a filled valence band and an empty conduction band, separated by a bandgap. Electrons in the valence band are localized, and there is no conducting state at the surface or the bulk of the material.\n\nOn the other hand, a topological insulator has a similar bulk electronic structure with a filled valence band and an empty conduction band separated by a bandgap. However, the key difference is that TIs possess conducting surface states that are topologically protected. These surface states form a Dirac cone, where the valence and conduction bands touch at a single point called the Dirac point.\n\nThe topological protection of the surface states arises due to the non-trivial topology of the bulk electronic wavefunctions, which can be characterized by a topological invariant called the Z2 index. The Z2 index can take values of 0 or 1, where 0 corresponds to a trivial insulator and 1 corresponds to a topological insulator.\n\nMathematically, the Z2 index can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nZ2 = (1/2π) ∮ dk . A(k)\n\nwhere A(k) is the Berry connection, and the integral is taken over the Brillouin zone. The Berry connection is given by:\n\nA(k) = -i <u(k)|∇_k|u(k)>\n\nwhere |u(k)> is the periodic part of the Bloch wavefunction.\n\nThe behavior of electrons at the surface of a topological insulator is significantly different from that of a normal insulator. In a TI, the surface states are characterized by spin-momentum locking, where the electron's spin is locked perpendicular to its momentum. This leads to unique properties such as the suppression of backscattering and robustness against non-magnetic impurities.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a topological insulator and a normal insulator lies in their electronic structures, specifically the presence of topologically protected surface states in TIs. This difference results in unique electronic behavior at the surface of topological insulators, such as spin-momentum locking and robustness against non-magnetic impurities."
