    "message_2": "According to Raoult's law, the vapor pressure of a component in a mixture is equal to the product of the mole fraction of that component and its vapor pressure in the pure state. In this case, we are given the mole fraction of water (0.75) and the total pressure (80 kPa). We need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C.\n\nFirst, let's find the vapor pressure of pure water at 25 °C. We can use the Antoine equation to estimate this value:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere P is the vapor pressure, T is the temperature in Celsius, and A, B, and C are Antoine constants for water. For water, the constants are:\n\nA = 8.07131\nB = 1730.63\nC = 233.426\n\nNow, let's plug in the temperature (T = 25 °C) and solve for the vapor pressure of pure water:\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / (25 + 233.426))\nlog10(P) ≈ 2.47712\n\nTo find the vapor pressure, we take the antilog:\n\nP = 10^2.47712 ≈ 29.87 kPa\n\nNow, we can use Raoult's law to find the vapor pressure of water in the mixture:\n\nP_water = mole_fraction_water * P_pure_water\nP_water = 0.75 * 29.87 kPa\nP_water ≈ 22.40 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C in the mixture is approximately 22.40 kPa."
