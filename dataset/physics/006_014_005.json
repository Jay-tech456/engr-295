    "message_1": "Calculate the lifetime of an excited state in a hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n=3 that decays through spontaneous emission to the ground state. The energy difference between the excited and ground state is 1.89 eV. Given that the transition probability between the excited and ground state is 7.2 x 10^-7 s^-1, determine the lifetime of the excited state in seconds.",
    "message_2": "The lifetime of an excited state is the inverse of the transition probability between the excited and ground state. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nLifetime (τ) = 1 / Transition probability (A)\n\nGiven the transition probability (A) between the excited and ground state is 7.2 x 10^-7 s^-1, we can calculate the lifetime (τ) as follows:\n\nτ = 1 / (7.2 x 10^-7 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 1.39 x 10^6 s\n\nTherefore, the lifetime of the excited state in a hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n=3 that decays through spontaneous emission to the ground state is approximately 1.39 x 10^6 seconds."
