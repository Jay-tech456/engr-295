    "message_2": "Astronomers detect the presence of black holes through several indirect methods, as black holes themselves do not emit light or any electromagnetic radiation. The most common methods are:\n\n1. Gravitational effects on nearby objects: Astronomers observe the motion of nearby stars or gas clouds that are orbiting an invisible object. By analyzing their orbits, they can infer the mass and location of the unseen object. If the mass is concentrated in a small enough region, it is likely to be a black hole.\n\n2. Accretion disk and X-ray emissions: When a black hole is part of a binary system with a companion star, it can draw matter from the star, forming an accretion disk around the black hole. The matter in the accretion disk is heated to very high temperatures due to friction and gravitational forces, causing it to emit X-rays. Astronomers can detect these X-rays and infer the presence of a black hole.\n\n3. Gravitational waves: When two black holes or other massive objects merge, they create ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These waves can be detected by observatories like LIGO and VIRGO, which can provide information about the masses and properties of the merging objects, confirming the presence of black holes.\n\nRegarding gamma-ray bursts, they are not directly caused by black holes but are associated with extremely energetic events in the universe. There are two main types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs):\n\n1. Short-duration GRBs: These last for less than 2 seconds and are believed to be caused by the merger of two compact objects, such as neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. The merger creates a highly energetic environment, resulting in the emission of gamma rays.\n\n2. Long-duration GRBs: These last for more than 2 seconds and are associated with the collapse of massive stars (supernovae or hypernovae). When the core of a massive star collapses, it can form a black hole. The surrounding material falls into the black hole, creating an accretion disk. During this process, powerful jets of matter and energy are launched from the vicinity of the black hole at nearly the speed of light. These jets interact with the surrounding material, producing gamma rays.\n\nIn both cases, the gamma-ray bursts are not emitted by the black hole itself but are a result of the highly energetic processes occurring in the vicinity of the black hole."
