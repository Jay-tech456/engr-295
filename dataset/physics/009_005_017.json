    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\n\ndi = (20 * 30) / (30 + 20)\ndi = 600 / 50\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is 12 cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the magnification (M) of the mirror. The magnification can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -12 / 30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification is -0.4, which means the image is inverted and reduced in size.\n\nFinally, to find the image height (hi), we can use the formula:\n\nhi = M * ho\n\nwhere ho is the object height. However, since we don't have the object height, we can only express the image height in terms of the object height:\n\nhi = -0.4 * ho\n\nIn conclusion, the image distance is 12 cm, the magnification is -0.4, and the image height is -0.4 times the object height, indicating an inverted and reduced image."
