    "message_2": "There are several experimental observations and theoretical models that support the existence of dark matter particles. Some of the key evidence and models include:\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of stars and gas in galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass distribution. Instead, the speeds remain constant at large distances from the galactic center, suggesting the presence of an unseen mass, or dark matter, that provides additional gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations show that the mass distribution inferred from gravitational lensing often exceeds the visible mass, indicating the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Measurements of the CMB show that the universe is composed of about 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational glue that helps form these structures.\n\nSeveral theoretical models have been proposed to explain the nature of dark matter particles, including:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and have a mass in the range of 10-10,000 times the mass of a proton. They are a leading candidate for dark matter and are being searched for in various experiments.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles with very low mass and weak interactions with ordinary matter. They were initially proposed to solve a problem in particle physics known as the strong CP problem but later emerged as a potential dark matter candidate.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrinos. They could be a component of dark matter if they have the right mass and mixing properties.\n\nPhysicists are searching for dark matter particles in different experiments, such as:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei in sensitive detectors. Examples include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, XENON1T, and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS).\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in collisions between ordinary particles. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC are searching for signs of dark matter production.\n\n4. Axion searches: Experiments like the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) are specifically designed to search for axions, either produced in the laboratory or emitted by the Sun.\n\nThese experiments, along with continued astronomical observations and theoretical developments, are helping physicists to unravel the mystery of dark matter and its role in the universe."
