    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the helix is symmetric, we can consider a single turn of the helix and multiply the result by the total number of turns (50) to find the magnetic field due to the entire helix.\n\nFirst, let's find the pitch of the helix. The pitch is the distance between two consecutive turns along the helix axis. Since the helix is 10 cm long and has 50 turns, the pitch is:\n\np = 10 cm / 50 = 0.2 cm\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element dl on a single turn of the helix. The angle θ between the position vector r and the tangent to the helix at the point of the current element can be found using the pitch and radius of the helix:\n\ntan(θ) = p / (2π * radius)\nθ = arctan(p / (2π * radius))\n\nθ = arctan(0.2 cm / (2π * 2 cm)) ≈ 0.016 rad\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field dB due to the small current element dl at the point located 3 cm away from the helix's central axis, on the perpendicular bisector of the helix's axis. Using the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / |r|^2\n\nwhere |r| is the distance from the current element to the point of interest, which is 3 cm.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B due to a single turn of the helix, we need to integrate dB over the entire turn:\n\nB_single_turn = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / |r|^2\n\nSince μ₀, I, sin(θ), and |r| are constants for a single turn, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_single_turn = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) / |r|^2 * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl over a single turn is the circumference of the helix, which is 2π * radius:\n\n∫dl = 2π * 2 cm = 4π cm\n\nNow, we can find B_single_turn:\n\nB_single_turn = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * sin(0.016 rad)) / (3 cm)^2 * 4π cm\n\nB_single_turn ≈ 1.68 × 10^(-7) T\n\nFinally, we can find the total magnetic field B due to the entire helix by multiplying B_single_turn by the total number of turns (50):\n\nB = 50 * B_single_turn ≈ 50 * 1.68 × 10^(-7) T ≈ 8.4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the given point is approximately 8.4 × 10^(-6) T."
