    "message_2": "The large-scale structure of the universe is a complex, three-dimensional web-like pattern composed of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. This structure is often referred to as the \"cosmic web.\" The evolution of this structure is driven by the interplay of dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter.\n\nDark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, is the primary driver of the formation of the cosmic web. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its gravitational influence on visible matter reveals its presence. Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, with its gravitational pull attracting baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons) into the dense regions where galaxy clusters and filaments form.\n\nBaryonic matter, which makes up about 5% of the universe's total mass-energy content, follows the distribution of dark matter and forms the visible part of the cosmic web. This includes galaxies, galaxy clusters, and gas clouds. The interaction of baryonic matter through gravitational forces and other processes like radiation and supernova feedback leads to the formation of stars and galaxies.\n\nDark energy, which accounts for about 68% of the universe's total mass-energy content, is a mysterious form of energy that causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The presence of dark energy counteracts the gravitational pull of dark matter and baryonic matter, preventing the cosmic web from collapsing in on itself. As the universe expands, the cosmic web stretches and evolves, with galaxy clusters and filaments becoming more dispersed over time.\n\nThe evolution of the cosmic web can be studied through cosmological simulations, which model the behavior of dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter over time. These simulations help us understand the underlying physical processes that shape the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the three-dimensional shape of the large-scale structure of the universe is a cosmic web composed of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. This structure has evolved over time due to the interplay of dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter. Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, while baryonic matter follows its distribution to create the visible structures we observe. Dark energy counteracts the gravitational pull of matter, causing the cosmic web to expand and evolve over time."
