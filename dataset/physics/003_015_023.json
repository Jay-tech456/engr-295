    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm above the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has a side length of 10 cm, we can divide each side into small segments (current elements) and sum up the magnetic fields produced by each segment at the given point. However, due to symmetry, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by one side and multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the side length (10 cm) to find the magnetic field produced by that side at the given point:\n\nB_side = ∫dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³\n\nLet's choose a coordinate system such that the center of the square loop is at the origin, and the point we are interested in is on the positive z-axis (z = 5 cm). We can consider a small current element dl at a distance x from the center of the side (along the x-axis). The position vector r for this current element is:\n\nr = <x, 0, 5>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √(x² + 5²) = √(x² + 25)\n\nThe direction of the current element dl is along the y-axis, so dl = <0, dy, 0>. The cross product dl x r is:\n\ndl x r = <5dy, 0, -xdy>\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate along the side length:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³ = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(2 * <5dy, 0, -xdy>) / (x² + 25)^(3/2) from x = -5 to x = 5\n\nB_side = (μ₀I / 2π) * <∫(5dy) / (x² + 25)^(3/2), 0, ∫(-xdy) / (x² + 25)^(3/2)> from x = -5 to x = 5\n\nDue to symmetry, the x-component of the magnetic field will cancel out, and we only need to calculate the z-component:\n\nBz_side = -(μ₀I / 2π) * ∫(xdy) / (x² + 25)^(3/2) from x = -5 to x = 5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet u = x² + 25, then du = 2xdx\n\nBz_side = -(μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(du) / u^(3/2) from u = 0 to u = 50\n\nBz_side = -(μ₀I / 4π) * [-2 * u^(-1/2)] from u = 0 to u = 50\n\nBz_side = (μ₀I / 2π) * [√50 - √0] = (μ₀I / 2π) * √50\n\nNow we can find the total magnetic field at the given point by multiplying the magnetic field produced by one side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * Bz_side = 4 * (μ₀I / 2π) * √50\n\nB_total = (2 * μ₀I / π) * √50 = (2 * 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A / π) * √50 = 16 × 10⁻⁷ T * √50\n\nB_total ≈ 1.131 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the positive z-axis, as the x and y components cancel out due to symmetry.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located 5 cm above the center of the square loop is approximately 1.131 × 10⁻⁵ T, and its direction is along the positive z-axis."
