    "message_2": "To determine the value of the running coupling constant αs at a specific energy scale in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the perturbative approach of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), we need to use the renormalization group equation (RGE) for αs. The RGE for αs is given by:\n\ndαs / d(log μ) = - β(αs),\n\nwhere μ is the energy scale, and β(αs) is the beta function, which depends on the coupling constant αs itself. In QCD, the beta function can be expanded perturbatively as:\n\nβ(αs) = - b0 * (αs^2) / (2π) - b1 * (αs^3) / (4π^2) - b2 * (αs^4) / (64π^3) - ...,\n\nwhere b0, b1, b2, ... are the coefficients of the beta function, which depend on the number of quark flavors (nf) and the number of colors (Nc, which is 3 for QCD). The first two coefficients are given by:\n\nb0 = (11 * Nc - 2 * nf) / 3,\nb1 = (34 * Nc^2 - 10 * Nc * nf + 2 * nf * (nf - 1)) / 6.\n\nTo find the value of αs at a specific energy scale, we need to solve the RGE for αs, which is a differential equation. This can be done analytically in the leading order (LO) approximation, where we keep only the b0 term in the beta function. In this case, the solution is given by:\n\nαs(μ) = αs(μ0) / (1 + b0 * αs(μ0) * log(μ / μ0) / (2π)),\n\nwhere αs(μ0) is the value of the coupling constant at a reference energy scale μ0.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate result, we can use the next-to-leading order (NLO) or higher-order approximations, which involve more terms in the beta function. In these cases, the solution of the RGE for αs can be found numerically.\n\nTo determine the value of αs at a specific energy scale, we need to know the value of αs at a reference energy scale (αs(μ0)), the number of quark flavors (nf), and the order of the perturbative approximation (LO, NLO, etc.). With this information, we can solve the RGE for αs and find its value at the desired energy scale."
