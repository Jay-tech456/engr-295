    "message_2": "To find the maximum energy that can be gained by a proton in a particle accelerator moving at 99% of the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (99% of the speed of light) and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99^2)\nγ ≈ 7.089\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of the proton:\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = 7.089 * (938 MeV)\nE ≈ 6650 MeV\n\nThe maximum energy that can be gained by the proton in a particle accelerator moving at 99% of the speed of light is approximately 6650 MeV.\n\nTo compare this to the energy gained by the same proton in a non-relativistic accelerator, we can use the classical kinetic energy equation:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nHowever, since we are given the rest energy of the proton in MeV, it is more convenient to use the non-relativistic energy equation in terms of momentum:\n\nKE = p^2 / (2m)\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the proton and m is its rest mass.\n\nIn a non-relativistic accelerator, the proton's velocity is much less than the speed of light, so the Lorentz factor is approximately equal to 1. Therefore, the momentum of the proton is:\n\np = mv\n\nSince v = 0.99c, we have:\n\np = m * 0.99c\n\nNow, we can find the non-relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (m * 0.99c)^2 / (2m)\nKE = 0.99^2 * mc^2 / 2\nKE ≈ 0.5 * 938 MeV\nKE ≈ 469 MeV\n\nIn a non-relativistic accelerator, the proton would gain approximately 469 MeV of energy.\n\nComparing the two cases, we can see that the proton gains significantly more energy in the relativistic accelerator (6650 MeV) than in the non-relativistic accelerator (469 MeV)."
