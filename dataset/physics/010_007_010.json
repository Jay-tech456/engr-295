    "message_1": "A rectangular wooden block of dimensions 5 cm x 10 cm x 2 cm has a mass of 50 g. If the block is placed in water, what is the buoyant force acting on it? Given the density of water is 1000 kg/m³ and g = 9.8 m/s².",
    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the wooden block, we need to first find the volume of the block that is submerged in water and then use Archimedes' principle.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the wooden block:\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = (5 cm × 10 cm × 2 cm)\nVolume = 100 cm³\n\nSince we need the volume in m³ for further calculations, let's convert it:\n100 cm³ * (1 m³ / 1,000,000 cm³) = 0.0001 m³\n\n2. Use Archimedes' principle to find the buoyant force:\nArchimedes' principle states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nBuoyant force = (density of fluid) × (volume of fluid displaced) × g\n\nIn this case, the wooden block is completely submerged in water, so the volume of fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the block.\n\nBuoyant force = (density of water) × (volume of block) × g\nBuoyant force = (1000 kg/m³) × (0.0001 m³) × (9.8 m/s²)\n\nBuoyant force = 0.98 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the wooden block when placed in water is 0.98 N."
