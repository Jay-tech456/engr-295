    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of a silicon nanowire (SiNW) under the assumption of boundary scattering dominated mechanism for phonon transport, we can use the following formula:\n\nk = (π/8) * D * Λ * C * v\n\nwhere:\nk = thermal conductivity\nD = diameter of the nanowire\nΛ = mean free path of phonons\nC = specific heat capacity per unit volume\nv = average speed of sound in the material\n\nFor silicon, the following values can be used:\nC = 1.63 × 10^6 J/m^3K (specific heat capacity per unit volume)\nv = 8.43 × 10^3 m/s (average speed of sound)\n\nThe mean free path (Λ) can be estimated using the following formula for boundary scattering dominated mechanism:\n\nΛ = D/3\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nD = 10 nm = 10 × 10^-9 m\nL = 1 µm = 1 × 10^-6 m\n\nΛ = (10 × 10^-9 m) / 3 = 3.33 × 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal conductivity (k):\n\nk = (π/8) * (10 × 10^-9 m) * (3.33 × 10^-9 m) * (1.63 × 10^6 J/m^3K) * (8.43 × 10^3 m/s)\nk ≈ 0.000181 W/mK\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the silicon nanowire with a diameter of 10 nm and length of 1 µm at room temperature, assuming the boundary scattering dominated mechanism for phonon transport, is approximately 0.000181 W/mK."
