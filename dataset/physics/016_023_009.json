Explain the role of Cooper pairs in producing zero viscosity and infinite thermal conductivity in superfluid helium. Additionally, discuss the significance of the lambda transition and the critical velocity in understanding the behavior of superfluid helium in the presence of external disturbances.",
    "message_2": "Superconductivity and superfluidity are two distinct but related phenomena that occur in certain materials at very low temperatures. In the case of liquid helium-4, superfluidity emerges as a result of the unique quantum mechanical properties of the helium atoms. \n\nCooper pairs play a crucial role in both superconductivity and superfluidity. In superconductivity, Cooper pairs are formed when two electrons with opposite spins and momenta are attracted to each other through an interaction mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). These pairs of electrons then condense into a single quantum state, allowing them to move through the material without resistance. In superfluid helium-4, Cooper pairs are formed by helium atoms instead of electrons. These helium atom pairs, known as bosons, also condense into a single quantum state, giving rise to the superfluid properties of zero viscosity and infinite thermal conductivity.\n\nThe lambda transition is a phase transition that occurs in liquid helium-4 when it is cooled below a critical temperature of approximately 2.17 Kelvin. At this temperature, the helium undergoes a transition from a normal liquid state to a superfluid state. This transition is called the lambda transition because the specific heat capacity of helium-4 as a function of temperature exhibits a sharp peak resembling the Greek letter lambda (Î») at the critical temperature. The lambda transition is significant because it marks the onset of superfluidity in helium-4, and it is accompanied by a sudden change in properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.\n\nThe critical velocity is another important concept in understanding the behavior of superfluid helium in the presence of external disturbances. In a superfluid, there is a maximum velocity, called the critical velocity, below which the superfluid can flow without experiencing any resistance or dissipation. When the superfluid flows at a velocity greater than the critical velocity, it loses its superfluid properties and starts to behave like a normal fluid with finite viscosity. The critical velocity depends on factors such as temperature and the nature of the external disturbance. For example, the critical velocity is lower near the walls of a container or in the presence of impurities.\n\nIn summary, superconductivity enables superfluidity in liquid helium-4 through the formation of Cooper pairs of helium atoms, which condense into a single quantum state and give rise to the unique properties of zero viscosity and infinite thermal conductivity. The lambda transition and the critical velocity are essential concepts in understanding the behavior of superfluid helium in the presence of external disturbances, as they mark the onset of superfluidity and the limits of its resistance-free flow, respectively."
