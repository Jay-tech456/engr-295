    "message_2": "The observed relationship between the size (mass) of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar is known as the Eddington luminosity. In general, the larger the mass of the black hole, the higher the luminosity of the quasar. This is because the gravitational force of the black hole attracts more matter from its surroundings, which then forms an accretion disk around the black hole. As the matter in the accretion disk spirals inwards, it gets heated up due to friction and releases energy in the form of light, making the quasar shine brightly.\n\nThe Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity a black hole can achieve when the radiation pressure outward balances the gravitational force pulling matter inwards. This balance prevents the black hole from accreting matter at a faster rate. The Eddington luminosity is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, with the relationship given by:\n\nL_Edd = 4πGMm_p*c/σ_T\n\nwhere L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, m_p is the proton mass, c is the speed of light, and σ_T is the Thomson scattering cross-section for an electron.\n\nIn summary, the observed relationship between the size of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar is that larger black holes generally have more luminous quasars, with the maximum luminosity limited by the Eddington luminosity."
