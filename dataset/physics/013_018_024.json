    "message_2": "Cosmic ray background radiation refers to the high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The amount of cosmic ray radiation that humans are exposed to depends on several factors, including altitude, latitude, and solar activity.\n\nOn average, at sea level, humans are exposed to an effective dose rate of about 0.1 microsieverts per hour (µSv/h) from cosmic radiation. Over a day, this amounts to approximately 2.4 µSv of cosmic radiation. However, this value can be higher for people living at higher altitudes or during periods of low solar activity.\n\nProlonged exposure to cosmic ray background radiation can have potential health effects, mainly due to the ionizing nature of these high-energy particles. Ionizing radiation can cause damage to living tissue, including DNA, which can lead to an increased risk of cancer. However, the dose of cosmic radiation that humans receive on Earth is relatively low compared to other sources of natural background radiation, such as radon gas, which contributes a much larger dose.\n\nThe health risks associated with cosmic ray radiation become more significant for astronauts and frequent flyers, as the exposure increases significantly at higher altitudes and outside the Earth's protective atmosphere. For these individuals, the increased risk of cancer and other radiation-induced health effects must be carefully considered and managed.\n\nIn summary, the approximate amount of cosmic ray background radiation that humans are exposed to on a daily basis is about 2.4 µSv. While prolonged exposure to this radiation can have potential health effects, the risk is relatively low compared to other sources of natural background radiation."
