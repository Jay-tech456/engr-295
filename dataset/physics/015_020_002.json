    "message_2": "To estimate the expected rate of gravitational wave detections from a population of binary white dwarfs, we need to consider several factors, including the sensitivity of the gravitational wave observatory (X), the estimated population size of binary white dwarfs (Y), and the distance from Earth (Z). We also need to consider the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by these binary systems.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the strain amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary white dwarfs. This can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system, ω is the angular frequency of the orbit, r is the separation between the two white dwarfs, c is the speed of light, and D is the distance from the binary system to the Earth.\n\n2. Next, we need to compare the strain amplitude (h) to the sensitivity of the gravitational wave observatory (X). If h is greater than X, then the observatory should be able to detect the gravitational waves from the binary system.\n\n3. We then need to estimate the number of binary white dwarfs within the distance Z from Earth that have a strain amplitude greater than the observatory's sensitivity. This can be done by considering the estimated population size (Y) and the distribution of binary white dwarf properties (masses, separations, and distances).\n\n4. Finally, we need to estimate the rate of gravitational wave detections by considering the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves and the observation time. The frequency of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = ω / (2 * π)\n\nThe observation time depends on the duration of the observation and the duty cycle of the observatory.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the expected rate of gravitational wave detections from a population of binary white dwarfs can be estimated. However, without specific values for X, Y, and Z, we cannot provide a numerical answer."
