    "message_2": "In spiral galaxies, the distribution of dark matter and visible matter (also known as baryonic matter) is quite different. To understand this, let's first discuss the distribution of visible matter and then compare it with the distribution of dark matter.\n\nVisible matter in spiral galaxies is primarily concentrated in two main components: the disk and the bulge. The disk is a flattened, rotating structure that contains stars, gas, and dust, and it is where spiral arms are found. The bulge is a central, spheroidal region that contains older stars and is denser than the disk. The distribution of visible matter in spiral galaxies typically follows an exponential profile in the disk and a de Vaucouleurs profile in the bulge.\n\nDark matter, on the other hand, does not interact with light and is therefore not directly observable. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies. In spiral galaxies, dark matter is distributed in a more extended and diffuse manner than visible matter. It forms a roughly spherical halo that surrounds the entire galaxy, including the disk and the bulge.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies can be described by a density profile, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile or the Einasto profile. These profiles show that the density of dark matter decreases with increasing distance from the galaxy's center, but the decrease is much slower than that of visible matter. As a result, dark matter dominates the mass of a spiral galaxy at larger radii, while visible matter dominates the mass in the central regions.\n\nIn summary, the observed distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies is more extended and diffuse than that of visible matter, forming a halo that surrounds the entire galaxy. While visible matter is concentrated in the disk and the bulge, dark matter dominates the mass of the galaxy at larger radii, playing a crucial role in the dynamics and stability of spiral galaxies."
