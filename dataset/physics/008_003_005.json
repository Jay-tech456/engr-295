    "message_1": "What is the probability of a neutrino produced as a muon flavor to be detected as an electron flavor after traveling a distance of 730 km through the Earth's crust, given its initial energy and mixing angles as provided by the experiment?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we need to use the neutrino oscillation formula. The probability is given by:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nWhere:\n- P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino\n- θ is the mixing angle between the neutrino flavors\n- Δm² is the difference in the squared masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km)\n- E is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nHowever, you haven't provided the values for the initial energy (E) and mixing angles (θ). Additionally, the neutrino oscillation phenomenon involves three flavors of neutrinos and three mixing angles, which makes the calculation more complex. To provide an accurate answer, please provide the values for the initial energy and mixing angles."
