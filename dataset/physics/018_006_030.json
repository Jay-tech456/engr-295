    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter has a significant impact on galaxy rotation curves, which are plots of the orbital speeds of visible stars and gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to classical Newtonian dynamics, the orbital speed of stars should decrease as their distance from the galactic center increases. However, observations of galaxy rotation curves show that the orbital speeds of stars remain relatively constant or even increase slightly at large distances from the center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the predictions of classical dynamics is known as the galaxy rotation problem.\n\nDark matter, an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, is believed to be the key to resolving this problem. The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies can explain the observed rotation curves by providing additional gravitational force that keeps the stars moving at higher speeds than expected. The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy is typically modeled as a dark matter halo, which extends well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy.\n\nThe fact that dark matter is required to explain the observed galaxy rotation curves provides important clues about its nature. Some key insights about dark matter that can be inferred from its effects on galaxy rotation curves include:\n\n1. Dark matter is non-luminous: Since it does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, dark matter cannot be directly observed through telescopes. Its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter.\n\n2. Dark matter is abundant: Observations suggest that dark matter constitutes approximately 85% of the total matter in the universe. This means that it plays a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\n3. Dark matter is collisionless: Unlike ordinary matter, dark matter does not interact strongly with itself or other particles. This property allows dark matter to form diffuse halos around galaxies without collapsing into dense structures like stars or planets.\n\n4. Dark matter is cold: The term \"cold dark matter\" refers to the fact that dark matter particles are believed to be slow-moving, which allows them to clump together and form the large-scale structures observed in the universe.\n\nBy studying the effects of dark matter on galaxy rotation curves and other astrophysical phenomena, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the nature of dark matter and its role in the evolution of the universe. Experiments and observations are ongoing to detect dark matter particles directly or to find indirect evidence of their existence through their interactions with other particles."
