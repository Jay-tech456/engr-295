    "message_2": "To determine the thermal expansion coefficient (α) for a crystal, we need to know the change in the lattice parameter (Δa) as a function of the temperature change (ΔT). However, this information is not provided in the question. \n\nThe thermal expansion coefficient is typically given in units of (1/K) and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = (Δa / a) / ΔT\n\nwhere:\nα = thermal expansion coefficient\nΔa = change in lattice parameter\na = initial lattice parameter\nΔT = change in temperature\n\nIf you can provide the change in the lattice parameter (Δa) for the given temperature increase, we can calculate the thermal expansion coefficient."
