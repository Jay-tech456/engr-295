    "message_2": "To block half of the incident light, we need to find the angle at which the intensity of the transmitted light is half of the incident light intensity. The intensity of the transmitted light through a polarizing filter can be calculated using Malus's Law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the transmitted light intensity, I_incident is the incident light intensity, and theta is the angle between the transmission axis of the filter and the polarization direction of the incident light.\n\nSince we want to block half of the incident light, we have:\n\n0.5 * I_incident = I_incident * cos^2(theta)\n\nDividing both sides by I_incident:\n\n0.5 = cos^2(theta)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle theta:\n\ncos(theta) = sqrt(0.5)\ntheta = arccos(sqrt(0.5))\n\ntheta â‰ˆ 45 degrees\n\nSo, the polarizing filter should be rotated to an angle of approximately 45 degrees to block half of the incident light that is linearly polarized at an angle of 45 degrees to the transmission axis of the filter."
