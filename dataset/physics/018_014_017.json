    "message_1": "What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system with masses of 10 and 15 solar masses, respectively, as they spiral towards each other and eventually merge?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/8) * (1 / pi) * (1 / (M * t^2))^(3/8)\n\nwhere:\nf is the frequency of the gravitational waves\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM is the total mass of the binary system in solar masses\nt is the time until the merger\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the binary system, M:\n\nM = 10 solar masses + 15 solar masses = 25 solar masses\n\nNow, we need to convert the total mass to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nM ≈ 25 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) ≈ 4.9725 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe time until the merger, t, is not given in the problem. However, we can estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves at the moment just before the merger, known as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). For a non-spinning binary black hole system, the ISCO occurs at a distance of 6 times the total mass in units of the gravitational radius (GM/c^2).\n\nr_ISCO = 6 * (GM/c^2)\nr_ISCO ≈ 6 * ((4.9725 x 10^31 kg) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nr_ISCO ≈ 1.771 x 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can find the orbital frequency at the ISCO:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * M / r_ISCO^3)\n\nf_orbital ≈ (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (4.9725 x 10^31 kg) / (1.771 x 10^7 m)^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 2.199 x 10^-2 Hz\n\nFinally, the frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf = 2 * f_orbital\nf ≈ 2 * (2.199 x 10^-2 Hz)\nf ≈ 4.398 x 10^-2 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary black hole system just before the merger is approximately 4.398 x 10^-2 Hz."
