    "message_2": "First, we need to find the volume of the rectangular block of iron. The volume can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nVolume = 10 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm = 100 cm³\n\nNow, we need to convert the volume from cm³ to m³:\n\n1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³\n\nSo, 100 cm³ = 100 / 1,000,000 m³ = 0.0001 m³\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the iron block. We can do this using the formula:\n\nMass = Density × Volume\n\nPlugging in the given density of iron and the calculated volume:\n\nMass = 7,870 kg/m³ × 0.0001 m³ = 0.787 kg\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of the iron block. Weight can be calculated using the formula:\n\nWeight = Mass × Gravity\n\nAssuming standard gravity (9.81 m/s²):\n\nWeight = 0.787 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 7.72 N (Newtons)\n\nNext, we need to find the buoyant force acting on the iron block. Buoyant force can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBuoyant Force = Density of fluid × Volume × Gravity\n\nPlugging in the given density of water, the calculated volume, and standard gravity:\n\nBuoyant Force = 1,000 kg/m³ × 0.0001 m³ × 9.81 m/s² = 0.981 N\n\nFinally, we can find the tension in the string required to hold the block in place. The tension in the string must balance the difference between the weight of the iron block and the buoyant force acting on it:\n\nTension = Weight - Buoyant Force\n\nTension = 7.72 N - 0.981 N = 6.739 N\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string required to hold the block in place is approximately 6.739 N."
