    "message_2": "To estimate the total energy released in the form of gravitational waves during a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the radius of the star.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of our sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the star in question is:\n\nM = 20 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to estimate the radius of the star. For simplicity, let's assume the star is a massive main-sequence star with a radius proportional to its mass. The radius of our sun is approximately 6.96 x 10^8 m. Therefore, the radius of the star in question is:\n\nR = 20 * (6.96 x 10^8 m) = 1.392 x 10^10 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation to estimate the total energy released in the form of gravitational waves:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.392 x 10^10 m)\nE â‰ˆ 2.68 x 10^46 J\n\nSo, the estimated total energy released in the form of gravitational waves during the supernova explosion of a star with a mass of 20 times that of our sun is approximately 2.68 x 10^46 Joules. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual energy released can vary depending on various factors such as the star's composition, structure, and the details of the supernova explosion."
