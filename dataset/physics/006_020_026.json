    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom, we need to consider the following formula:\n\nσ_Mott = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (4 * π * ε₀ * E))² * (1 / sin²(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- σ_Mott is the Mott scattering cross section\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the two interacting particles (in this case, helium and alpha particles)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²)\n- E is the energy of the incident alpha particles (5 MeV)\n- θ is the scattering angle (30 degrees)\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy of the alpha particles from MeV to Joules:\n\nE = 5 MeV * (1.602 x 10^(-13) J/MeV) = 8.01 x 10^(-13) J\n\nNow, let's find the atomic numbers of helium and alpha particles:\n\nZ₁ (helium) = 2\nZ₂ (alpha particles) = 2\n\nNext, let's convert the scattering angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Mott scattering cross section formula:\n\nσ_Mott = (2 * 2 * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2 / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^(-12)) * (8.01 x 10^(-13))))² * (1 / sin²(π/12))\n\nσ_Mott ≈ 2.82 x 10^(-28) m²\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom when a beam of alpha particles is incident on it at an angle of 30 degrees with the energy of the alpha particles at 5 MeV is approximately 2.82 x 10^(-28) m²."
