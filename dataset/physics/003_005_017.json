    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the conductor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a long straight conductor, which is given by Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the conductor (5 A), and r is the distance from the conductor (0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) T) / (2 × 10^(-1))\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the conductor is 10 μT (microtesla)."
