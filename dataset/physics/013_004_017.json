    "message_2": "Dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, has a significant impact on gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxies or galaxy clusters. This bending of light can cause the images of distant objects to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nThe impact of dark matter on gravitational lensing is mainly due to its mass. Since dark matter is believed to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe, its gravitational influence is substantial. This means that dark matter plays a crucial role in the overall mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, which in turn affects the lensing effect they produce.\n\nWe can use the effects of gravitational lensing to detect and study the properties of dark matter in the universe in several ways:\n\n1. Weak lensing: By studying the subtle distortions in the shapes of background galaxies caused by the gravitational influence of dark matter, we can map the distribution of dark matter in the universe. This technique, known as weak lensing, allows us to infer the presence and distribution of dark matter without directly observing it.\n\n2. Strong lensing: In some cases, the gravitational influence of dark matter can be so strong that it produces multiple images or highly distorted images of background objects. By analyzing these strong lensing events, we can learn more about the mass distribution of dark matter within the lensing object, such as a galaxy cluster.\n\n3. Microlensing: Dark matter can also cause microlensing events, where the light from a distant star is temporarily magnified due to the gravitational influence of a smaller, intervening dark matter object. By monitoring these events, we can learn more about the properties of individual dark matter objects, such as their mass and size.\n\nBy studying the effects of dark matter on gravitational lensing, we can gain valuable insights into the nature of this mysterious form of matter and its role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This information is crucial for our understanding of the universe and its underlying physical laws."
