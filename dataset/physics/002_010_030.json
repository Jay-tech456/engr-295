    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water at a pressure of 1 atm (101.3 kPa) is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol. To convert this value to Joules per gram, we need to divide it by the molar mass of water.\n\nThe molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol. \n\nNow, we can convert the latent heat of vaporization to Joules per gram:\n\n(40.7 kJ/mol) / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.26 kJ/g\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we can convert the value to Joules per gram:\n\n2.26 kJ/g * 1000 J/kJ = 2260 J/g\n\nSo, the latent heat of vaporization of water at a pressure of 1 atm is approximately 2260 Joules per gram."
