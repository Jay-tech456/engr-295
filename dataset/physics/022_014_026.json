    "message_2": "It is difficult to assign a precise probability to the hypothesis that dark matter is composed of primordial black holes (PBHs) given the current astronomical data and theoretical models. However, it is considered one of the possible candidates for dark matter, although not the most favored one. The most popular candidate for dark matter is still the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).\n\nSeveral experimental studies and observations can be conducted in the future to confirm or refute the possibility of PBHs as dark matter:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: If PBHs are a significant component of dark matter, they would cause gravitational lensing of distant light sources. Observations of such lensing events, especially microlensing, could provide evidence for the existence of PBHs.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: PBHs could affect the CMB radiation through their gravitational influence on the early universe. Detailed analysis of CMB data could reveal signatures of PBHs and help determine their contribution to dark matter.\n\n3. Gravitational waves: The merging of PBHs could produce gravitational waves detectable by current and future observatories like LIGO and LISA. Observations of such events could provide insights into the abundance and properties of PBHs.\n\n4. Gamma-ray and X-ray emissions: The accretion of matter onto PBHs could produce high-energy radiation, such as gamma rays and X-rays. Detecting these emissions could help identify PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.\n\n5. Astrophysical constraints: Observations of the effects of PBHs on the formation and evolution of galaxies, star clusters, and other astrophysical objects could provide constraints on the abundance and properties of PBHs.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is challenging to assign a specific probability to the idea that dark matter is composed of primordial black holes, ongoing and future experimental studies and observations will help to either confirm or refute this possibility."
