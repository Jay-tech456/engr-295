    "message_2": "High-energy cosmic rays are energetic particles that originate from outer space and consist mainly of protons, electrons, and atomic nuclei. When these particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and other subatomic particles. These secondary particles can penetrate the Earth's surface and even reach humans.\n\nWhen high-energy cosmic rays interact with human cells, they can cause ionization, which means that they can remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating ions. This ionization process can lead to the production of free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to cellular components, including DNA.\n\nDNA damage caused by cosmic rays can lead to various types of DNA lesions, such as single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, and base modifications. These lesions can interfere with the normal functioning of DNA, such as replication and transcription, and can potentially lead to mutations. If these mutations are not repaired correctly by the cell's DNA repair mechanisms, they can accumulate over time and contribute to the development of various health problems, including cancer and other genetic disorders.\n\nLong-term exposure to high-energy cosmic rays poses a significant health risk, particularly for astronauts and individuals who spend extended periods in space. In space, the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field do not provide the same level of protection against cosmic rays as they do on the Earth's surface. As a result, astronauts are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation, which increases their risk of developing radiation-induced health problems.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, space agencies like NASA are researching ways to protect astronauts from cosmic radiation during long-duration space missions. This includes developing advanced shielding materials and technologies, as well as investigating the use of pharmaceutical countermeasures to minimize the biological effects of radiation exposure.\n\nIn summary, high-energy cosmic rays can cause ionization in human cells, leading to DNA damage and the potential for mutations. Long-term exposure to these particles increases the risk of developing health problems, such as cancer and genetic disorders. This is a particular concern for astronauts and those involved in long-duration space missions, and ongoing research aims to develop effective countermeasures to protect against these risks."
