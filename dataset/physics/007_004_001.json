If the reactor core contains 100 tons of uranium, calculate the following:\n\n1. What is the total thermal power generated by the reactor in Watts?\n2. What is the total electrical power that can be produced by the reactor in MegaWatts?\n3. If the reactor operates continuously at full power, how many days will it take to consume all the uranium in the core assuming a fuel burnup of 40 GWd/MTU?\n4. What is the total energy released by the reactor during its lifetime, assuming a burnup of 40 GWd/MTU?",
    "message_2": "1. To find the total thermal power generated by the reactor, we can use the formula:\n\nThermal Power = Electrical Power / Thermal Efficiency\n\nThermal Power = 500 MW / 0.35\n\nThermal Power = 1428.57 MW\n\nConverting to Watts:\n\nThermal Power = 1428.57 * 10^6 W = 1.42857 * 10^9 W\n\n2. The total electrical power that can be produced by the reactor is given as 500 MW.\n\n3. To find the number of days it takes to consume all the uranium in the core, we can use the formula:\n\nDays to consume uranium = (Total uranium * Fuel burnup) / (Electrical Power * 24 hours/day)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total uranium from tons to metric tons (MT):\n\nTotal uranium = 100 tons * 0.907185 MT/ton = 90.7185 MT\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days:\n\nDays to consume uranium = (90.7185 MT * 40 GWd/MTU) / (0.5 GW * 24 hours/day)\n\nDays to consume uranium = 3628.74 days\n\n4. To find the total energy released by the reactor during its lifetime, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal energy released = Total uranium * Fuel burnup\n\nTotal energy released = 90.7185 MT * 40 GWd/MTU\n\nTotal energy released = 3628.74 GWd\n\nConverting to Joules (1 GWd = 86.4 * 10^12 J):\n\nTotal energy released = 3628.74 * 86.4 * 10^12 J = 3.134 * 10^17 J"
