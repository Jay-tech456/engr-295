    "message_1": "What is the expected change in resonance frequency when a Hydrogen atom is subjected to a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla? Assume that there is no external electric field and Hydrogen atom is in its ground state. Given:\n- Nuclear spin quantum number (I) for Hydrogen nucleus = 1/2\n- Gyromagnetic ratio (γ) for Hydrogen nucleus = 42.58 MHz/T",
    "message_2": "When a hydrogen atom is subjected to a magnetic field, the resonance frequency changes due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the nuclear spin. This change in resonance frequency is called the Larmor frequency and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLarmor frequency (ν) = γ * B\n\nwhere ν is the Larmor frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) for hydrogen nucleus = 42.58 MHz/T and the magnetic field strength (B) = 1.5 T, we can calculate the Larmor frequency:\n\nν = 42.58 MHz/T * 1.5 T\n\nν = 63.87 MHz\n\nThe expected change in resonance frequency when a hydrogen atom is subjected to a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla is 63.87 MHz."
