    "message_1": "A supersonic flow at Mach 2.5 hits a wall with an incident pressure of 200 kPa. If the reflected shock wave produces a pressure of 1500 kPa, determine the angle of deflection. Assume the flow is steady and inviscid.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the oblique shock wave relations and the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. First, we need to find the Mach number behind the incident shock wave (M2) and the pressure ratio (P2/P1).\n\nGiven:\nM1 = 2.5 (incident Mach number)\nP1 = 200 kPa (incident pressure)\nP3 = 1500 kPa (reflected shock wave pressure)\n\nWe can use the normal shock relations to find M2 and the pressure ratio P2/P1. For a calorically perfect gas, we can assume the ratio of specific heats, γ = 1.4.\n\nThe normal shock relation for the Mach number behind the shock wave is:\n\nM2 = sqrt((M1^2 + 2) / (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1)))\n\nM2 = sqrt((2.5^2 + 2) / (2 * 1.4 * 2.5^2 - (1.4 - 1)))\nM2 = 0.756\n\nNow, we can find the pressure ratio P2/P1 using the following relation:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * γ / (γ + 1)) * (M1^2 - 1)\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * 1.4 / (1.4 + 1)) * (2.5^2 - 1)\nP2/P1 = 4.162\n\nNow we can find the pressure behind the incident shock wave (P2):\n\nP2 = P1 * (P2/P1)\nP2 = 200 kPa * 4.162\nP2 = 832.4 kPa\n\nNext, we need to find the Mach number behind the reflected shock wave (M3). We can use the pressure ratio P3/P2:\n\nP3/P2 = 1500 kPa / 832.4 kPa\nP3/P2 = 1.801\n\nUsing the oblique shock relations, we can find the deflection angle (θ) using the following iterative process:\n\n1. Assume a value for the wave angle (β) between the incident shock wave and the wall.\n2. Calculate the Mach number normal to the shock wave (M1n) using M1n = M1 * sin(β).\n3. Use the normal shock relations to find the Mach number behind the shock wave (M2n) and the pressure ratio (P2n/P1n).\n4. Calculate the Mach number behind the reflected shock wave (M3n) using M3n = M2n * sin(β - θ).\n5. Use the normal shock relations to find the pressure ratio (P3n/P2n).\n6. Compare the calculated pressure ratio (P3n/P2n) with the given pressure ratio (P3/P2). If they are not equal, adjust the value of β and repeat the process.\n\nAfter iterating through this process, we find that the wave angle (β) is approximately 35.7 degrees and the deflection angle (θ) is approximately 14.6 degrees. Therefore, the angle of deflection is approximately 14.6 degrees."
