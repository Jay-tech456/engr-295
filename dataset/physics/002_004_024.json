The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propane is: C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) -> 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, ΔH_f(products) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) are the standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants.\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we have:\n\nReactants: 1 mol of C3H8(g) and 5 mol of O2(g)\nProducts: 3 mol of CO2(g) and 4 mol of H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation for the reactants and products are given:\n\nΔH_f(C3H8) = -103.8 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNote that the standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol since it is in its elemental form.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = [(3 × ΔH_f(CO2)) + (4 × ΔH_f(H2O))] - [ΔH_f(C3H8) + (5 × 0)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [(3 × -393.5) + (4 × -285.8)] - [-103.8 + (5 × 0)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [-1180.5 + (-1143.2)] - (-103.8)\n\nΔH_combustion = -2323.7 + 103.8\n\nΔH_combustion = -2219.9 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane is -2219.9 kJ/mol."
