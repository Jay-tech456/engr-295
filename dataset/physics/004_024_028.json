    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and wavelength of gravitational waves produced by cosmic strings, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f) = speed of light (c) / wavelength (λ)\n2. Wavelength (λ) = 2 * length of cosmic string (L)\n3. Gravitational wave strain (h) = G * tension (T) / (c^2 * L)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), L is the characteristic length of the cosmic string, and T is the tension of the cosmic string.\n\nGiven the characteristic length L = 1 km = 1000 m and tension T = 10^18 N, we can calculate the wavelength and frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the wavelength (λ):\n\nλ = 2 * L = 2 * 1000 m = 2000 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (f):\n\nf = c / λ = (2.998 x 10^8 m/s) / 2000 m = 1.499 x 10^5 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the cosmic string is approximately 1.499 x 10^5 Hz, and the wavelength is 2000 m."
