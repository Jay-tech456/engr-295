    "message_2": "The change in the thermal conductivity of a metal as its temperature increases from room temperature to its melting point depends on the specific metal in question. Different metals have different thermal conductivity values and temperature dependencies. In general, the thermal conductivity of metals decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nTo determine the change in thermal conductivity for a specific metal, you would need to know its thermal conductivity at room temperature (k1) and its thermal conductivity at its melting point (k2). The change in thermal conductivity (Δk) can be calculated as:\n\nΔk = k2 - k1\n\nHowever, finding the exact values of k1 and k2 requires knowledge of the metal's temperature-dependent thermal conductivity function or experimental data. This information can be found in material property databases or scientific literature.\n\nFor example, let's consider copper. The thermal conductivity of copper at room temperature (20°C) is approximately 400 W/m·K. As the temperature increases, the thermal conductivity decreases. At its melting point (1085°C), the thermal conductivity is around 320 W/m·K. Therefore, the change in thermal conductivity for copper as its temperature increases from room temperature to its melting point is:\n\nΔk = 320 W/m·K - 400 W/m·K = -80 W/m·K\n\nThis means that the thermal conductivity of copper decreases by 80 W/m·K as its temperature increases from room temperature to its melting point."
