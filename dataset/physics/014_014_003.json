    "message_2": "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays at sea level is a result of the interaction of high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space with the Earth's atmosphere. The energy of these particles can range from a few million electron volts (MeV) to over 10^20 electron volts (eV). However, due to the interaction with the Earth's atmosphere, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays at sea level is significantly different from that in outer space.\n\nWhen cosmic rays enter the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with the atmospheric nuclei (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through various mechanisms, including:\n\n1. Ionization: Cosmic rays can ionize the atoms in the atmosphere, creating charged particles and secondary electrons.\n\n2. Nuclear interactions: Cosmic rays can collide with atmospheric nuclei, leading to the production of secondary particles, such as pions, kaons, and other hadrons. These secondary particles can further decay or interact with other atmospheric nuclei, creating a cascade of particles known as an \"air shower.\"\n\n3. Electromagnetic interactions: High-energy photons, such as gamma rays, can interact with the Earth's magnetic field and produce electron-positron pairs. These pairs can further interact with the atmosphere, creating more secondary particles.\n\nAt sea level, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is dominated by secondary particles produced in these interactions, such as muons, electrons, and photons. The energy spectrum can be roughly described by a power-law function:\n\ndN/dE ∝ E^(-γ)\n\nwhere dN/dE is the number of particles per unit energy interval, E is the energy of the particles, and γ is the spectral index, which is typically around 2.7 for primary cosmic rays and around 3.0 for secondary particles at sea level.\n\nIn summary, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays at sea level is a result of the interaction of high-energy particles from outer space with the Earth's atmosphere. The spectrum is dominated by secondary particles, such as muons, electrons, and photons, and can be described by a power-law function with a spectral index of around 3.0."
