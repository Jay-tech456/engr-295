    "message_2": "To find the total relativistic energy and momentum of the particle, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E): E = γmc²\n2. Relativistic momentum (p): p = γmv\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nFor v = 0.8c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow we can find the total relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc²\nE = (1.667)(1.5 GeV/c²)(c²)\nE ≈ 2.5 GeV\n\nAnd the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np = (1.667)(1.5 GeV/c²)(0.8c)\np ≈ 2.0 GeV/c\n\nSo, the total relativistic energy of the particle is approximately 2.5 GeV, and its momentum is approximately 2.0 GeV/c."
