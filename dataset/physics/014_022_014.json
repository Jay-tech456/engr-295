    "message_2": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun's corona. They can have a significant impact on the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) reaching Earth. GCRs are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outside the solar system. They constantly bombard the Earth and other objects in the solar system.\n\nThe relationship between CMEs and GCRs can be understood through the following points:\n\n1. Solar activity and modulation: The Sun's activity, including CMEs, follows an 11-year cycle known as the solar cycle. During periods of high solar activity, such as solar maximum, the number of CMEs increases. This increased solar activity leads to a stronger and more complex interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which in turn modulates the intensity of GCRs reaching the Earth. The stronger the IMF, the more it deflects and scatters GCRs, resulting in a lower intensity of GCRs reaching the Earth.\n\n2. Forbush decreases: When a CME occurs, it can cause a temporary decrease in the intensity of GCRs reaching Earth, known as a Forbush decrease. This is because the CME's magnetic field can deflect and scatter GCRs, making it more difficult for them to reach Earth. Forbush decreases typically last for a few days to a week.\n\nThe effect of GCRs from CMEs is different from those coming in from outside the solar system in the following ways:\n\n1. Origin: GCRs from CMEs are primarily of solar origin, while GCRs from outside the solar system are of extragalactic or interstellar origin. This means that the composition and energy spectrum of GCRs from CMEs can be different from those of GCRs from outside the solar system.\n\n2. Energy: GCRs from CMEs generally have lower energies compared to GCRs from outside the solar system. This is because the acceleration mechanisms in CMEs are not as efficient as those in supernova remnants or other astrophysical sources responsible for producing GCRs from outside the solar system.\n\n3. Temporal variation: The intensity of GCRs from CMEs is strongly influenced by the solar cycle and can show significant variations over short timescales (days to weeks) due to events like Forbush decreases. In contrast, the intensity of GCRs from outside the solar system is relatively stable over short timescales but can show long-term variations due to changes in the local interstellar environment and the Sun's journey through the galaxy.\n\nIn summary, coronal mass ejections on the Sun can modulate the intensity of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earth by affecting the interplanetary magnetic field and causing temporary decreases in GCR intensity. The effect of GCRs from CMEs is different from those coming in from outside the solar system in terms of their origin, energy, and temporal variation."
