    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance from a long straight conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, for a long straight conductor, Ampere's Law is more convenient. The formula for the magnetic field (B) around a straight conductor is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field in Teslas (T)\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n- I is the current in Amperes (A)\n- r is the distance from the conductor in meters (m)\n\nGiven the current (I) is 5 A and the distance (r) is 7 cm (0.07 m), we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.07 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.14 m)\n\nB ≈ 0.000142857 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 7 cm from the conductor is approximately 1.43 × 10^(-4) Teslas."
