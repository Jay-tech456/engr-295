    "message_2": "The time-independent Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the stationary states of a quantum system. For a particle in a one-dimensional box potential, we can use the time-independent Schrödinger equation to determine the probability density and energy spectrum of the particle.\n\nThe one-dimensional box potential, also known as the particle in a box or infinite square well potential, is defined as:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ L\n\nHere, L is the width of the box, and the potential is zero inside the box and infinite outside. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass m in this potential is given by:\n\n-ħ² / (2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nSince V(x) = 0 inside the box, the equation simplifies to:\n\n-ħ² / (2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. At x = 0, ψ(0) = 0, which implies B = 0. At x = L, ψ(L) = 0, which gives:\n\nA * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This condition is satisfied when kL = nπ, where n is a positive integer. Thus, the allowed wave numbers are:\n\nk_n = nπ / L, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow we can write the normalized wave function for each energy level:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(nπx / L)\n\nThe energy spectrum can be obtained by substituting k_n back into the expression for E:\n\nE_n = ħ²k_n² / (2m) = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe probability density for each energy level is given by the square of the wave function:\n\nP_n(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2 / L) * sin²(nπx / L)\n\nIn summary, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be used to determine the probability density and energy spectrum of a particle in a one-dimensional box potential. The energy spectrum is quantized, with energy levels given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²), and the probability density for each energy level is given by P_n(x) = (2 / L) * sin²(nπx / L)."
