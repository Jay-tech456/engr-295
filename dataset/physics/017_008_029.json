    "message_2": "The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a quantum phenomenon observed in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems when subjected to a strong magnetic field. The FQHE is characterized by the quantization of the Hall conductance in fractional values of e^2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is the Planck constant.\n\nThe maximum magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE depends on the specific experimental setup and the quality of the 2DEG sample. However, it is generally observed at magnetic field strengths of several Tesla (T).\n\nThe filling factor (ν) is a crucial parameter in understanding the FQHE. It is defined as the ratio of the electron density (n) to the magnetic flux density (B) divided by the magnetic flux quantum (Φ₀ = h/e):\n\nν = n * h / (e * B)\n\nThe filling factor is directly related to the magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE. In FQHE, the filling factor takes fractional values, typically of the form ν = p/q, where p and q are integers, and q is odd. The smaller the denominator (q) in the fractional filling factor, the lower the magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE. As the denominator increases, the magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE also increases.\n\nIn summary, the maximum magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE in a 2DEG system depends on the experimental setup and the quality of the sample. The filling factor plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic field strength required to observe the FQHE, with smaller fractional denominators requiring lower magnetic field strengths."
