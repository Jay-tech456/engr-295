    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the sphere, we can use Ampere's law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, we need to find the current density (J) within the sphere. Since the current I is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the sphere, we can write:\n\nJ = I / (4/3 * π * R^3)\n\nNow, let's consider a spherical surface of radius r (r < R) centered at the center of the sphere. The current enclosed by this surface can be found by integrating the current density over the volume enclosed by the surface:\n\nI_enclosed = ∫J dV = J * (4/3 * π * r^3) = I * (r^3 / R^3)\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's law. We consider a circular loop of radius r and infinitesimal width dl on the spherical surface. The magnetic field B is tangential to the loop, so the dot product B⋅dl is simply B * dl. The closed line integral of B⋅dl around the loop is then:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * ∮dl = B * (2 * π * r)\n\nApplying Ampere's law:\n\nB * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I * (r^3 / R^3)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r^2) / (2 * π * R^3)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of the sphere is:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ * I * r^2) / (2 * π * R^3)"
