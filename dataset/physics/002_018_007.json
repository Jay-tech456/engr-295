    "message_2": "To calculate the Boyle temperature, we need to use the van der Waals equation of state, which is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)^2)(V - nb) = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) in the gas sample. We can do this by using the initial conditions of the gas sample (P1 = 2 atm, V1 = 5 L, and T1 = 300 K) and the van der Waals equation:\n\n(2 + a(n/5)^2)(5 - nb) = nR(300)\n\nWe are given the values of a and b, so we can plug them into the equation:\n\n(2 + 0.12(n/5)^2)(5 - 0.055n) = n(0.0821)(300)\n\nNow we need to solve for n. This is a nonlinear equation, so it might be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate value of n. Using a numerical solver, we find that n ≈ 0.198 moles.\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can use the final conditions of the gas sample (P2 = ?, V2 = 3 L, and T2 = 300 K) and the van der Waals equation to find the final pressure (P2):\n\n(P2 + 0.12(n/3)^2)(3 - 0.055n) = n(0.0821)(300)\n\nPlugging in the value of n, we get:\n\n(P2 + 0.12(0.198/3)^2)(3 - 0.055(0.198)) = 0.198(0.0821)(300)\n\nSolving for P2, we find that P2 ≈ 3.63 atm.\n\nNow we can use Boyle's law to find the Boyle temperature (T_B). Boyle's law states that for an ideal gas, the product of pressure and volume is constant at constant temperature:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the Boyle temperature:\n\nT_B = (P2V2) / (P1V1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT_B = (3.63 atm * 3 L) / (2 atm * 5 L)\n\nT_B ≈ 1.089\n\nThe Boyle temperature of the gas sample is approximately 1.089 K."
