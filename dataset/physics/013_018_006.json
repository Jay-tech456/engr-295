    "message_2": "The average dose of cosmic ray background radiation that humans are exposed to annually is approximately 0.3 millisieverts (mSv). This value can vary depending on factors such as altitude, latitude, and solar activity. For example, people living at higher altitudes or closer to the poles are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation.\n\nThe potential health risks associated with exposure to cosmic ray background radiation are relatively low, as the annual dose is quite small compared to other sources of radiation exposure, such as medical imaging procedures or natural background radiation from the Earth. However, long-term exposure to low levels of radiation can still increase the risk of developing cancer, particularly for sensitive tissues such as bone marrow and the lungs.\n\nFor most people, the risk associated with cosmic ray background radiation is minimal and does not warrant any specific protective measures. However, for certain populations, such as astronauts or frequent flyers, the exposure to cosmic radiation can be significantly higher, and measures to reduce exposure may be necessary. Overall, the health risks associated with cosmic ray background radiation are considered to be low, but it is still important to be aware of and minimize exposure to all sources of ionizing radiation when possible."
