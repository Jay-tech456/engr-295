    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator (60) and rewrite the equation:\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/v\n\nSubtract 2/60 from both sides:\n\n1/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 60 cm. Since the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted. In a concave mirror, a real image is formed on the same side as the object."
