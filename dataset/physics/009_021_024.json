    "message_1": "What is the angle of incidence (in degrees) of unpolarized light with an intensity of 150 W/m² that is incident on a polarizing filter oriented at an angle of 37° relative to the direction of polarization? (Assuming the intensity of the polarized light that passes through the filter is 80 W/m²)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Malus's Law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) through a polarizing filter is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the direction of polarization and the plane of incidence. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_i is the intensity of the incident light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the intensity of the incident light after it passes through the first polarizer. Since the light is initially unpolarized, the first polarizer will transmit half of the intensity. Therefore, the intensity of the light after the first polarizer is:\n\nI_i = 150 W/m² * 0.5 = 75 W/m²\n\nNow, we know that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) after passing through the second polarizer is 80 W/m². We can now use Malus's Law to find the angle of incidence (θ):\n\n80 W/m² = 75 W/m² * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 75 W/m²:\n\ncos²(θ) = 80/75\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\ncos(θ) = sqrt(80/75)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(sqrt(80/75))\n\nθ ≈ 28.1°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence of the unpolarized light relative to the direction of polarization is approximately 28.1°."
