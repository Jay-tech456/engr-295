    "message_1": "Here's a precise problem for a physics student on Quantum entanglement and non-locality:\n\nA pair of particles is entangled such that their spin states are correlated. One particle is measured to be spin-up along the z-axis. What is the probability that the other particle, when measured along the x-axis, will also be spin-up? How does this result demonstrate non-locality in quantum mechanics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, let's first consider the entangled state of the two particles. Since their spin states are correlated, we can represent their combined state as a singlet state, which is given by:\n\n|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)\n\nHere, |↑↓⟩ represents the state where the first particle is spin-up and the second is spin-down, and |↓↑⟩ represents the state where the first particle is spin-down and the second is spin-up.\n\nNow, let's say the first particle is measured to be spin-up along the z-axis. This means that the second particle must be in the spin-down state along the z-axis. However, we want to find the probability that the second particle will be measured as spin-up along the x-axis.\n\nTo do this, we need to express the spin-down state of the second particle along the z-axis in terms of the x-axis basis states. The x-axis basis states are given by:\n\n|+⟩ = (1/√2) (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)\n|-⟩ = (1/√2) (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)\n\nSo, we can write the spin-down state of the second particle along the z-axis as:\n\n|↓⟩ = (1/√2) (|+⟩ - |-⟩)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that the second particle will be measured as spin-up along the x-axis. This is given by the square of the amplitude of the |+⟩ state:\n\nP(+x) = |⟨+|↓⟩|^2 = |(1/√2) (⟨+|+⟩ - ⟨+|-⟩)|^2 = (1/2)\n\nSo, the probability that the second particle will be measured as spin-up along the x-axis is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nThis result demonstrates non-locality in quantum mechanics because the measurement of the first particle along the z-axis instantaneously determines the state of the second particle along the z-axis, regardless of the distance between the two particles. This \"spooky action at a distance\" is a key feature of entangled states and is at the heart of the concept of non-locality in quantum mechanics."
