    "message_1": "A ray of light traveling in air strikes an equilateral glass prism of refractive index 1.5. If the angle of incidence is 45 degrees, what is the angle of deviation?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of deviation, we first need to find the angle of refraction at both surfaces of the prism. We can use Snell's Law for this purpose:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(i2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass), i1 is the angle of incidence, and i2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nFor the first surface:\nn1 = 1 (refractive index of air)\nn2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass)\ni1 = 45 degrees\n\n1 * sin(45) = 1.5 * sin(i2)\nsin(i2) = sin(45) / 1.5\ni2 ≈ 19.47 degrees (angle of refraction inside the prism)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle of incidence at the second surface of the prism. Since the prism is equilateral, the angle between the surfaces is 60 degrees. Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can find the angle between the refracted ray and the second surface:\n\n180 - 60 - 19.47 ≈ 100.53 degrees\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law again for the second surface:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(i2)\n\nThis time, n1 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass) and n2 = 1 (refractive index of air). We also know i1 = 100.53 degrees:\n\n1.5 * sin(100.53) = 1 * sin(i2)\nsin(i2) ≈ 0.966\ni2 ≈ 74.48 degrees (angle of refraction in air)\n\nFinally, we can find the angle of deviation. The angle of deviation is the difference between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction in air, plus the angle between the surfaces of the prism:\n\nAngle of deviation = (45 - 74.48) + 60\nAngle of deviation ≈ 30.52 degrees"
