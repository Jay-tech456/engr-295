    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic effects due to the observer's high speed (0.8c, where c is the speed of light). We will use the Lorentz transformation to find the electric field experienced by the observer.\n\nFirst, let's find the electric field at the location of the observer in the stationary frame (lab frame). The electric field E due to a point charge Q at a distance r is given by Coulomb's law:\n\nE = kQ / r^2\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (k ≈ 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge (+5 µC), and r is the distance (10 meters).\n\nE = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (5 x 10^-6 C) / (10 m)^2\nE ≈ 4.495 x 10^5 N/C\n\nNow, let's find the electric field in the observer's frame (moving frame) using the Lorentz transformation. The electric field in the moving frame (E') is related to the electric field in the stationary frame (E) by the following equation:\n\nE' = E / γ\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nThe observer is moving at 0.8c, so:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, we can find the electric field in the observer's frame:\n\nE' = E / γ\nE' ≈ (4.495 x 10^5 N/C) / 1.667\nE' ≈ 2.697 x 10^5 N/C\n\nSo, the electric field experienced by the observer traveling at 0.8c towards the stationary charge is approximately 2.697 x 10^5 N/C."
