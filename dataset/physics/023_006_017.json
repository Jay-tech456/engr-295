    "message_2": "Quantum annealing and classical annealing are two different techniques used to solve optimization problems. Quantum annealing leverages quantum mechanics, while classical annealing is based on classical physics principles. The time complexity of both methods depends on the specific optimization problem and the algorithm used.\n\nFor classical annealing, the time complexity is typically polynomial or exponential in the size of the optimization problem. The most common classical annealing algorithm is Simulated Annealing, which has a time complexity of O(n^2) for some problems, where n is the size of the problem. However, for other problems, the time complexity can be much worse, reaching exponential time complexity.\n\nQuantum annealing, on the other hand, has the potential to provide significant speedup over classical annealing for certain optimization problems. Theoretically, quantum annealing can achieve a quadratic speedup over classical annealing, which means that the time complexity could be reduced from O(n^2) to O(n) for some problems. However, this speedup is not guaranteed for all optimization problems, and the actual performance depends on the specific problem and the quality of the quantum annealer.\n\nIn practice, the time complexity of quantum annealing is still an active area of research, and the exact speedup over classical annealing is not yet well-established. As the size of the optimization problem increases, the potential advantage of quantum annealing over classical annealing may become more pronounced. However, it is important to note that current quantum annealing hardware is still in its early stages, and the performance of these devices may not yet fully reflect the theoretical potential of quantum annealing.\n\nIn summary, the time complexity of quantum annealing compared to classical annealing depends on the specific optimization problem and the algorithms used. Quantum annealing has the potential to provide significant speedup over classical annealing for certain problems, but the exact speedup and how it changes with the size of the optimization problem is still an active area of research."
