    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Stark effect formula, which describes the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of an external electric field. The formula for the linear Stark effect is:\n\nΔλ = (4 * π * e * d * E) / (m_e * c)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), d is the electric dipole moment, E is the magnitude of the electric field, m_e is the mass of the electron (9.11 × 10^(-31) kg), and c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given the wavelengths of the hydrogen atom in the Balmer series (656.3 nm and 486.1 nm) and the desired splitting distance (0.1 nm). We can use either of these wavelengths to calculate the electric field magnitude.\n\nFirst, let's convert the wavelengths and splitting distance to meters:\n\nλ1 = 656.3 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 656.3 × 10^(-9) m\nλ2 = 486.1 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 486.1 × 10^(-9) m\nΔλ = 0.1 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, let's rearrange the Stark effect formula to solve for the electric field magnitude E:\n\nE = (Δλ * m_e * c) / (4 * π * e * d)\n\nWe don't have the value of the electric dipole moment (d) for the hydrogen atom. However, we can estimate it using the Bohr radius (a_0), which is the most probable distance between the electron and the nucleus in a hydrogen atom:\n\na_0 = 5.29 × 10^(-11) m\n\nThe electric dipole moment (d) can be approximated as the product of the elementary charge (e) and the Bohr radius (a_0):\n\nd ≈ e * a_0 = (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (5.29 × 10^(-11) m) = 8.464 × 10^(-30) C·m\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nE = (0.1 × 10^(-9) m * 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (4 * π * 1.6 × 10^(-19) C * 8.464 × 10^(-30) C·m)\n\nE ≈ 2.02 × 10^5 V/m\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field required to split the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom in the Balmer series by a distance of 0.1 nm according to the Stark effect is approximately 2.02 × 10^5 V/m."
