    "message_2": "To calculate the redshift observed, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔU/c²\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔU is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given the gravitational potential difference ΔU = 6.7 x 10⁻⁹ J/kg. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.7 x 10⁻⁹ J/kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)²\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.7 x 10⁻⁹ J/kg) / (9 x 10^16 m²/s²)\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 7.44 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe redshift observed is approximately 7.44 x 10⁻²⁶. This is a very small redshift, which is expected since the altitude of the satellite is relatively low compared to the scale of the universe."
