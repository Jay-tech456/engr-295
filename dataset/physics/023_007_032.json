    "message_1": "A physics student wants to perform a quantum state tomography experiment on a qubit. The qubit is assumed to be in one of the four possible states: |0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, or |−⟩. To perform the experiment, the student applies a series of identical rotations to the qubit and measures the resulting state after each rotation. The measured state is given by a vector with real values representing the probability amplitudes of each possible state. If the student obtains the following measurement results for four different rotations:\n\nRotation 1: [0.7, 0.3]\nRotation 2: [0.2, 0.8]\nRotation 3: [0.6, -0.4]\nRotation 4: [0.8, -0.6]\n\nWhat is the initial state of the qubit before any rotations are applied?",
    "message_2": "To find the initial state of the qubit, we can use the measurement results and the fact that the rotations applied were identical. Let's denote the rotation matrix as R and the initial state as |ψ⟩. Then, the measurement results can be represented as:\n\nRotation 1: R|ψ⟩ = [0.7, 0.3]\nRotation 2: R^2|ψ⟩ = [0.2, 0.8]\nRotation 3: R^3|ψ⟩ = [0.6, -0.4]\nRotation 4: R^4|ψ⟩ = [0.8, -0.6]\n\nSince the rotations are identical, applying the rotation matrix R four times should bring the qubit back to its initial state:\n\nR^4|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩\n\nNow, we can use the measurement result from Rotation 4:\n\n[0.8, -0.6] = |ψ⟩\n\nHowever, we need to normalize this vector to make sure the probabilities sum up to 1. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components:\n\nNormalization factor = √(0.8^2 + (-0.6)^2) = √(0.64 + 0.36) = √1 = 1\n\nSince the normalization factor is 1, the initial state of the qubit is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [0.8, -0.6]\n\nThis state does not correspond exactly to any of the four given states (|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, or |−⟩), but it is a valid quantum state. The initial state of the qubit is a superposition of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ with the coefficients 0.8 and -0.6, respectively."
