    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron, E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, and W is the work function of the cesium atom.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy of the incident photon. We can do this using the equation:\n\nE_photon = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the ultraviolet light (225 nm).\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (225 x 10^(-9) m)\nE_photon = 8.83 x 10^(-19) J\n\nTo convert the energy of the photon from joules to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J:\n\nE_photon = (8.83 x 10^(-19) J) / (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV)\nE_photon ≈ 5.51 eV\n\nNow we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron using the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W\nK_max = 5.51 eV - 1.95 eV\nK_max ≈ 3.56 eV\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron from a cesium atom under the given conditions is approximately 3.56 eV."
