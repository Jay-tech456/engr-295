    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 2 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength (B) around a straight wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (2 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (10 cm = 0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nB = (8 × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 4 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the straight wire carrying a current of 2 A is 4 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
