    "message_2": "In an ideal supersymmetric model, each particle has a superpartner with the same quantum numbers but differing by spin 1/2 unit. The superpartners of quarks are called squarks. Let's denote the superpartner of the top quark as stop (t~) and the superpartner of the bottom quark as sbottom (b~).\n\nGiven the masses of the top quark (m_t) and the bottom quark (m_b) as 173.1 GeV/c² and 4.18 GeV/c², respectively, we need to find the mass difference between their superpartners. However, the problem does not provide enough information to directly calculate the masses of the stop and sbottom squarks.\n\nIn a realistic supersymmetric model, the masses of the superpartners are determined by several factors, including the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. These factors are not given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot calculate the mass difference between the stop and sbottom squarks in this supersymmetric model."
