    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), vacuum polarization refers to the process where a virtual electron-positron pair is created in the vicinity of an external electric field, such as that produced by an electron-positron pair separated by a distance r. The vacuum polarization can be quantified by the Uehling potential, which is a correction to the Coulomb potential between the electron and positron.\n\nThe Uehling potential, V(r), can be expressed in terms of the fine structure constant α, the electron mass m, and Planck's constant h as follows:\n\nV(r) = - (α * h * c) / r * (1 + (α / (2 * π)) * (1 - e^(-2 * m * c^2 * r / (h * c))))\n\nHere, c is the speed of light, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe vacuum polarization is a small correction to the Coulomb potential, and its value depends on the distance r between the electron and positron. The term (α / (2 * π)) * (1 - e^(-2 * m * c^2 * r / (h * c))) represents the correction due to vacuum polarization."
