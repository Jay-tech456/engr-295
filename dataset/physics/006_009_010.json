    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of a photon after a Compton scattering event, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ' is the scattered photon wavelength, λ is the incident photon wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the scattering angle (θ). We can use the conservation of momentum to find the angle between the initial and final momentum of the electron. The initial momentum of the electron (p_e) is given as 0.5 MeV/c, which we can convert to kg m/s:\n\np_e = 0.5 MeV/c * (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV) * (1/c)\np_e = 0.5 * 1.602 x 10^-13 kg m/s\n\nThe momentum of the incident photon (p_i) can be calculated using the formula:\n\np_i = h/λ\n\nwhere λ is the incident photon wavelength (200 nm).\n\np_i = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (200 x 10^-9 m)\np_i = 3.313 x 10^-27 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of momentum to find the final momentum of the electron (p'_e) and the angle (θ):\n\np'_e = sqrt(p_e^2 + p_i^2 + 2 * p_e * p_i * cos(θ))\n\nWe can solve for cos(θ) using the above equation:\n\ncos(θ) = (p'_e^2 - p_e^2 - p_i^2) / (2 * p_e * p_i)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of θ. In general, the change in wavelength (Δλ) depends on the scattering angle (θ). The maximum change in wavelength occurs when the photon is scattered at 180 degrees (backscattered). In this case, cos(θ) = -1, and the Compton formula becomes:\n\nΔλ_max = 2 * (h/(m_e * c))\n\nΔλ_max = 2 * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s)\nΔλ_max ≈ 4.86 x 10^-12 m\n\nThis is the maximum change in wavelength for the given incident photon wavelength and initial electron momentum. The actual change in wavelength will depend on the scattering angle, which we cannot determine with the given information."
