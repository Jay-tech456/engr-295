    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field generated by a solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/m), and I is the current (A).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the solenoid has 50 turns of wire and a length of 20 cm (0.2 m), we can calculate n as follows:\n\nn = 50 turns / 0.2 m = 250 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B) inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (250 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 6.28 × 10^(-4) T.\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field outside the solenoid axis at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center. The magnetic field outside a solenoid is much weaker than inside, and it can be approximated as the magnetic field generated by a magnetic dipole. The magnetic field (B_out) at a distance r from the center of the solenoid is given by:\n\nB_out = (μ₀ * m * R^2) / (4π * (r^2 + R^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere m is the magnetic dipole moment, R is the radius of the solenoid, and r is the distance from the center of the solenoid.\n\nThe magnetic dipole moment (m) can be calculated as:\n\nm = n * I * π * R^2\n\nUsing the given values, we can calculate m:\n\nm = (250 turns/m) * (2 A) * π * (0.05 m)^2\nm ≈ 0.3927 Am^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B_out) at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center:\n\nB_out = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.3927 Am^2) * (0.05 m)^2 / (4π * (0.1 m^2 + 0.05 m^2)^(3/2))\nB_out ≈ 1.96 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field outside the solenoid axis at a distance of 10 cm from the center is approximately 1.96 × 10^(-7) T."
