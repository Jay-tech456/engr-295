    "message_2": "The effect of an external electric field on the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms is known as the Stark effect. The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. It is the electric analogue of the Zeeman effect, where spectral lines are split due to an external magnetic field.\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom is subjected to an external electric field, the energy levels of the atom are perturbed, leading to a change in the energy levels of the electron orbitals. This results in a shift and splitting of the spectral lines corresponding to the transitions between these energy levels.\n\nThe strength of the electric field affects the magnitude of the Stark effect. As the strength of the electric field increases, the splitting and shifting of the spectral lines become more pronounced. In the linear Stark effect, the shift in the energy levels is proportional to the strength of the electric field. However, in the quadratic Stark effect, the shift in the energy levels is proportional to the square of the electric field strength.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen atoms, the Stark effect can be analyzed using the semiclassical perturbation theory. For low electric field strengths, the quadratic Stark effect dominates, and the energy level shifts are proportional to the square of the electric field strength. As the electric field strength increases, the linear Stark effect becomes more significant, and the energy level shifts become proportional to the electric field strength.\n\nIn summary, the Stark effect causes the shifting and splitting of the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms in the presence of an external electric field. The strength of the electric field affects the magnitude of this effect, with the energy level shifts being proportional to the electric field strength or its square, depending on the field strength and the specific energy levels involved."
