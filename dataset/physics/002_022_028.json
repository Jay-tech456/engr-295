The vapor pressure of pure benzene is 100 torr, and the experimentally determined vapor pressure of the solution is 80 torr. The vapor pressure of pure toluene is 50 torr, and its mole fraction in the solution is 0.8. Assume that the solution behaves ideally. What is the activity coefficient of Benzene?",
    "message_2": "In an ideal solution, the activity coefficient (γ) is equal to 1. Since we are assuming that the solution behaves ideally, we can use Raoult's Law to calculate the activity coefficient of Benzene.\n\nRaoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in a solution is equal to the product of its mole fraction (x) and its vapor pressure in the pure state (P°):\n\nP = x * P°\n\nFor Benzene in the solution:\n\nP_Benzene = x_Benzene * P°_Benzene\n\nThe experimentally determined vapor pressure of the solution is given as 80 torr. We can use this value to find the partial pressure of Benzene in the solution:\n\nP_Benzene = 0.2 * 100 torr = 20 torr\n\nNow, we can calculate the activity coefficient (γ) of Benzene using the following equation:\n\nγ = P / (x * P°)\n\nγ_Benzene = P_Benzene / (x_Benzene * P°_Benzene)\n\nγ_Benzene = 20 torr / (0.2 * 100 torr)\n\nγ_Benzene = 20 / 20\n\nγ_Benzene = 1\n\nSince the solution behaves ideally, the activity coefficient of Benzene is 1."
