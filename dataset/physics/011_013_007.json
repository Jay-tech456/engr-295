    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nThe diameter of the wire is given as 2 mm, so the radius (r) is 1 mm or 0.001 m. The cross-sectional area of the wire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = πr^2\n\nA = π × (0.001 m)^2\nA ≈ 3.1416 × 10^-6 m^2\n\nNow we can calculate the resistance of the wire:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm) × (0.5 m) / (3.1416 × 10^-6 m^2)\nR ≈ 2.65 × 10^-3 Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nSince we know the resistivity (ρ) of copper is 1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm, we can find the conductivity:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10^7 S/m\n\nSo the electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.95 × 10^7 S/m."
