    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K_eq)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), and K_eq is the equilibrium constant.\n\nFirst, let's convert the equilibrium constant (K_eq) using the initial concentration of the substrate:\n\nK_eq = [products]/[substrate]\n10⁴ = [products]/(0.1 M)\n\nNow, we can solve for the concentration of products:\n\n[products] = 10⁴ * (0.1 M) = 1000 M\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG):\n\nΔG = - (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) * ln(10⁴)\nΔG ≈ - (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) * (9.21)  (since ln(10⁴) ≈ 9.21)\nΔG ≈ -22,800 J/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction at 25°C with an initial substrate concentration of 0.1 M and an equilibrium constant of 10⁴ is approximately -22,800 J/mol."
