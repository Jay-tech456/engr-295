    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They have been proposed as a candidate for explaining the observed dark matter in the universe.\n\nThe minimum mass of a primordial black hole that could be a candidate for explaining the observed dark matter depends on several factors, including the density of dark matter in the universe and the fraction of dark matter that could be composed of PBHs. However, it is generally believed that the minimum mass of a PBH that could contribute significantly to the dark matter density is around 10^(-8) solar masses (where one solar mass is the mass of our Sun, approximately 2 x 10^(30) kg).\n\nOn the other hand, the maximum mass predicted by current theories of black hole formation depends on the specific model of PBH formation and the conditions in the early universe. Some models predict that PBHs could have masses up to several tens of solar masses, while others suggest that they could be even more massive, up to thousands or millions of solar masses.\n\nIt is important to note that the existence of primordial black holes as a significant component of dark matter is still a matter of debate and ongoing research. Observational constraints from various astrophysical and cosmological probes have ruled out certain mass ranges for PBHs as the dominant component of dark matter. However, there is still no definitive evidence for or against the existence of PBHs in the mass ranges that are not yet constrained."
