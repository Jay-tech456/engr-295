    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the rate of diffusion of molecules through a cell membrane is that as temperature increases, the rate of diffusion also increases. This is because the molecules have more kinetic energy at higher temperatures, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently with the cell membrane. As a result, the probability of molecules passing through the membrane increases, leading to a higher rate of diffusion.\n\nThe Arrhenius equation can be used to model the effect of temperature on the rate of diffusion. The equation is as follows:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the rate constant of the diffusion process\n- A is the pre-exponential factor, which is a constant specific to the system being studied\n- Ea is the activation energy, which is the energy required for the molecules to overcome the barrier and diffuse through the membrane\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nThe Arrhenius equation shows that the rate constant (k) is directly proportional to the temperature (T). As the temperature increases, the exponential term e^(-Ea/RT) becomes larger, leading to an increase in the rate constant (k). This means that the rate of diffusion increases with temperature.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the rate of diffusion of molecules through a cell membrane can be modeled using the Arrhenius equation, which demonstrates that the rate of diffusion increases as temperature increases."
