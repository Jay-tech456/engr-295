    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are a proposed form of dark matter that could explain the observed effects of gravitational lensing in the Milky Way galaxy. These objects are thought to be composed of ordinary baryonic matter, such as brown dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes, and are located in the galactic halo.\n\nThe mass range of MACHOs required to explain the observed effects of gravitational lensing in the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be between 0.1 and 100 solar masses. However, recent studies have suggested that MACHOs with masses greater than 10 solar masses are less likely to be the primary source of dark matter in the galaxy.\n\nAs for the abundance of MACHOs, it is difficult to provide a precise number, but it is estimated that they should make up a significant fraction of the total dark matter mass in the Milky Way galaxy. However, recent surveys and observations have not found enough MACHOs to account for all the dark matter in the galaxy, leading to the conclusion that MACHOs may only contribute a small fraction of the total dark matter mass.\n\nIn summary, while MACHOs with a mass range of 0.1 to 100 solar masses could potentially explain the observed effects of gravitational lensing in the Milky Way galaxy, their abundance is likely not sufficient to account for all the dark matter in the galaxy. Other forms of dark matter, such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) or axions, are currently being investigated as alternative explanations for the observed gravitational lensing effects."
