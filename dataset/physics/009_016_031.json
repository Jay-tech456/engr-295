    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 632.8 nm is diffracted through a single slit, creating a diffraction pattern on a screen placed 2 meters away. If the width of the slit is 0.1 mm, what is the distance between the central maximum and the second minimum in the diffraction pattern?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central maximum and the second minimum in the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum, m = 2 for the second minimum, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFor this problem, we have:\n\nm = 2 (since we want the second minimum)\nλ = 632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nθ = (2 * 632.8 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nθ ≈ 1.2656 * 10^(-2) radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance y between the central maximum and the second minimum on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slit and the screen (2 meters in this case).\n\ny ≈ 2 * 1.2656 * 10^(-2)\ny ≈ 0.025312 meters\n\nSo the distance between the central maximum and the second minimum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.025312 meters or 25.312 mm."
