    "message_2": "To calculate the work done on the gas during this process, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nIn this case, the pressure P is 2 atm, the initial volume V1 is 10 L, and the final volume V2 is 5 L. The change in volume ΔV is:\n\nΔV = V2 - V1 = 5 L - 10 L = -5 L\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nW = - (2 atm) * (-5 L)\n\nW = 10 L * atm\n\nHowever, it's common to express work in the unit of joules (J). To convert L * atm to joules, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 L * atm ≈ 101.3 J\n\nSo, the work done on the gas is:\n\nW ≈ 10 L * atm * (101.3 J / 1 L * atm) = 1013 J\n\nTherefore, approximately 1013 joules of work is done on the gas during this process."
