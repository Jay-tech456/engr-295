    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the total mass of the binary system in kilograms, ω is the angular frequency of the orbit in radians per second, r is the distance from the source to the observer in meters, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg\nM2 = 5 solar masses = 5 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 9.945 × 10³⁰ kg\n\nThe total mass of the binary system is:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg + 9.945 × 10³⁰ kg = 2.984 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency of the orbit, ω. This can be estimated using Kepler's third law:\n\nω = √(G * (M1 + M2) / a³)\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. However, we don't have enough information to determine the semi-major axis or the angular frequency directly.\n\nAdditionally, we need to convert the distance from the source to the observer from light years to meters. One light year is approximately 9.461 × 10¹⁵ meters. So, the distance is:\n\nr = 1 billion light years = 1 × 10⁹ * 9.461 × 10¹⁵ m = 9.461 × 10²⁴ m\n\nWithout the angular frequency ω, we cannot calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves directly. However, if we had the angular frequency, we could plug the values into the formula and find the amplitude h."
