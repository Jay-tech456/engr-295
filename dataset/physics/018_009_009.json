    "message_2": "The temperature of a black hole is determined by its Hawking temperature, which is inversely proportional to its mass. The Hawking temperature (T_H) of a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT_H = (ħc^3) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a rotating black hole, the temperature depends on its angular momentum (J) as well. The temperature of a Kerr black hole (rotating black hole) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT_H = (ħc^3) / (4πGMk_B * (1 + sqrt(1 - (J^2 / (GM^2/c^2)))))\n\nThe maximum temperature occurs when the black hole is extremal, meaning it has the maximum possible angular momentum for a given mass, which is J = GM^2/c. In this case, the temperature becomes:\n\nT_H = (ħc^3) / (2πGMk_B)\n\nNow, let's calculate the entropy of the black hole. The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\n\nS = (kc^3A) / (4ħG)\n\nwhere A is the surface area of the event horizon. For a Schwarzschild black hole, the surface area is given by:\n\nA = 16πG^2M^2 / c^4\n\nFor a Kerr black hole, the surface area is given by:\n\nA = 8πG^2M^2 / c^4 * (1 + sqrt(1 - (J^2 / (GM^2/c^2))))\n\nThe maximum entropy occurs when the black hole is extremal, and the surface area becomes:\n\nA = 8πG^2M^2 / c^4\n\nSo, the maximum entropy is:\n\nS_max = (kc^3 * 8πG^2M^2 / c^4) / (4ħG) = 2πkGM^2 / ħc\n\nIn summary, the maximum temperature and entropy of a black hole at the event horizon depend on its mass and angular momentum. The maximum temperature occurs when the black hole is extremal, with a temperature of (ħc^3) / (2πGMk_B). The maximum entropy occurs at the same extremal condition, with an entropy of 2πkGM^2 / ħc."
