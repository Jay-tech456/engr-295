    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime near a massive object affects the trajectory of a photon passing by it through a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This occurs because the presence of a massive object, such as a star or a galaxy, causes spacetime to curve around it, according to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nWhen a photon (a light particle) travels through this curved spacetime, its path is also bent or deflected. This bending of light is analogous to the refraction of light when it passes through a medium with a different refractive index, like when light passes through a glass lens. In the case of gravitational lensing, the mass of the object acts as a \"lens\" that bends the light's path.\n\nThe amount of deflection depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the photon and the massive object. The greater the mass and the closer the photon's path is to the object, the more the photon's trajectory will be bent.\n\nThis phenomenon has been experimentally confirmed through observations of stars near the edge of the Sun during a solar eclipse, where the stars' apparent positions were shifted due to the Sun's gravitational influence on the light coming from those stars. Gravitational lensing is also used in astronomy to study distant galaxies and galaxy clusters, as well as to detect the presence of dark matter."
