    "message_2": "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays that affect the interstellar medium spans a wide range, from about 10^9 eV (electron volts) to over 10^20 eV. Cosmic rays are primarily composed of protons (~90%), alpha particles (~9%), and a small fraction of heavier nuclei and electrons.\n\nThe energy spectrum can be described by a power-law function:\n\ndN/dE ∝ E^(-γ)\n\nwhere dN is the number of cosmic rays with energy between E and E + dE, and γ is the spectral index, which is typically around 2.7 for lower energies (below the \"knee\" at ~10^15 eV) and steepens to around 3.1 for higher energies (above the \"knee\").\n\nCosmic rays interact with magnetic fields as they propagate through the galaxy. Due to their charged nature, cosmic rays are deflected by the galactic magnetic fields, causing them to follow a random walk-like trajectory. This process is known as cosmic ray diffusion. The diffusion coefficient (D) depends on the energy of the cosmic rays and the strength of the magnetic field. Higher energy cosmic rays are less affected by the magnetic fields and can propagate more easily through the galaxy.\n\nThe expected flux density of cosmic rays of different energies can be determined using the power-law function mentioned above. For example, at 1 GeV (10^9 eV) energy, the flux density is about 1.8 x 10^4 particles per m^2 per second per steradian. The flux density decreases with increasing energy, reaching about 1 particle per m^2 per year per steradian at 10^15 eV (the \"knee\" of the spectrum).\n\nThe spatial distribution of energetic particles in the interstellar medium is influenced by several factors, including the distribution of cosmic ray sources (e.g., supernova remnants), the galactic magnetic field, and the diffusion process. In general, cosmic rays are more concentrated in the galactic disk, where most of the sources are located, and their density decreases with increasing distance from the disk. The distribution also depends on the energy of the cosmic rays, with higher energy particles being less affected by the magnetic fields and having a more uniform distribution throughout the galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays affecting the interstellar medium is broad, ranging from 10^9 eV to over 10^20 eV, and follows a power-law function. Cosmic rays interact with magnetic fields as they propagate through the galaxy, resulting in a diffusion process that depends on their energy and the strength of the magnetic field. The expected flux density of cosmic rays decreases with increasing energy, and the spatial distribution of energetic particles is influenced by the distribution of sources, the galactic magnetic field, and the diffusion process."
