    "message_2": "To calculate the expected output frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Characteristic strain amplitude (h_c): h_c = (4 * G^(5/3) * pi^(2/3) * (M1 * M2)^(2/5) * f_GW^(2/3)) / (c^4 * d)\n\nWhere:\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes\n- r is the distance between the black holes\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- d is the distance from the observer to the binary system (this value is needed only for the amplitude calculation)\n\nGiven that one black hole mass is double the mass of the other, let's denote the masses as M1 = M and M2 = 2M. The distance between the black holes is given as 500 km (5 x 10^5 m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M + 2M) / r^3)\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * 3M / (5 x 10^5 m)^3)\n\nNow, let's calculate the gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n\nFinally, let's calculate the characteristic strain amplitude (assuming a distance d from the observer to the binary system):\n\nh_c = (4 * G^(5/3) * pi^(2/3) * (M * 2M)^(2/5) * f_GW^(2/3)) / (c^4 * d)\n\nIt's important to note that we cannot provide specific numerical values for f_GW and h_c without knowing the actual masses of the black holes (M) and the distance from the observer to the binary system (d). However, the formulas above can be used to calculate the expected output frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves for any given values of M and d."
