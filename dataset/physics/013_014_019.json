    "message_2": "The maximum distance that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) can detect a gravitational wave signal depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the strength of the gravitational wave source. For binary neutron star mergers, which are relatively weak sources, LIGO's detection range is up to about 130 million light-years (40 Mpc) away. For more massive events, such as binary black hole mergers, LIGO can detect gravitational waves from sources as far as several billion light-years away. However, it is important to note that the detection range can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the gravitational wave signal and the noise level in the detectors at the time of observation."
