    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -15 cm (concave lens)\nu = 30 cm (object distance)\n\nWe can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-15) = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-15) - 1/30\n1/v = -2/30\nv = -30/2\nv = -15 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is -15 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is typical for a concave lens.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (m):\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nm = -(-15)/30\nm = 15/30\nm = 0.5\n\nThe magnification is 0.5, which means the image is half the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright."
