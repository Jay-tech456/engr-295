    "message_1": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, a laser with a wavelength of 650 nm is used to produce an interference pattern on a screen placed 2 meters away. The distance between the two slits is 0.25 mm and the screen is positioned such that the distance between the central bright fringe and the fourth bright fringe is 8 cm. What is the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the distance between adjacent bright fringes (also known as the fringe spacing) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFringe spacing (Δy) = (λ * L) / d\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\nL = 2 m\nd = 0.25 mm = 0.25 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow we can calculate the fringe spacing:\n\nΔy = (650 * 10^(-9) * 2) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\nΔy ≈ 0.0052 m = 5.2 mm\n\nHowever, this is the fringe spacing between the central bright fringe and the first bright fringe. The problem states that the distance between the central bright fringe and the fourth bright fringe is 8 cm. To find the distance between adjacent bright fringes, we need to divide this distance by the number of fringes between the central and fourth bright fringe:\n\nNumber of fringes = 4\nDistance between adjacent bright fringes = (8 cm) / 4\nDistance between adjacent bright fringes = 2 cm\n\nSo, the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen is 2 cm."
