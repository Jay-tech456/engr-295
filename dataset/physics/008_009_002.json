    "message_2": "The critical temperature at which the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition occurs in the early Universe is approximately 150-170 MeV (million electron volts), which corresponds to about 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin.\n\nAt this critical temperature, the Universe undergoes a phase transition from a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to a hadronic phase. The quark-gluon plasma is a state of matter where quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons, are not confined within individual particles but instead move freely in a high-energy, high-temperature environment.\n\nAs the Universe expands and cools down, it reaches the critical temperature for the QCD phase transition. At this point, quarks and gluons start to combine and form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. This process is called hadronization. The formation of hadrons is a crucial step in the evolution of the Universe, as it sets the stage for the formation of atomic nuclei during the process of nucleosynthesis, which occurs at a later stage when the temperature drops further.\n\nThe QCD phase transition also affects the production of other subatomic particles, such as mesons (composed of a quark and an antiquark) and baryons (composed of three quarks). These particles are formed as a result of the strong nuclear force, which is described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics.\n\nUnderstanding the QCD phase transition and its effects on the formation of hadrons and other subatomic particles is essential for studying the early Universe's evolution and the formation of the matter we observe today."
