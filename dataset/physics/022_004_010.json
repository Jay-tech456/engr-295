    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in determining the shape and rotation curve of galaxies, as well as influencing the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe. Although dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, it can be detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n1. Shape and rotation curve of galaxies: The presence of dark matter in galaxies helps explain the observed flat rotation curves. According to Newtonian dynamics, the rotation velocity of stars and gas in a galaxy should decrease as we move away from the galactic center. However, observations show that the rotation velocity remains roughly constant, even at large distances from the center. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, which provides additional gravitational force to keep the outer stars and gas moving at a constant speed. The dark matter halo also influences the overall shape of the galaxy, as its gravitational pull helps to maintain the stability of the galactic disk and the spiral arms.\n\n2. Distribution of dark matter and galaxy formation: Dark matter plays a vital role in the formation of galaxies in the universe. In the early universe, dark matter formed the backbone of the cosmic web, a large-scale structure composed of dark matter filaments and voids. These filaments attracted baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons) through gravitational forces, leading to the formation of dense regions where gas could cool and condense to form stars and galaxies. The distribution of dark matter in the universe, therefore, directly affects the distribution of galaxies and their formation.\n\n3. Evolution of galaxies: Dark matter also influences the evolution of galaxies over time. The gravitational interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter drives the merging of galaxies, leading to the formation of larger galaxies and galaxy clusters. Additionally, dark matter halos provide a stabilizing influence on galaxies, preventing them from being disrupted by tidal forces during these mergers. Dark matter also plays a role in the growth of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, as its gravitational pull helps to funnel gas and other material towards the black hole, fueling its growth.\n\nIn summary, dark matter is a key component in shaping the properties and behavior of galaxies, from their formation and evolution to their rotation curves and overall structure. The distribution of dark matter in the universe has a significant impact on the formation and distribution of galaxies, as well as the large-scale structure of the cosmos."
