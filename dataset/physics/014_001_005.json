    "message_2": "The most compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from various independent observations that suggest the presence of unseen mass in the universe. Some of the key observations include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This implies the presence of additional, unseen mass (dark matter) that provides the extra gravitational force needed to explain these high velocities.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, is another strong evidence for dark matter. The observed lensing effect is often stronger than what can be accounted for by the visible mass alone, suggesting the presence of additional mass in the form of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the distribution of matter in the early universe. The observed pattern of fluctuations is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the growth of cosmic structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the influence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps form these large-scale structures.\n\nLeading theories for the composition of dark matter include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter and radiation. They are considered a leading candidate for dark matter because they naturally arise in some extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are another hypothetical particle that could make up dark matter. They are predicted to be very light and interact extremely weakly with other particles, making them difficult to detect.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: These are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrinos. They could be a component of dark matter if they have a mass and mix with ordinary neutrinos.\n\nFuture detection methods for dark matter include:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles as they interact with ordinary matter in highly sensitive detectors. Examples include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the XENON1T experiment.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples include the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), could potentially produce dark matter particles in collisions between known particles, providing indirect evidence for their existence.\n\n4. Astrophysical observations: Continued observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and large-scale structure formation can provide further evidence for dark matter and help constrain its properties.\n\n5. Axion and sterile neutrino searches: Dedicated experiments, such as the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) and the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment, aim to detect or constrain the properties of axions and sterile neutrinos, respectively."
