    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the current-carrying wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x is the unit vector in the direction of r.\n\nSince the loop is circular and the current is uniformly distributed, we can consider a small segment of the loop with an angle dθ. The length of this segment is given by:\n\ndl = R * dθ\n\nNow, let's find the position vector r. The distance from the small segment to point P is:\n\nr = sqrt(R^2 + x^2)\n\nThe angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product dl x r simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r^3\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field at point P, we need to find the z-component of the magnetic field, dBz. To do this, we can use the angle α between the position vector r and the z-axis:\n\ncos(α) = x / r\n\nSo, dBz = dB * cos(α) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r * x) / (r^4)\n\nNow, we need to integrate dBz over the entire loop to find the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nBz = ∫ dBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * x * ∫ (dl * r) / r^4\n\nSince r and x are constant for a given point P, we can integrate over the angle θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * x * ∫ (R * dθ * r) / r^4 = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * x * R * ∫ dθ / r^3\n\nThe integral of dθ from 0 to 2π is simply 2π, so:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * x * R * 2π / r^3\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nThis is the magnetic field at point P located a distance x above the center of the circular loop of radius R carrying a current I."
