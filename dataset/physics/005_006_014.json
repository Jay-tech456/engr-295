(Assume the Earth has a mass of 5.97 x 10^24 kg and a radius of 6.37 x 10^6 m, and that the building is located at sea level.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the difference in frequency between a clock on the surface of the Earth and a clock on top of a 100-meter tall building, we need to consider the gravitational redshift effect predicted by the theory of general relativity (not special relativity). The formula for gravitational redshift is given by:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔU)/c^2\n\nwhere Δf is the difference in frequency, f is the initial frequency, ΔU is the difference in gravitational potential energy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in gravitational potential energy between the two clocks. The gravitational potential energy is given by:\n\nU = -GMm/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the Earth (5.97 x 10^24 kg), m is the mass of the object (in this case, the clock), and r is the distance from the center of the Earth to the object.\n\nFor the clock on the surface of the Earth, r1 = Earth's radius = 6.37 x 10^6 m. For the clock on top of the building, r2 = Earth's radius + building height = (6.37 x 10^6 + 100) m. The difference in gravitational potential energy is:\n\nΔU = U2 - U1 = GMm(1/r1 - 1/r2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔf/f = (GM(1/r1 - 1/r2))/c^2\n\nAssuming an initial frequency f, we can find the difference in frequency Δf:\n\nΔf = f(GM(1/r1 - 1/r2))/c^2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔf = f(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.97 x 10^24 kg * (1/(6.37 x 10^6 m) - 1/((6.37 x 10^6 + 100) m)))/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔf ≈ 1.11 x 10^-16 * f\n\nThe difference in frequency between the two clocks is approximately 1.11 x 10^-16 times the initial frequency. This is a very small difference, but it is measurable with precise instruments."
