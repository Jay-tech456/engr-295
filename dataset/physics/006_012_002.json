    "message_2": "To calculate the ionization energy required to remove the outermost electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state, we can use the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (for hydrogen, Z = 1), and n is the principal quantum number (for the ground state, n = 1).\n\nFor hydrogen in its ground state (n = 1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE_1 = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from its current energy level to an infinitely far distance (n = ∞). Therefore, we can calculate the ionization energy by finding the difference in energy between the ground state and the state with n = ∞:\n\nIonization Energy = E_∞ - E_1\n\nSince the energy at n = ∞ is 0 eV (electron is infinitely far from the nucleus):\n\nIonization Energy = 0 eV - (-13.6 eV)\nIonization Energy = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy required to remove the outermost electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
