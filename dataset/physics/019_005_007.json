    "message_2": "The decay rate of a fermion into two other fermions via the exchange of a virtual boson can be described using the Fermi's Golden Rule. The expression for the decay rate (Γ) is given by:\n\nΓ = (1 / 2m) * ∫ |M|^2 * dΦ,\n\nwhere m is the mass of the initial fermion, |M|^2 is the squared matrix element representing the probability amplitude of the decay process, and dΦ is the differential phase space factor.\n\nThe matrix element |M|^2 is related to the coupling constant (g) of the interaction. In general, |M|^2 is proportional to the square of the coupling constant, i.e., |M|^2 ∝ g^2. A larger coupling constant implies a stronger interaction and a higher decay rate.\n\nThe available phase space is represented by the differential phase space factor (dΦ). It takes into account the kinematic constraints of the decay process, such as energy and momentum conservation. The phase space factor depends on the masses of the initial and final fermions and the energy available for the decay.\n\nIn summary, the decay rate of a fermion into two other fermions via the exchange of a virtual boson is determined by the coupling constant (which represents the strength of the interaction) and the available phase space (which represents the kinematic constraints of the decay process)."
