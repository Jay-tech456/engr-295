    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a massive elementary particle belonging to the lepton family, with a negative electric charge and a spin of 1/2. It is the heaviest of the three leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and has a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c². The tau lepton is unstable and decays via the weak force, with a mean lifetime of about 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds.\n\nThere are two main decay modes for the tau lepton: leptonic decay and hadronic decay.\n\n1. Leptonic decay: In this mode, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (either an electron or a muon) and two neutrinos (one tau neutrino and one electron or muon neutrino). The leptonic decay modes are:\n\n   τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅_τ (electron decay mode)\n   τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̅_τ (muon decay mode)\n\nThese decays conserve lepton flavor, electric charge, and other quantum numbers.\n\n2. Hadronic decay: In this mode, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles composed of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes can be further classified into one-prong and three-prong decays, depending on the number of charged particles in the final state:\n\n   One-prong decays: τ⁻ → h⁻ + ν_τ (h⁻ can be a charged pion or kaon)\n   Three-prong decays: τ⁻ → h⁻ + h⁺ + h⁻ + ν_τ (h⁻ and h⁺ can be charged pions or kaons)\n\nThe hadronic decays proceed through the intermediate production of a W⁻ boson, which subsequently decays into quarks that form the final state hadrons.\n\nThe differences between the decay modes lie in the final state particles and the decay channels. Leptonic decays involve only leptons in the final state, while hadronic decays involve hadrons. The branching ratios for these decay modes are approximately 35% for leptonic decays and 65% for hadronic decays.\n\nThe decay modes of the tau lepton provide information about its properties, such as its mass, lifetime, and couplings to other particles. By studying the decay rates and branching ratios, we can test the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics and probe for potential new physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, the tau lepton's decays can be used to study the properties of the weak force and the W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak interactions."
