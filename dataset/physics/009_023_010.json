Using Malus' Law, calculate the intensity of light that passes through two polarizers that are oriented at an angle of 60 degrees with respect to each other, if the intensity of unpolarized light entering the first polarizer is 10 W/m².",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through two polarizers is given by the equation:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of light after passing through the polarizers, I₀ is the initial intensity of light, and θ is the angle between the polarizers.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the intensity of light after passing through the first polarizer. Since the light entering the first polarizer is unpolarized, only half of the intensity will pass through. So, the intensity after the first polarizer is:\n\nI₁ = 0.5 * I₀ = 0.5 * 10 W/m² = 5 W/m²\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to calculate the intensity of light after passing through the second polarizer, which is oriented at an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the first one:\n\nI = I₁ * cos²(60°) = 5 W/m² * cos²(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 0.5, we have:\n\nI = 5 W/m² * (0.5)² = 5 W/m² * 0.25 = 1.25 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of light that passes through the two polarizers is 1.25 W/m²."
