    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, ΔHf is the standard enthalpy of formation, and n is the stoichiometric coefficient of each species in the balanced chemical equation.\n\nFor the products:\n\n1 mol CO2: ΔHf(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\n2 mol H2O: ΔHf(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants:\n\n1 mol CH4: ΔHf(CH4) = -74.84 kJ/mol\n2 mol O2: ΔHf(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH = [(1 × -393.5) + (2 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -74.84) + (2 × 0)]\nΔH = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.84)\nΔH = -965.1 + 74.84\nΔH = -890.26 kJ/mol\n\nSince we have 4.00 moles of methane reacting, we can multiply the enthalpy change per mole by the number of moles:\n\nΔH_total = -890.26 kJ/mol × 4.00 mol\nΔH_total = -3561.04 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction of 4.00 moles of methane with excess oxygen is -3561.04 kJ."
