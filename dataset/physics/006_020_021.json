    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom, we need to consider the following formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z * e^2 / (8 * π * ε₀ * E_inc))^2 * (1 / (1 - cos(θ)))^2 * (1 + cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere:\nσ(θ) is the Mott scattering cross section at angle θ\nZ is the atomic number of the target atom (helium in this case)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/Nm²)\nE_inc is the incident energy of the beta particle (1 MeV)\nθ is the scattering angle (60 degrees)\n\nFirst, let's convert the incident energy from MeV to Joules:\n\n1 MeV = 1 x 10^6 eV = 1 x 10^6 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J = 1.602 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow, let's calculate the Mott scattering cross section:\n\nZ = 2 (for helium)\nθ = 60 degrees = π/3 radians (conversion to radians)\n\nσ(θ) = (2 * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (8 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/Nm²) * (1.602 x 10^-13 J)))^2 * (1 / (1 - cos(π/3)))^2 * (1 + cos^2(π/3))\n\nσ(θ) = (2 * (2.566 x 10^-38 C²) / (8 * π * (7.112 x 10^-25 Nm²)))^2 * (1 / (1 - 0.5))^2 * (1 + 0.25)\n\nσ(θ) = (5.132 x 10^-38 C² / (7.112 x 10^-25 Nm²))^2 * 4 * 1.25\n\nσ(θ) = (7.208 x 10^-14)^2 * 5\n\nσ(θ) = 2.597 x 10^-26 m²\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom at an incident energy of 1 MeV and a scattering angle of 60 degrees is approximately 2.597 x 10^-26 m²."
