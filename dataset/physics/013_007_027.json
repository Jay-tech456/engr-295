    "message_2": "The velocity dispersion in the Milky Way's Galactic Disc refers to the distribution of velocities of stars and other celestial objects within the disc. It is an important parameter to study the dynamics and evolution of the galaxy. The velocity dispersion generally increases with distance from the Galactic Center, but the relationship is not linear. \n\nIn the Milky Way, there are two main components of stellar motion: radial (towards or away from the Galactic Center) and azimuthal (along the circular orbit around the Galactic Center). The velocity dispersion is typically higher for the radial component than for the azimuthal component. This is because stars in the disc are primarily influenced by the gravitational pull of the Galactic Center, causing them to move in elliptical orbits.\n\nThe presence of spiral arms in the Milky Way also affects the velocity dispersion. Spiral arms are regions of higher density in the Galactic Disc, where stars, gas, and dust are more concentrated. They are thought to be formed by density waves that propagate through the disc, causing the material to compress and form the spiral pattern.\n\nThe relationship between velocity dispersion and the presence of spiral arms can be explained as follows:\n\n1. As stars approach a spiral arm, they experience an increase in gravitational force due to the higher density of matter in the arm. This causes the stars to accelerate towards the arm, increasing their radial velocities.\n\n2. Once the stars pass through the spiral arm, they experience a decrease in gravitational force as the density of matter decreases. This causes the stars to decelerate, reducing their radial velocities.\n\n3. The net effect of this acceleration and deceleration is an increase in the velocity dispersion of stars in the vicinity of the spiral arms.\n\n4. Additionally, the spiral arms can induce non-circular motions in the stars, further increasing the velocity dispersion.\n\nIn summary, the velocity dispersion in the Milky Way's Galactic Disc generally increases with distance from the Galactic Center, and the presence of spiral arms further enhances this effect. The increased velocity dispersion near spiral arms is due to the gravitational influence of the higher density of matter in these regions, which causes stars to experience changes in their radial velocities as they move through the arms."
