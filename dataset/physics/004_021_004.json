    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon surrounding a black hole, and it can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object (in this case, 3 solar masses), and c is the speed of light (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, 3 solar masses would be:\n\nM = 3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs = 2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11) * (5.967 x 10^30) / (8.98755179 x 10^16)\n\nRs â‰ˆ 8.865 x 10^3 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a star with a mass of 3 solar masses that has undergone gravitational collapse is approximately 8,865 meters."
