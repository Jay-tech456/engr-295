    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from various sources both within and outside our galaxy. The most likely sources of cosmic rays can be classified into two categories: galactic and extragalactic.\n\n1. Galactic sources:\nThese are the sources within our Milky Way galaxy and are responsible for producing low to moderately high-energy cosmic rays. The main galactic sources include:\n\na. Supernova remnants (SNRs): SNRs are the remnants of massive stars that have exploded in supernovae. These explosions release a tremendous amount of energy, which accelerates charged particles to high energies. SNRs are considered the primary source of galactic cosmic rays up to the \"knee\" of the cosmic ray energy spectrum (around 10^15 eV).\n\nb. Pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. The interaction between the pulsar's magnetic field and the surrounding medium can create a pulsar wind nebula, which can also accelerate particles to high energies.\n\nc. Binary systems with massive stars and compact objects: In these systems, a massive star interacts with a compact object such as a neutron star or a black hole. The intense gravitational and magnetic fields in these systems can accelerate particles to high energies.\n\n2. Extragalactic sources:\nThese sources are located outside our galaxy and are responsible for producing the highest energy cosmic rays. The main extragalactic sources include:\n\na. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): AGNs are the central regions of galaxies that emit enormous amounts of energy, powered by supermassive black holes. The strong magnetic fields and shock waves in AGNs can accelerate particles to ultra-high energies, beyond the \"ankle\" of the cosmic ray energy spectrum (around 10^18 eV).\n\nb. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): GRBs are extremely energetic explosions, thought to be associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects. These events release a large amount of energy in the form of gamma rays, which can accelerate particles to ultra-high energies.\n\nc. Clusters of galaxies: Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, containing hundreds or thousands of galaxies. The interaction between the galaxies and the intracluster medium can produce shock waves and turbulence, which can accelerate particles to high energies.\n\nAs the energy of cosmic rays increases, their properties also change:\n\n1. Composition: At lower energies, cosmic rays are predominantly composed of protons and helium nuclei. As the energy increases, heavier nuclei become more abundant. At the highest energies, the composition is still uncertain and could include exotic particles or new forms of matter.\n\n2. Propagation: Lower-energy cosmic rays are more affected by the magnetic fields in the galaxy and the intergalactic medium, causing them to scatter and change direction. Higher-energy cosmic rays are less affected by these magnetic fields and travel in more straight paths, making it easier to trace them back to their sources.\n\n3. Interaction with the environment: Higher-energy cosmic rays have a higher probability of interacting with the cosmic microwave background radiation, producing secondary particles such as pions and neutrinos. This interaction leads to the so-called \"GZK cutoff\" at around 10^19.5 eV, where the flux of cosmic rays is expected to decrease significantly due to energy loss during these interactions."
