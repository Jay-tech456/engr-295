    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a velocity of 0.8c to its destination, which is located 10 light-years away from Earth. How much time would a clock onboard the spaceship show have passed at the moment of arrival, compared to the same clock on Earth? Assume time dilation occurs in accordance with special relativity.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time experienced by the passengers on the spaceship, we need to consider time dilation due to special relativity. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the time experienced by the passengers on the spaceship (proper time), t is the time experienced by an observer on Earth (coordinate time), v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for the spaceship to travel 10 light-years at a velocity of 0.8c as observed from Earth. \n\nt = distance / velocity\nt = 10 light-years / 0.8c\nt = 10 / 0.8 years\nt = 12.5 years\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula to find the time experienced by the passengers on the spaceship:\n\nt' = 12.5 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nt' = 12.5 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nt' = 12.5 / sqrt(0.36)\nt' = 12.5 / 0.6\nt' â‰ˆ 20.83 years\n\nSo, the clock onboard the spaceship would show approximately 20.83 years have passed at the moment of arrival, compared to the same clock on Earth showing 12.5 years."
