    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole affects the path of light passing nearby it due to a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing occurs because of the curvature of spacetime caused by the massive object, such as a black hole, according to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nWhen light from a distant object, like a star or galaxy, passes close to a massive object like a black hole, the gravitational field of the black hole bends the path of the light. This bending causes the light to follow a curved trajectory around the black hole, which can result in multiple images or distorted images of the distant object being observed by an observer on Earth.\n\nGravitational lensing can be used to identify the presence of a black hole in several ways:\n\n1. Multiple images: If a black hole is present between a distant light source and an observer, it can cause the light to be bent in such a way that multiple images of the same object are formed. These multiple images can be a strong indication of a massive object like a black hole causing the lensing effect.\n\n2. Distorted images: The presence of a black hole can cause the images of distant objects to be distorted or stretched. This stretching can be observed as an arc or a ring-like structure around the black hole, known as an \"Einstein ring.\" The detection of such distorted images can be a sign of a black hole causing the gravitational lensing.\n\n3. Magnification: Gravitational lensing can also cause the light from a distant object to be magnified, making it appear brighter than it would be without the lensing effect. This magnification can be used to detect the presence of a black hole, as the increased brightness of the object can be attributed to the lensing effect of the massive object.\n\n4. Microlensing: In some cases, a black hole can cause a temporary increase in the brightness of a distant star as it passes in front of the star from our perspective. This is known as microlensing, and it can be used to detect the presence of a black hole or other massive objects that are otherwise invisible.\n\nBy observing these effects and analyzing the patterns of light distortion, scientists can infer the presence of a black hole and even estimate its mass and distance. Gravitational lensing has become an essential tool in modern astrophysics, allowing researchers to study black holes and other massive objects that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect directly."
