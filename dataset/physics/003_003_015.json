    "message_1": "A toroid has a mean radius of 8 cm and 200 turns of wire. If a current of 2 A flows through the toroid, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid that is 5 cm from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * r²) / (2 * (r² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, r is the mean radius of the toroid, and x is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point on the axis.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nI = 2 A\nN = 200 turns\nr = 8 cm = 0.08 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 200 * (0.08 m)²) / (2 * ((0.08 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 200 * 0.0064) / (2 * (0.0064 + 0.0025)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (5.0265 × 10^(-5) T) / (2 * (0.0089)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (5.0265 × 10^(-5) T) / (2 * 0.0266)\n\nB ≈ 9.45 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid that is 5 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 9.45 × 10^(-5) T or 94.5 μT."
