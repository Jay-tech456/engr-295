    "message_2": "To find the energy of the fourth excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the energy level formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is the energy level (n = 0 for the ground state, n = 1 for the first excited state, and so on), hbar is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency, omega. We can do this using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/mu)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (5 N/m) and mu is the reduced mass (2 kg).\n\nomega = sqrt(5 N/m / 2 kg) = sqrt(2.5 s^-2) = 1.58113883 s^-1\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the fourth excited state (n = 4):\n\nE_4 = (4 + 1/2) * hbar * omega\nE_4 = (4.5) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) * (1.58113883 s^-1)\n\nE_4 = 7.536 × 10^-34 J\n\nThe energy of the fourth excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 7.536 × 10^-34 Joules."
