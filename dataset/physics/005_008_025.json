    "message_2": "To calculate the time elapsed on Earth's clock, we will use the time dilation formula derived from the Lorentz transformation. The formula is:\n\nΔt = Δt' / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time elapsed on Earth's clock, Δt' is the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock (10 years), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.9c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value inside the square root:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19\n\nNow, we can calculate the square root:\n\n√(0.19) ≈ 0.43589\n\nFinally, we can find the time elapsed on Earth's clock:\n\nΔt = Δt' / √(1 - v^2/c^2) = 10 years / 0.43589 ≈ 22.94 years\n\nSo, approximately 22.94 years have passed on Earth's clock since the spaceship launched."
