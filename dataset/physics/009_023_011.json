    "message_2": "To find the amount of light transmitted through the two polarizers, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle between the two polarizers:\n\nθ = |60° - 30°| = 30°\n\nSince the incident light is unpolarized, we need to take into account that only half of the intensity will pass through the first polarizer. Therefore, the intensity after passing through polarizer 1 is:\n\nI₁ = 100 mW/cm² * 0.5 = 50 mW/cm²\n\nNow, we can apply Malus' Law to find the transmitted intensity through both polarizers:\n\nI = I₁ * cos²(30°)\nI = 50 mW/cm² * (cos(30°))^2\nI = 50 mW/cm² * (0.866)^2\nI ≈ 37.5 mW/cm²\n\nSo, the amount of light transmitted through both polarizers is approximately 37.5 mW/cm²."
