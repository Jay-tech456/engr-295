    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor, we will use the formula for the magnetic field around a long straight wire carrying current:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (5 A), and r is the distance from the center of the inductor (10 cm = 0.1 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor is 1 μT (microtesla)."
