    "message_2": "Calculating non-perturbative effects in quantum field theory (QFT) can be challenging, especially when perturbative methods are not applicable. However, there are several approaches that can be employed to study non-perturbative phenomena in QFT. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Lattice field theory: This approach involves discretizing spacetime on a lattice and then performing numerical simulations to compute non-perturbative quantities. Lattice QCD, for example, is a widely used method for studying the non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions.\n\n2. AdS/CFT correspondence: Also known as the holographic principle or gauge/gravity duality, this method relates a strongly coupled gauge theory to a weakly coupled gravity theory in a higher-dimensional spacetime (Anti-de Sitter space). This correspondence allows for the calculation of non-perturbative effects in the gauge theory by studying the dual gravity theory.\n\n3. Effective field theories: In this approach, one constructs a low-energy effective theory that captures the relevant non-perturbative physics of the original theory. This can be done by integrating out high-energy degrees of freedom and retaining only the low-energy modes that contribute to the non-perturbative effects.\n\n4. Resummation techniques: These methods involve resumming certain classes of diagrams or contributions that are not captured by standard perturbation theory. Examples include the Borel resummation, which deals with the summation of factorially divergent series, and the renormalization group, which can be used to resum large logarithmic contributions.\n\n5. Solitons and instantons: These are classical solutions of the field equations that exhibit non-perturbative behavior. Studying the properties of solitons and instantons can provide insights into the non-perturbative aspects of QFT.\n\n6. Dualities and strong-weak coupling relations: Some theories exhibit dualities that relate strong coupling regimes to weak coupling regimes in a different theory or in the same theory with different parameters. By understanding these dualities, one can gain insights into the non-perturbative behavior of the original theory.\n\nEach of these methods has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific problem being studied. In many cases, a combination of these approaches may be necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the non-perturbative aspects of a given quantum field theory."
