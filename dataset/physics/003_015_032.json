    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the loop in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is square and symmetric, we can consider one-quarter of the loop and multiply the result by 4. Let's consider the quarter loop in the first quadrant of the xy-plane. We can integrate the Biot-Savart law over the length of the quarter loop to find the magnetic field due to this section.\n\nLet's first consider the vertical segment of the quarter loop (from (5,0) to (5,10) cm). The position vector r for a point on this segment is given by:\n\nr = xi + (y - 5)j\n\nwhere x = 5 cm, y varies from 0 to 10 cm, and i and j are the unit vectors in the x and y directions, respectively.\n\nThe current element dl is in the positive y direction, so:\n\ndl = dyj\n\nThe cross product dl x r is then:\n\ndl x r = -5k\n\nThe magnetic field dB due to this segment is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * -5k) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over y from 0 to 10 cm, we get:\n\nB₁ = - (μ₀ / 4π) * 10 * ∫(1 / r³) dy from 0 to 10\n\nNow let's consider the horizontal segment of the quarter loop (from (0,5) to (10,5) cm). The position vector r for a point on this segment is given by:\n\nr = (x - 5)i + 5j\n\nThe current element dl is in the positive x direction, so:\n\ndl = dxi\n\nThe cross product dl x r is then:\n\ndl x r = 5k\n\nThe magnetic field dB due to this segment is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * 5k) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over x from 0 to 10 cm, we get:\n\nB₂ = (μ₀ / 4π) * 10 * ∫(1 / r³) dx from 0 to 10\n\nSince the loop is symmetric, the magnetic field at the point due to the other two segments of the quarter loop will be the same as B₁ and B₂. Therefore, the total magnetic field B at the point is:\n\nB = 4(B₁ + B₂)\n\nB = 4(-B₁)\n\nB = -4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * 10 * ∫(1 / r³) dy from 0 to 10\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can use the fact that the point is 5 cm away from the center of the loop in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the loop. This means that r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 25). Therefore, r³ = (x^2 + y^2 + 25)^(3/2).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nB = -4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * 10 * ∫(1 / (x^2 + y^2 + 25)^(3/2)) dy from 0 to 10\n\nThis integral is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the value. Using a numerical integration tool, we find that the integral is approximately 0.0016.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field B at the point is:\n\nB = -4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * 10 * 0.0016\n\nB = -4 * (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 * 0.0016\n\nB ≈ -8.04 × 10^(-8) T\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the magnetic field is in the negative z direction, which is into the plane of the loop. So, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point is approximately 8.04 × 10^(-8) T, and its direction is into the plane of the loop."
