    "message_2": "The estimated percentage of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27%. This is based on the measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe. The remaining composition of the universe is roughly 68% dark energy and 5% ordinary (baryonic) matter.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in our understanding of cosmology and the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nDark matter is believed to be the \"glue\" that holds galaxies together and provides the necessary gravitational force for their formation. Without dark matter, the observed motion of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe would not be consistent with our current understanding of gravity and the laws of physics.\n\nThe presence of dark matter also influences the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters. These structures form through the process of gravitational collapse, where dark matter acts as a seed for the accumulation of ordinary matter. As a result, the distribution of dark matter in the universe directly affects the distribution of galaxies and other large-scale structures.\n\nIn summary, the estimated 27% of dark matter in the universe plays a vital role in our understanding of cosmology and the evolution of large-scale structures. It provides the necessary gravitational force for the formation of galaxies and influences the distribution of these structures throughout the universe."
