    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Snell's Law and some geometry. Snell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle of refraction inside the prism (θ2). The refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1. The refractive index of the glass prism (n2) is given as 1.5. The angle of incidence (θ1) is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60) = 0.866025\n0.866025 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.866025 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) = 0.57735\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.57735)\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nNow, let's find the angle of incidence at the second interface (θ3). Since the apex angle of the prism is 45 degrees, we can use the following relationship:\n\nθ3 = 45 - θ2\nθ3 = 45 - 35.3\nθ3 ≈ 9.7 degrees\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law again to find the angle of refraction when the light exits the prism (θ4):\n\n1.5 * sin(9.7) = 1 * sin(θ4)\n\nsin(9.7) = 0.168216\n0.168216 * 1.5 = sin(θ4)\n\nsin(θ4) = 0.252324\n\nθ4 = arcsin(0.252324)\nθ4 ≈ 14.6 degrees\n\nFinally, we can calculate the angle of deviation (δ) using the following relationship:\n\nδ = (θ1 - θ2) + (θ4 - θ3)\n\nδ = (60 - 35.3) + (14.6 - 9.7)\nδ = 24.7 + 4.9\nδ ≈ 29.6 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction inside the prism is approximately 35.3 degrees, and the angle of deviation when the light exits the prism is approximately 29.6 degrees."
