    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments, each carrying the same current (I). We can then calculate the magnetic field produced by each segment at the center of the loop and sum them up to find the total magnetic field.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of this segment is equal to the side length of the square, which is 10 cm or 0.1 m. The distance from the center of the loop to the midpoint of the segment (r) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr = √((side_length/2)^2 + (side_length/2)^2)\nr = √((0.1/2)^2 + (0.1/2)^2)\nr = √(0.005^2 + 0.005^2)\nr = √(0.000025 + 0.000025)\nr = √(0.00005)\nr ≈ 0.00707 m\n\nNow we can use Ampere's Law to calculate the magnetic field produced by one segment at the center of the loop:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current (I) is given as 2 A. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nB_segment = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.00707 m)\nB_segment ≈ (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.00707 m)\n\nNow we can calculate the total magnetic field at the center of the loop by summing up the magnetic field produced by all four segments:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_segment\nB_total ≈ 4 * (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.00707 m)\nB_total ≈ (32π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.00707 m)\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\nB_total ≈ (32π × 10^(-7) T) / (0.00707)\nB_total ≈ 1.43 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the square wire loop is approximately 1.43 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
