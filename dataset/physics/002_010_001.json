    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of vaporization (L) of water at room temperature (25°C), we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat required to vaporize the water, m is the mass of the water, and L is the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nWe are given the mass of water (m) as 50 grams and the heat required to vaporize it (Q) as 2260 J/g. We can rearrange the formula to solve for L:\n\nL = Q / m\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nL = (2260 J/g) / (50 g)\n\nL = 45.2 J/g\n\nSo, the latent heat of vaporization of water at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 45.2 J/g."
