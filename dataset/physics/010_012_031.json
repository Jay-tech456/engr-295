    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer, we first need to find the Reynolds number (Re) for the flow around the sphere. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid flow. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRe = (ρ * V * D) / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, D is the diameter of the sphere, and μ is the fluid viscosity.\n\nWe are given the Reynolds number (Re = 100), the diameter of the sphere (D = 1 cm = 0.01 m), the flow velocity (V = 1 m/s), and the fluid viscosity (μ = 1 Pa.s). We can rearrange the formula to find the fluid density (ρ):\n\nρ = (Re * μ) / (V * D)\n\nρ = (100 * 1) / (1 * 0.01)\n\nρ = 10000 kg/m³\n\nNow that we have the fluid density, we can use the Blasius boundary layer thickness formula for a sphere, which is given by:\n\nδ = 0.37 * (x / Re_x)^(1/5)\n\nwhere δ is the boundary layer thickness, x is the distance from the front of the sphere, and Re_x is the local Reynolds number at distance x. Since we are interested in the boundary layer thickness at a point on the surface of the sphere, we can assume x = D/2 = 0.005 m. The local Reynolds number at distance x can be calculated as:\n\nRe_x = (ρ * V * x) / μ\n\nRe_x = (10000 * 1 * 0.005) / 1\n\nRe_x = 50\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Blasius formula:\n\nδ = 0.37 * (0.005 / 50)^(1/5)\n\nδ = 0.37 * (0.0001)^(1/5)\n\nδ = 0.37 * 0.5623\n\nδ ≈ 0.208 cm\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a point on the surface of the sphere when the Reynolds number is 100 is approximately 0.208 cm."
