    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two reservoirs at temperatures T1 (hot reservoir) and T2 (cold reservoir). It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T2 / T1)\n\nIn this case, T1 = 500 K and T2 = 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine is 0.4 or 40%."
