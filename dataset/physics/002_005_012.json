    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for the student to solve:\n\nA gas undergoes a reversible isothermal expansion at a temperature of 300 K, where its initial volume and pressure are 2.5 L and 5.0 atm, respectively. The expansion causes the volume to increase to 5.0 L. Determine the entropy change of the gas during this process.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the entropy change of an ideal gas during a reversible isothermal process:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature. Rearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nn = (5.0 atm * 2.5 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K)\n\nn ≈ 0.339 mol\n\nNow we can find the entropy change:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nΔS = 0.339 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * ln(5.0 L / 2.5 L)\n\nΔS ≈ 0.339 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * ln(2)\n\nΔS ≈ 2.816 J/K\n\nSo, the entropy change of the gas during this reversible isothermal expansion is approximately 2.816 J/K."
