    "message_2": "To determine the work done on the gas during this process, we can use the formula for work done at constant pressure:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant external pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nIn this case, the initial volume (V1) is 2 L, the final volume (V2) is 0.5 L, and the constant external pressure is 200 kPa.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V2 - V1\nΔV = 0.5 L - 2 L\nΔV = -1.5 L\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = - (200 kPa) * (-1.5 L)\n\nW = 300 kJ\n\nSo, the work done on the gas during this process is 300 kJ."
