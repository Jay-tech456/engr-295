    "message_2": "To determine the maximum force that can be applied to a single DNA strand before it breaks, we need to consider the mechanical properties of DNA, specifically its tensile strength.\n\nThe tensile strength of DNA is typically around 1 GPa (gigapascal) or 1 x 10^9 N/m^2 (newtons per square meter). However, to calculate the force, we also need to know the cross-sectional area of the DNA strand.\n\nA DNA strand has a diameter of about 2 nanometers (2 x 10^-9 meters). To find the cross-sectional area (A) of the DNA strand, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the DNA strand.\n\nA = π * (2 x 10^-9 / 2)^2\nA ≈ 3.14 * (1 x 10^-9)^2\nA ≈ 3.14 * 10^-18 m^2\n\nNow that we have the cross-sectional area, we can calculate the maximum force (F) that can be applied to the DNA strand before it breaks using the tensile strength (σ) and the cross-sectional area (A):\n\nF = σ * A\n\nF = (1 x 10^9 N/m^2) * (3.14 * 10^-18 m^2)\nF ≈ 3.14 * 10^-9 N\n\nSo, the maximum force that can be applied to a single DNA strand of length 10 micrometers before it breaks under mechanical stress is approximately 3.14 x 10^-9 N (nanonewtons)."
