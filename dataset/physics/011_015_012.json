    "message_2": "The application of an external magnetic field to a thin film made of a magnetic material can significantly affect its magnetic properties, such as coercive force and magnetic anisotropy. These changes can be explained by considering the film's crystal structure and magnetic domain orientation.\n\n1. Coercive force: Coercive force is the intensity of the external magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of a magnetic material to zero after it has reached saturation. When an external magnetic field is applied to a thin film, the magnetic domains within the film tend to align themselves along the direction of the applied field. This alignment reduces the overall energy of the system, making it easier for the magnetic domains to switch their orientation. As a result, the coercive force decreases with the application of an external magnetic field.\n\n2. Magnetic anisotropy: Magnetic anisotropy refers to the directional dependence of a magnetic material's properties, such as magnetization and coercivity. In a thin film, magnetic anisotropy can arise due to various factors, including the crystal structure, shape of the film, and strain induced by the substrate. When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic anisotropy of the film can be altered. This is because the applied field can cause the magnetic domains to reorient themselves, leading to a change in the preferred direction of magnetization. The extent of this change depends on the strength of the applied field and the initial anisotropy of the film.\n\nTo understand these changes in terms of the film's crystal structure and magnetic domain orientation, consider the following factors:\n\na. Crystal structure: The arrangement of atoms in a magnetic material can influence its magnetic properties. For example, in a material with a cubic crystal structure, the magnetic anisotropy may be low, as the magnetization can easily switch between different crystallographic axes. However, in a material with a hexagonal crystal structure, the magnetic anisotropy may be higher due to the preferential alignment of the magnetic moments along specific crystallographic directions. The application of an external magnetic field can cause the magnetic moments to reorient themselves, leading to changes in the coercive force and magnetic anisotropy.\n\nb. Magnetic domain orientation: In a magnetic material, the magnetization is typically divided into several magnetic domains, each with a specific orientation. The boundaries between these domains, known as domain walls, can move in response to an applied magnetic field. When an external magnetic field is applied, the domain walls can shift, causing the magnetic domains to reorient themselves and align with the applied field. This process can lead to changes in the coercive force and magnetic anisotropy of the thin film.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of an external magnetic field can significantly affect the magnetic properties of a thin film made of a magnetic material. These changes can be explained by considering the film's crystal structure and magnetic domain orientation, which determine the coercive force and magnetic anisotropy of the material."
