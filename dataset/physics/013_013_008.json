    "message_2": "The maximum mass a neutron star can sustain before collapsing into a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit is approximately 2-3 times the mass of the Sun (Mâ˜‰), or about 4 x 10^30 kg. However, the exact value depends on the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron star's matter, which is still not fully understood.\n\nThe mass limit of a neutron star depends on several properties, including its radius and rotation rate:\n\n1. Radius: The radius of a neutron star is related to its mass and the EOS of its matter. A larger radius generally corresponds to a larger mass limit, as the star can support more mass before collapsing. However, the relationship between mass and radius is not linear, and the exact dependence is determined by the EOS.\n\n2. Rotation rate: Rapidly rotating neutron stars, known as millisecond pulsars, can support more mass than non-rotating or slowly rotating neutron stars. This is because the centrifugal force due to rotation counteracts the inward pull of gravity, allowing the star to maintain stability at higher masses. The maximum mass of a rapidly rotating neutron star can be up to 20% higher than the TOV limit for non-rotating neutron stars.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass a neutron star can sustain before collapsing into a black hole is approximately 2-3 solar masses, but the exact value depends on the properties of the neutron star, such as its radius and rotation rate, as well as the EOS of its matter."
