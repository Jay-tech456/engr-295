    "message_2": "The general strategy for calculating the low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of a system in quantum field theory involves integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom to obtain a simplified description of the system at low energies. This approach is particularly useful when studying physical systems where the high-energy details are not crucial for understanding the low-energy behavior. The effective field theory provides a systematic way to organize the calculations and allows for a controlled approximation of the system's behavior.\n\nHere are the main steps to calculate the low-energy EFT for a given system:\n\n1. Identify the relevant energy scales: Determine the energy scale of interest (low-energy regime) and the energy scale at which new physics or high-energy degrees of freedom become important.\n\n2. Separate the degrees of freedom: Divide the fields in the theory into low-energy and high-energy degrees of freedom. The low-energy degrees of freedom are the ones that are relevant for the EFT, while the high-energy degrees of freedom will be integrated out.\n\n3. Integrate out high-energy degrees of freedom: Perform a path integral over the high-energy degrees of freedom, which will result in an effective action that depends only on the low-energy fields. This step typically involves perturbative calculations, where the high-energy fields are treated as small perturbations around the low-energy background.\n\n4. Organize the effective action in terms of an expansion: The resulting effective action can be organized as a series of terms, each with a specific power of the energy scale ratio (low-energy scale divided by the high-energy scale). The leading terms in this expansion are the most important for describing the low-energy physics, while the higher-order terms represent corrections that become less important as the energy scale decreases.\n\n5. Match the coefficients: To obtain the EFT for a specific physical system, match the coefficients of the terms in the effective action to the corresponding terms in the full theory. This can be done by comparing the predictions of the EFT and the full theory for specific processes or observables, and adjusting the coefficients to minimize the difference between the two.\n\nOnce the low-energy EFT is obtained, it can be used to study the properties of the physical system at the relevant energy scale, with a controlled approximation that takes into account the effects of the high-energy degrees of freedom. This approach is widely used in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics, to study systems where the separation of energy scales allows for a simplification of the problem."
