    "message_2": "To calculate the Hawking radiation emitted by a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M, we will use the framework of quantum field theory. We will consider a massless, minimally coupled scalar field outside the event horizon. The temperature of the black hole's event horizon is given by:\n\nT_H = (ħ c³) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe power emitted by the black hole due to Hawking radiation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power emitted per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature:\n\nP/A = σ T_H^4\n\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe area of the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is given by:\n\nA = 4πR_s^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which can be calculated as:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c²\n\nNow, we can calculate the total power emitted by the black hole due to Hawking radiation:\n\nP = (P/A) * A = σ T_H^4 * 4πR_s^2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for T_H and R_s, we get:\n\nP = σ ((ħ c³) / (8πGMk_B))^4 * 4π(2GM/c²)^2\n\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain:\n\nP = (ħ c^6) / (15360 π G^2 M^2 k_B^4)\n\nThis is the power emitted by a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M due to Hawking radiation in the framework of quantum field theory, considering a massless, minimally coupled scalar field outside the event horizon."
