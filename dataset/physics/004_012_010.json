    "message_2": "To calculate the age of the universe using the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, we need to consider the Hubble parameter (H0) and its relation to the age of the universe. The Hubble parameter is given as 70 km/s/Mpc.\n\nFirst, let's convert the Hubble parameter to SI units. 1 Mpc (megaparsec) is equal to 3.086 × 10^19 km. So,\n\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 km)\nH0 ≈ 2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can use the Hubble time (tH) formula to estimate the age of the universe. The Hubble time is the inverse of the Hubble parameter:\n\ntH = 1 / H0\n\ntH ≈ 1 / (2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1)\ntH ≈ 4.407 × 10^17 s\n\nNow, let's convert the Hubble time to years:\n\n1 year ≈ 3.154 × 10^7 s\n\ntH ≈ (4.407 × 10^17 s) / (3.154 × 10^7 s/year)\ntH ≈ 13.97 billion years\n\nSo, using the FLRW metric and the given Hubble parameter, the estimated age of the universe is approximately 13.97 billion years. Keep in mind that this is a simplified calculation, and the actual age of the universe might be slightly different due to various factors and assumptions in cosmological models."
