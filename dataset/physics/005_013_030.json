    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle before the collision, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven the rest mass m = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg and the velocity v = 0.8c, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(0.36)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / 0.6\n\nE = (1.503 x 10^-10 kg * m^2/s^2)\n\nSo, the energy of the particle before the collision is approximately 1.503 x 10^-10 Joules."
