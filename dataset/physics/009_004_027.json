    "message_1": "What is the critical angle of a glass-to-air boundary if the refractive index of the glass is 1.5 and the incident medium is air? If a ray of light enters the glass at an angle of 30 degrees with the normal, will it be reflected or refracted at the boundary?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of the glass (1.5), and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1). The critical angle occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1/1.5\nθ1 = arcsin(1/1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81°\n\nThe critical angle is approximately 41.81 degrees.\n\nNow, let's determine if the ray of light entering the glass at an angle of 30 degrees with the normal will be reflected or refracted at the boundary. Since the angle of incidence (30 degrees) is less than the critical angle (41.81 degrees), the light will be refracted at the boundary, not reflected."
