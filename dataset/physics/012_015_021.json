    "message_2": "To optimize the plasma-based food processing technique for effective and efficient reduction of harmful microorganisms while preserving nutritional value and sensory properties, we can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Optimize plasma generation parameters: Adjust the plasma generation parameters such as voltage, frequency, and power to achieve the desired microbial inactivation without causing significant damage to the food matrix. This may require a systematic study to determine the optimal conditions for different food products.\n\n2. Pulsed plasma treatment: Use pulsed plasma treatment instead of continuous plasma exposure. This allows for better control over the treatment duration and intensity, reducing the risk of overheating or over-processing the food product.\n\n3. Combination with other preservation techniques: Combine plasma treatment with other non-thermal food preservation techniques, such as high-pressure processing, ultraviolet light, or natural antimicrobial agents. This can enhance the overall effectiveness of microbial inactivation while minimizing the impact on food quality.\n\n4. Controlled atmosphere: Perform plasma treatment under a controlled atmosphere, such as modified air packaging or vacuum packaging, to minimize the exposure of food products to oxygen and other reactive species that may cause oxidation and deterioration of food quality.\n\n5. Optimize plasma gas composition: Use a suitable gas mixture for plasma generation, such as a combination of noble gases and reactive gases like oxygen or nitrogen. This can help to enhance the antimicrobial effect of plasma while minimizing the impact on food quality.\n\n6. Pre-treatment and post-treatment strategies: Implement pre-treatment strategies, such as washing or blanching, to remove surface contaminants and reduce the microbial load before plasma treatment. Post-treatment strategies, such as the application of protective coatings or packaging, can help to maintain the quality and safety of food products after plasma treatment.\n\n7. Monitoring and control systems: Develop real-time monitoring and control systems to ensure that plasma treatment is applied consistently and effectively across different food products and batches. This can help to maintain a high level of food safety and quality.\n\n8. Tailored treatment for specific food products: Develop customized plasma treatment protocols for different food products, taking into account their unique properties, such as moisture content, pH, and texture. This can help to maximize the effectiveness of plasma treatment while minimizing any negative impacts on food quality.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, it is possible to optimize plasma-based food processing techniques for the effective and efficient reduction of harmful microorganisms while preserving the nutritional value and sensory properties of food products."
