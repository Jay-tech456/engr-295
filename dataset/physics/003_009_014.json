    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point on the surface of a sphere carrying a steady current, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's find the total current enclosed by the loop. In this case, the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere, and the total current is 3 A.\n\nNow, let's consider a circular loop of radius r on the surface of the sphere. The magnetic field (B) will be tangential to the loop at every point, and its magnitude will be the same at all points on the loop due to the symmetry of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the closed line integral of the magnetic field around the loop can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B∮dl\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = B(2πr)\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's Law:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nWe want to find the magnetic field at a point on the surface of the sphere, so we'll use the radius of the sphere (r = 5 cm = 0.05 m) and the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A):\n\nB(2π × 0.05) = (4π × 10⁻⁷)(3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ × 3) / (2π × 0.05)\n\nB ≈ (12π × 10⁻⁷) / 0.1π\n\nB ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the surface of the sphere carrying a steady current of 3 A is approximately 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ T (tesla)."
