    "message_2": "The formation of the Solar System's terrestrial planets, also known as rocky planets, involves a process called accretion, which took place around 4.6 billion years ago. This process can be divided into several stages:\n\n1. Nebular collapse: The Solar System began as a large cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Due to gravitational forces, the nebula started to collapse, causing it to heat up and rotate faster.\n\n2. Formation of the protostar and protoplanetary disk: As the nebula continued to collapse, the material at the center formed a protostar (which later became the Sun), while the remaining material flattened into a rotating protoplanetary disk.\n\n3. Condensation and solidification: In the protoplanetary disk, dust particles started to condense and solidify due to the cooling of the disk. These solid particles were composed of various elements and compounds, such as silicates and metals.\n\n4. Accretion of planetesimals: The solid particles in the disk began to collide and stick together due to electrostatic forces and gravity, eventually forming larger bodies called planetesimals. These planetesimals continued to grow in size as they collided with other particles and planetesimals.\n\n5. Formation of protoplanets: As the planetesimals grew larger, their gravitational pull increased, attracting more material and leading to the formation of protoplanets. The terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) formed in the inner part of the Solar System, where temperatures were high enough for the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, to be blown away by the solar wind, leaving behind the heavier elements that make up the rocky planets.\n\n6. Late-stage accretion and differentiation: The protoplanets continued to grow and evolve through collisions and accretion of material. During this stage, the heavier elements sank to the core of the protoplanets, while the lighter elements rose to the surface, leading to the differentiation of the planets' internal structure.\n\nThe dynamic behaviors of terrestrial planets differ from those of the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) in several ways:\n\n1. Composition: Terrestrial planets are primarily composed of heavier elements, such as iron, nickel, and silicates, while giant planets are mainly composed of lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, with small rocky cores.\n\n2. Size and mass: Terrestrial planets are smaller and less massive than giant planets. This results in weaker gravitational forces and lower escape velocities, which affects their ability to retain lighter elements and gases in their atmospheres.\n\n3. Atmosphere: Terrestrial planets have relatively thin atmospheres compared to the thick, gaseous envelopes surrounding the giant planets. This is due to their weaker gravitational pull and their proximity to the Sun, which causes lighter elements to be blown away by the solar wind.\n\n4. Magnetic fields: Terrestrial planets have weaker magnetic fields compared to the giant planets. This is because their cores are smaller and less active, resulting in weaker dynamo effects that generate magnetic fields.\n\n5. Orbital and rotational dynamics: Terrestrial planets have relatively shorter orbital periods and slower rotation rates compared to the giant planets. This is due to their closer proximity to the Sun and their smaller size and mass."
