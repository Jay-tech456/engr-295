    "message_2": "The human eye perceives and differentiates colors based on the physical properties of light, such as wavelength and frequency, through a process involving photoreceptor cells in the retina. These photoreceptor cells, called cones, are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths and are responsible for color vision. There are three types of cones: S-cones (short-wavelength), M-cones (medium-wavelength), and L-cones (long-wavelength), which are sensitive to blue, green, and red light, respectively.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the aqueous humor, the lens, and the vitreous humor before reaching the retina. The cones in the retina absorb the light and convert it into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals and interprets them as colors.\n\nThe spectral sensitivity of the human eye can be described by the following mathematical functions, which represent the relative sensitivity of each type of cone to different wavelengths of light:\n\n1. S-cones: S(λ) = S₀ * e^(-0.5 * ((λ - λS) / σS)^2)\n2. M-cones: M(λ) = M₀ * e^(-0.5 * ((λ - λM) / σM)^2)\n3. L-cones: L(λ) = L₀ * e^(-0.5 * ((λ - λL) / σL)^2)\n\nHere, λ represents the wavelength of light, and λS, λM, and λL are the peak sensitivity wavelengths for S-cones, M-cones, and L-cones, respectively. σS, σM, and σL are the standard deviations of the sensitivity curves for each cone type, and S₀, M₀, and L₀ are the maximum sensitivities.\n\nThe color discrimination of the human eye can be analyzed using the CIE 1931 color space, which is a mathematical representation of color perception. In this color space, colors are represented by three coordinates: X, Y, and Z. The CIE 1931 color matching functions, denoted as x(λ), y(λ), and z(λ), are used to convert the spectral power distribution of light into the X, Y, and Z coordinates.\n\nX = ∫[S(λ) * x(λ) * dλ]\nY = ∫[S(λ) * y(λ) * dλ]\nZ = ∫[S(λ) * z(λ) * dλ]\n\nHere, S(λ) represents the spectral power distribution of light, and the integrals are taken over the visible spectrum (approximately 380 nm to 780 nm).\n\nThe CIE 1931 color space can be further transformed into the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space, which provides a more uniform representation of color differences. This transformation involves calculating the L* (lightness), u* (green-red axis), and v* (blue-yellow axis) coordinates:\n\nL* = 116 * (Y/Y₀)^(1/3) - 16\nu* = 13 * L* * (u' - u₀')\nv* = 13 * L* * (v' - v₀')\n\nHere, Y₀ is the reference white point for the Y coordinate, and u₀' and v₀' are the reference white points for the u' and v' coordinates, which are calculated as follows:\n\nu' = 4 * X / (X + 15 * Y + 3 * Z)\nv' = 9 * Y / (X + 15 * Y + 3 * Z)\n\nColor discrimination can be quantified by calculating the color difference (ΔE) between two colors in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space:\n\nΔE = √((ΔL*)^2 + (Δu*)^2 + (Δv*)^2)\n\nA smaller ΔE value indicates that the two colors are more similar, while a larger ΔE value indicates that the colors are more distinct."
