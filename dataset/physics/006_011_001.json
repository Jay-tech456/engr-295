    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0 * h^2) / (m_e * e^2)\n\nwhere ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85418782 × 10^-12 C^2 / N·m^2), h is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg), and e is the electron charge (1.60217662 × 10^-19 C).\n\nHowever, we are given the Coulomb constant (k) instead of the vacuum permittivity (ε0). The relationship between the two is:\n\nk = 1 / (4πε0)\n\nSo, ε0 = 1 / (4πk)\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of ε0 into the formula for the Bohr radius:\n\na0 = (4π * (1 / (4πk)) * h^2) / (m_e * e^2)\n\na0 = (h^2) / (m_e * e^2 * k)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\na0 = ((1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js)^2) / ((9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg) * (1.60217662 × 10^-19 C)^2 * (8.987551 × 10^9 N·m^2·C^-2))\n\na0 ≈ 5.291772 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291772 × 10^-11 meters."
