    "message_1": "A physics student needs to find the focal length of a convex mirror whose radius of curvature is 20 cm. If an object is placed 10 cm away from the mirror, what will be the image distance and the size of the image formed?",
    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a convex mirror, we can use the formula:\n\nf = R/2\n\nwhere f is the focal length and R is the radius of curvature. In this case, R = 20 cm.\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow that we have the focal length, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. In this case, f = 10 cm and u = -10 cm (negative because the object is in front of the mirror).\n\n1/10 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\n1/10 + 1/10 = 1/v\n\n2/10 = 1/v\n\nv = 10/2 = 5 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 5 cm behind the mirror (positive because it's a virtual image).\n\nNow, to find the size of the image, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance. In this case, v = 5 cm and u = -10 cm.\n\nM = -5 / (-10) = 1/2\n\nThe magnification is 1/2, which means the size of the image is half the size of the object."
