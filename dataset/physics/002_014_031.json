    "message_2": "The efficiency of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the interior (Q_cold) to the work input (W). In this case, the refrigerator uses 1000 J of energy (work input) to remove 800 J of heat from the interior.\n\nEfficiency = Q_cold / W\n\nEfficiency = 800 J / 1000 J\n\nEfficiency = 0.8 or 80%\n\nThe efficiency of the refrigerator is 80%."
