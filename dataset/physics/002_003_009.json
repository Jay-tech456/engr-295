    "message_2": "To calculate the change in internal energy of the gas, we need to know the heat capacity of the gas. The heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the gas by 1 K. Since the volume and pressure remain constant, we can use the constant volume heat capacity (Cv) for this calculation.\n\nThe heat capacity depends on the type of gas and its molar mass. However, since we don't have information about the type of gas, we can use the general equation for the change in internal energy:\n\nΔU = n * Cv * ΔT\n\nwhere ΔU is the change in internal energy, n is the number of moles of gas, Cv is the constant volume heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 500 K - 300 K = 200 K\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles (n) and the heat capacity (Cv) of the gas. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine these values. However, we can express the change in internal energy in terms of these unknowns:\n\nΔU = n * Cv * 200 K\n\nWithout more information about the type of gas and its molar mass, we cannot provide a numerical value for the change in internal energy."
