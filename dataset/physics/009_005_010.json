    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. The focal length (f) of a concave mirror is half of the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 15 cm / 2 = 7.5 cm\n\nThe object distance (do) is given as 20 cm. Now we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/7.5 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(20 + 7.5*di) / (7.5*20) = 1/di\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\n20 + 7.5*di = 7.5*20*di\n\nNext, we can isolate di:\n\n7.5*di - 7.5*20*di = -20\n\ndi(7.5 - 7.5*20) = -20\n\ndi = -20 / (7.5 - 7.5*20)\n\ndi â‰ˆ 60 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is approximately 60 cm. Since the image distance is positive, the image is real. A real image formed by a concave mirror is always inverted. Therefore, the image is real and inverted."
