    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor has a plate area of 0.02 m² and a separation distance of 0.01 m between the plates. A current of 2 A flows through the capacitor. Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 0.05 m away from the center of the capacitor and perpendicular to the plane of the plates.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 0.05 m away from the center of the capacitor and perpendicular to the plane of the plates, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the plate area, we can use Ampere's law to simplify the calculation.\n\nAmpere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nWe can consider a rectangular loop with two sides parallel to the plates and two sides perpendicular to the plates. The length of the parallel sides is equal to the distance between the plates (0.01 m), and the length of the perpendicular sides is equal to the distance from the center of the capacitor to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field (0.05 m).\n\nThe magnetic field is constant along the parallel sides of the loop, so the line integral of the magnetic field along these sides is equal to B times the length of the sides (0.01 m). The magnetic field is zero along the perpendicular sides of the loop, so the line integral of the magnetic field along these sides is zero.\n\nTherefore, the total line integral of the magnetic field around the loop is:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B(0.01 m) + 0 = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (0.01 m)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A, and the current (I) is 2 A:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A × 2 A) / (0.01 m)\n\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 0.05 m away from the center of the capacitor and perpendicular to the plane of the plates is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
