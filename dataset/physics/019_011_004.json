    "message_2": "Deriving an effective field theory (EFT) from a parent quantum field theory (QFT) involves integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom, leaving only the low-energy degrees of freedom that are relevant for the phenomena of interest. This process is useful for making accurate predictions for the behavior of particles at low energies, as it allows us to focus on the relevant physics without being bogged down by the complexities of the full theory.\n\nHere is a general outline of the process for deriving an EFT from a parent QFT:\n\n1. Identify the energy scale of interest: Determine the energy scale (E) at which you want to make predictions. This scale should be much smaller than the energy scale associated with the high-energy degrees of freedom in the parent QFT.\n\n2. Separate the degrees of freedom: Divide the fields in the parent QFT into high-energy (heavy) and low-energy (light) degrees of freedom. The heavy degrees of freedom are those with masses or energy scales much larger than E, while the light degrees of freedom have masses or energy scales comparable to or smaller than E.\n\n3. Integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom: Perform a path integral over the heavy degrees of freedom, effectively averaging over their effects on the light degrees of freedom. This will result in an effective action that depends only on the light degrees of freedom.\n\n4. Organize the effective action in terms of a power series: Expand the effective action in a power series in the ratio of the low-energy scale E to the high-energy scale associated with the heavy degrees of freedom. This expansion is known as the derivative expansion or the Wilsonian expansion.\n\n5. Truncate the power series: Keep only the leading terms in the power series, which will give the most significant contributions to the low-energy physics. This will result in a simpler effective action that captures the essential features of the parent QFT at the energy scale E.\n\n6. Extract physical predictions: Use the truncated effective action to compute observables and make predictions for the behavior of particles at low energies. These predictions will be accurate up to corrections of order (E/Λ)^n, where Λ is the high-energy scale and n is the order of the truncation.\n\nThe resulting EFT can be used to make accurate predictions for the behavior of particles at low energies, as it captures the essential physics of the parent QFT without the complications of the high-energy degrees of freedom. This approach has been successfully applied in various areas of physics, such as the study of low-energy QCD (chiral perturbation theory), condensed matter systems, and effective theories for gravity."
