    "message_2": "To determine the trajectory of the particle, we need to consider the relativistic mass, the Lorentz force acting on the particle, and the radius of curvature of its trajectory.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the relativistic mass (m) of the particle using the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle (0.8c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, let's find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m₀ * γ\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass of the particle (1 microgram).\n\nm ≈ 1.6667 * 1 µg ≈ 1.6667 µg\n\nNext, we need to determine the Lorentz force (F) acting on the particle due to the magnetic field (B):\n\nF = q * v * B\nwhere q is the charge of the particle.\n\nSince we don't have information about the charge of the particle, we'll represent it as q.\n\nF = q * 0.8c * 2 T\n\nNow, let's find the radius of curvature (R) of the particle's trajectory using the centripetal force equation:\n\nF = m * a\nwhere a is the centripetal acceleration.\n\nFor a particle moving in a circle, the centripetal acceleration is given by:\n\na = v² / R\n\nSo, the centripetal force equation becomes:\n\nF = m * v² / R\n\nNow, let's solve for R:\n\nR = m * v² / F\n\nSubstitute the values of m, v, and F:\n\nR = (1.6667 µg) * (0.8c)² / (q * 0.8c * 2 T)\n\nR ≈ 1.0667 µg * c² / (2qT)\n\nThe trajectory of the particle will be a circle with a radius R in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The exact value of R depends on the charge of the particle (q)."
