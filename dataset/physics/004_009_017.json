How does it compare to the specific angular momentum of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole with the same mass?",
    "message_2": "The specific angular momentum of a Kerr black hole is given by the formula:\n\nh = a * G * M / c\n\nwhere h is the specific angular momentum, a is the spin parameter, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the mass M = 10 solar masses and a spin parameter a = 0.5, we can calculate the specific angular momentum:\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass to kilograms. 1 solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, 10 solar masses is:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nh = (0.5) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nh â‰ˆ 2.204 x 10^16 m^2/s\n\nSo, the specific angular momentum of the Kerr black hole is approximately 2.204 x 10^16 m^2/s.\n\nFor a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the spin parameter a = 0. Therefore, the specific angular momentum h = 0. \n\nComparing the specific angular momentum of the Kerr black hole to that of the Schwarzschild black hole, we can see that the Kerr black hole has a significantly higher specific angular momentum due to its rotation. The Schwarzschild black hole, being non-rotating, has no specific angular momentum."
