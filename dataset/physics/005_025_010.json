    "message_2": "First, let's find the relativistic energy of a stationary electron. Since the electron is stationary, its velocity (v) is 0. Therefore, the equation E = mc²/(√(1-(v/c)²)) simplifies to E = mc², as the term (v/c) becomes 0.\n\nGiven the rest mass (m) of the electron is 0.511 MeV/c², we can calculate its energy:\n\nE = mc²\nE = (0.511 MeV/c²)(c²)\nE = 0.511 MeV\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of a stationary electron is 0.511 MeV.\n\nNow, let's find the relativistic energy when the electron is traveling with a speed of 0.9c. We can use the given equation:\n\nE = mc²/(√(1-(v/c)²))\n\nHere, m = 0.511 MeV/c² and v = 0.9c. Plugging in the values:\n\nE = (0.511 MeV/c²)(c²)/(√(1-(0.9c/c)²))\nE = (0.511 MeV)/(√(1-0.81))\nE = (0.511 MeV)/(√(0.19))\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nE ≈ (0.511 MeV)/(0.4359)\nE ≈ 1.172 MeV\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the electron when it is traveling with a speed of 0.9c is approximately 1.172 MeV."
