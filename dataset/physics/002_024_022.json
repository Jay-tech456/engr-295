    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 50°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the given temperatures to Kelvin: T1 = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K and T2 = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n2. Convert the enthalpy of vaporization to J/mol: ΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 40700 J/mol\n3. Use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: ln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1), where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), P1 is the vapor pressure at T1 (1 atm), and P2 is the vapor pressure at T2 (unknown).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/1 atm) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nln(P2) = 9.208\n\nTo find P2, take the exponent of both sides:\n\nP2 = e^(9.208) = 10000.6 Pa\n\nSince 1 atm = 101325 Pa, we can convert P2 to atm:\n\nP2 = 10000.6 Pa * (1 atm / 101325 Pa) = 0.0987 atm\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 0.0987 atm."
