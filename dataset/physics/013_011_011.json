    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum angular resolution needed to detect an Earth-sized exoplanet, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which is given by the formula:\n\nθ = 1.22 * (λ / D)\n\nwhere θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the wavelength of light being observed, and D is the diameter of the telescope's mirror.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the size of the exoplanet in terms of its angular size as seen from Earth. The Earth-sized exoplanet has a diameter of approximately 12,742 km. The distance to the star is given as 10 parsecs, which is equivalent to 3.086 x 10^17 meters. \n\nAngular size (α) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = d / r\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the exoplanet and r is the distance to the star.\n\nα = (12,742 x 10^3 m) / (3.086 x 10^17 m)\nα ≈ 4.13 x 10^-11 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Rayleigh criterion to find the minimum angular resolution needed. We'll assume the telescope is observing in visible light, with a wavelength of 550 nm (5.5 x 10^-7 m). The diameter of the telescope's mirror is given as 4 meters.\n\nθ = 1.22 * (λ / D)\nθ = 1.22 * (5.5 x 10^-7 m / 4 m)\nθ ≈ 1.68 x 10^-7 radians\n\nSince the angular size of the exoplanet (4.13 x 10^-11 radians) is much smaller than the angular resolution of the telescope (1.68 x 10^-7 radians), it would be extremely difficult to directly detect the Earth-sized exoplanet using this telescope. To improve the chances of detection, a larger telescope or alternative methods such as transit photometry or radial velocity measurements should be considered."
