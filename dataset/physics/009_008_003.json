    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula. The mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = 20 cm\nObject distance (u) = -40 cm (negative sign because the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/(-40) + 1/v\n\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/40\n1/v = (2 + 1)/40\n1/v = 3/40\n\nv = 40/3 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 40/3 cm or approximately 13.33 cm. The positive sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(40/3)/(-40)\nM = 40/3 / 40\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object and is smaller than the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real, inverted, and smaller image located at a distance of 40/3 cm or approximately 13.33 cm from the mirror."
