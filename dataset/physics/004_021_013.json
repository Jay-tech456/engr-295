    "message_2": "According to the theories of General Relativity, a star will undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole if its mass is above a certain threshold known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is approximately 2-3 times the mass of our Sun, or roughly 2-3 solar masses (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\nHowever, the mass alone is not sufficient to determine if a star will form a black hole. The radius of the star also plays a crucial role. A star's fate depends on its density, which is the ratio of its mass to its volume. A star with a higher density is more likely to collapse into a black hole.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is a critical parameter in determining the formation of a black hole. It is the radius at which the escape velocity from the star's gravitational pull equals the speed of light. The Schwarzschild radius can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = (2GM) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFor a star to form a black hole, its actual radius must be equal to or smaller than its Schwarzschild radius. If a star with a mass of 2-3 solar masses has a radius smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, it will likely undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass required for a star to potentially form a black hole is around 2-3 solar masses. The actual radius of the star must also be equal to or smaller than its Schwarzschild radius for the collapse to result in a black hole."
