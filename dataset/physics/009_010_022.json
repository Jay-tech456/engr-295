    "message_1": "A concave lens has a focal length of 10 cm. If an object is placed 30 cm in front of the lens, what is the magnification produced by the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification produced by the lens, we first need to determine the image distance (v) using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. In this case, f = -10 cm (concave lens has a negative focal length) and u = -30 cm (object distance is negative according to the sign convention).\n\n1/(-10) = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-10) - 1/(-30)\n1/v = (-2 + 1)/30\n1/v = -1/30\n\nv = -30 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-30)/(-30)\n\nM = 1\n\nThe magnification produced by the lens is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object."
