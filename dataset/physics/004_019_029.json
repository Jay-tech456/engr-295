    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational time dilation effect experienced by the spacecraft, we need to consider both the gravitational time dilation due to the planet's mass and the time dilation due to the spacecraft's velocity (special relativity).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the gravitational time dilation. The formula for gravitational time dilation is:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (R * c^2))\n\nwhere t' is the dilated time, t is the proper time, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the planet, R is the distance from the center of the planet to the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven the radius of the planet (6,371 km), we need to find the altitude of the spacecraft's orbit. Since the spacecraft is moving at 0.9c, it must be in a very high orbit. For simplicity, let's assume the spacecraft is in a circular orbit at an altitude of 300 km above the planet's surface. This gives us a total distance R of 6,671 km (6,371 km + 300 km) or 6.671 x 10^6 meters.\n\nNow we can calculate the gravitational time dilation:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.98 x 10^24 kg) / (6.671 x 10^6 m * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\n\nt' ≈ t * sqrt(1 - 0.00944)\nt' ≈ t * sqrt(0.99056)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time dilation due to the spacecraft's velocity using special relativity. The formula for time dilation due to velocity is:\n\nt'' = t' * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere t'' is the total dilated time, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light.\n\nt'' = t * sqrt(0.99056) * sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2)\nt'' = t * sqrt(0.99056) * sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nt'' = t * sqrt(0.99056) * sqrt(0.19)\n\nNow we can find the total time dilation effect experienced by the spacecraft:\n\nt'' = t * sqrt(0.99056 * 0.19)\nt'' ≈ t * sqrt(0.1882)\n\nSo, the gravitational time dilation effect experienced by the spacecraft is approximately t * sqrt(0.1882). This means that for every second of proper time (t) experienced by the spacecraft, it experiences approximately 0.434 seconds of dilated time (t'') relative to the planet's surface."
