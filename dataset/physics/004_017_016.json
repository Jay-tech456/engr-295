    "message_2": "In the framework of General Relativity, the deflection angle (α) of a light ray passing close to a massive object can be predicted using the gravitational lensing equation. The equation for the deflection angle is given by:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the massive object, c is the speed of light, and b is the distance of closest approach (also known as the impact parameter).\n\nNow, let's consider how the deflection angle would change if the mass (M) or distance (b) were modified.\n\n1. If the mass (M) of the massive object increases, the deflection angle (α) will also increase. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the massive object on the light ray will be stronger, causing a greater bending of the light ray. Mathematically, since M is in the numerator of the equation, an increase in M will result in an increase in α.\n\n2. If the distance (b) of closest approach increases, the deflection angle (α) will decrease. This is because the light ray will be farther away from the massive object, and the gravitational force exerted on the light ray will be weaker, causing less bending of the light ray. Mathematically, since b is in the denominator of the equation, an increase in b will result in a decrease in α.\n\nIn summary, the deflection angle of a light ray passing close to a massive object is directly proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the distance of closest approach."
