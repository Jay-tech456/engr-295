    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we can use the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the student, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the student (0.8c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can find the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc²\nK = (1.6667 - 1)(75 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nK = 0.6667 × 75 kg × (9 × 10^16 m²/s²)\nK ≈ 3.6 × 10^18 J\n\nSo the relativistic kinetic energy of the student is approximately 3.6 × 10^18 Joules."
