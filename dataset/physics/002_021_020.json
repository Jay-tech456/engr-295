    "message_2": "The fugacity of a gas can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nfugacity = Z * P\n\nwhere Z is the compressibility factor (Z-factor), and P is the pressure of the gas.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the pressure from MPa to bar, since the vapor pressure is given in bar:\n\n1 MPa = 10 bar\n\n2.5 MPa = 2.5 * 10 = 25 bar\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity of CO2 gas:\n\nfugacity = 0.92 * 25 bar = 23 bar\n\nSo, the fugacity of CO2 gas at a pressure of 2.5 MPa and a temperature of 298 K is 23 bar."
