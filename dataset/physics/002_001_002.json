    "message_1": "A gas undergoes a constant volume process, during which it absorbs 1200 J of heat. If the initial pressure of the gas is 1.5 atm and the final pressure is 2.5 atm. What is the work done by the gas in this process?",
    "message_2": "In a constant volume process, the volume of the gas does not change. The work done by the gas in such a process can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = PΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nSince the volume remains constant in this process (ΔV = 0), the work done by the gas is:\n\nW = PΔV = P * 0 = 0 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas in this constant volume process is 0 J."
