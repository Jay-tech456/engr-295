    "message_2": "To calculate the orbital period of a star located at a distance of 50,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. This law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit.\n\nT^2 ∝ a^3\n\nFor a star in a circular orbit around the galactic center, the semi-major axis (a) is equal to the distance from the center of the galaxy, which is 50,000 light years. We also need to know the mass of the galaxy within this orbit to determine the gravitational force acting on the star. The mass of the Milky Way within 50,000 light years is estimated to be around 5.8 x 10^10 solar masses.\n\nNow, we can use the following formula to calculate the orbital period:\n\nT = 2π√(a^3 / GM)\n\nwhere:\nT = orbital period\na = semi-major axis (50,000 light years)\nG = gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM = mass of the galaxy within the orbit (5.8 x 10^10 solar masses)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance and mass to SI units (meters and kilograms, respectively).\n\n1 light year = 9.461 x 10^15 meters\n50,000 light years = 50,000 * (9.461 x 10^15) = 4.7305 x 10^20 meters\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n5.8 x 10^10 solar masses = 5.8 x 10^10 * (1.989 x 10^30) = 1.15354 x 10^41 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nT = 2π√((4.7305 x 10^20)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 * 1.15354 x 10^41))\nT ≈ 1.558 x 10^15 seconds\n\nTo convert the orbital period to years, we can use the following conversion:\n\n1 year = 3.154 x 10^7 seconds\nT ≈ 1.558 x 10^15 / 3.154 x 10^7 ≈ 4.93 x 10^7 years\n\nSo, the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 50,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center, is approximately 49.3 million years."
