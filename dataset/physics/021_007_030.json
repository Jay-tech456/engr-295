    "message_2": "A black hole's gravitational pull has a significant effect on the orbital path of nearby celestial bodies such as stars and planets. The gravitational force exerted by a black hole is determined by its mass, and it follows the same principles as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation and Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nThe effect of a black hole's gravity on a celestial body's trajectory depends on two main factors: the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole and the celestial body.\n\n1. Mass of the black hole: A more massive black hole will exert a stronger gravitational force on nearby celestial bodies, causing them to have more curved and distorted orbits. This can lead to the formation of accretion disks around the black hole, where matter from nearby stars and planets is pulled towards the black hole and forms a rotating disk of material.\n\n2. Distance from the black hole: The gravitational force exerted by a black hole decreases with distance, following an inverse-square law. This means that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the black hole and the celestial body. As a result, celestial bodies that are closer to the black hole will experience a stronger gravitational pull and have more distorted orbits compared to those that are farther away.\n\nThe size of the celestial body also plays a role in determining its trajectory around a black hole. Larger celestial bodies, such as massive stars, will be more affected by the black hole's gravity due to their larger mass. However, the distance between the black hole and the celestial body is still the most critical factor in determining the trajectory.\n\nIn summary, the effect of a black hole's gravitational pull on the orbital path of nearby celestial bodies depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole and the celestial body. The size of the celestial body also plays a role, but the distance is the most critical factor. The closer a celestial body is to a black hole, the more its trajectory will be affected by the black hole's gravity, leading to more curved and distorted orbits."
