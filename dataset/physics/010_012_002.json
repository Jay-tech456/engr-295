    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer formed on a flat plate, we will use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * (ν / U₀)^(1/2)) * 5\n\nwhere:\nx = distance along the plate (length)\nU₀ = free-stream velocity (speed)\nν = kinematic viscosity (viscosity / density)\n\nHowever, we are given the dynamic viscosity (μ) instead of the kinematic viscosity (ν). To find the kinematic viscosity, we need the fluid's density (ρ). Assuming the fluid is air at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, the density of air is approximately 1.225 kg/m³. Therefore, the kinematic viscosity can be calculated as:\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nμ = 0.001 Pa·s\nρ = 1.225 kg/m³\nU₀ = 10 m/s\nx = 1 m\n\nν = 0.001 / 1.225 ≈ 0.0008163 m²/s\n\nδ = (1 * (0.0008163 / 10)^(1/2)) * 5 ≈ 0.0143 m\n\nThe thickness of the boundary layer formed on the flat plate is approximately 0.0143 meters or 14.3 millimeters."
