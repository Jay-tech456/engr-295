    "message_2": "The predicted mass range for supersymmetric particles that could potentially make up dark matter varies depending on the specific supersymmetric model being considered. In general, the most popular candidates for dark matter in supersymmetric theories are the lightest neutralinos, which are mixtures of photinos, zinos, and higgsinos.\n\nThe mass range for these particles is typically between a few GeV (gigaelectronvolts) to a few TeV (teraelectronvolts). For example, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the mass range for neutralinos is often considered to be between 10 GeV and 1 TeV. However, other supersymmetric models may predict different mass ranges.\n\nIt is important to note that these mass ranges are based on theoretical models and have not been experimentally confirmed. Ongoing experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and dark matter detection experiments, are actively searching for evidence of supersymmetric particles and may help to constrain or refine these mass range predictions in the future."
