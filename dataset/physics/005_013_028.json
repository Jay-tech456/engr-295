    "message_2": "In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's first find the initial momentum and kinetic energy of the system.\n\nInitial momentum of the system (P_initial):\nP_initial = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\nSince m1 = m2 = m and v2 = 0 (stationary particle),\nP_initial = m * v\n\nInitial kinetic energy of the system (KE_initial):\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m1 * v1^2 + 0.5 * m2 * v2^2\nSince m1 = m2 = m and v2 = 0,\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nNow, let's consider the collision. In the center of mass frame, the two particles have equal and opposite velocities. Let's call the final velocities of the particles v1' and v2'.\n\nSince the collision is elastic, the final kinetic energy of the system (KE_final) is equal to the initial kinetic energy (KE_initial).\n\nKE_final = 0.5 * m * v1'^2 + 0.5 * m * v2'^2\n\nAlso, the final momentum of the system (P_final) is equal to the initial momentum (P_initial).\n\nP_final = m * v1' + m * v2'\n\nSince the center of mass frame has an initial velocity of v, the final velocities of the particles are equal and opposite in the center of mass frame. Therefore, v1' = -v2'.\n\nNow, substituting this into the momentum equation:\n\nP_initial = P_final\nm * v = m * v1' + m * (-v1')\nm * v = 0\n\nThis implies that the initial velocity v of the center of mass frame is 0. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) is also 0.\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * 0^2 = 0\n\nSince the collision is elastic, the final kinetic energy (KE_final) is equal to the initial kinetic energy (KE_initial).\n\nKE_final = KE_initial = 0\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the particles after the collision is 0."
