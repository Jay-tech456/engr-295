    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves generated by a binary system consisting of two black holes, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h): h = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^2 * d)\n\nWhere:\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg)\n- a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (in m)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)\n- d is the distance from the binary system to the observer (in m)\n- M_chirp is the chirp mass, given by M_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 15 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 2.9835 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to know the semi-major axis (a) and the distance to the observer (d) to calculate the frequency and amplitude. These values are not provided in the problem, so we cannot calculate the exact frequency and amplitude without making assumptions about these values.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general approach to solving the problem. Once you have the values for a and d, you can use the formulas mentioned above to calculate the orbital frequency, gravitational wave frequency, and gravitational wave amplitude."
