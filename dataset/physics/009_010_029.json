    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the focal length (f) of the mirror and the image distance (v). \n\nThe radius of curvature (R) is given as 25 cm. The focal length (f) can be found using the formula:\n\nf = R / 2\nf = 25 cm / 2\nf = 12.5 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The mirror formula is:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. We are given the object distance (u) as 12 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1/12.5 = 1/12 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator:\n\n(1/12.5) - (1/12) = 1/v\n\n(12 - 12.5) / (12 * 12.5) = 1/v\n\n(-0.5) / 150 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can find the value of v:\n\nv = 150 / (-0.5)\nv = -300 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is a characteristic of a virtual image in a concave mirror.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v / u\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nM = -(-300) / 12\nM = 300 / 12\nM = 25\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is 25. This means the image is 25 times larger than the object."
