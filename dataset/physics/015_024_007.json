    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude and frequency spectrum of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbit):\n\nf_orbit = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW):\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbit\n\n3. Strain amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\n\n4. Chirp mass (M_chirp):\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nWhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg)\n- r is the separation between the black holes (in meters)\n- d is the distance to the observer (in meters)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to SI units:\n\n- 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\n- 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n- 100 km = 100,000 meters\n- 1 billion light-years = 1 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 meters = 9.461 x 10^24 meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (5.967 x 10^31 kg * 1.989 x 10^31 kg)^(3/5) / (5.967 x 10^31 kg + 1.989 x 10^31 kg)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 3.67 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbit = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (5.967 x 10^31 kg + 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (100,000 m)^3)\nf_orbit ≈ 1.77 x 10^-3 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * 1.77 x 10^-3 Hz\nf_GW ≈ 3.54 x 10^-3 Hz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the strain amplitude:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 3.67 x 10^31 kg * (pi * 3.54 x 10^-3 Hz)^2/3) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^4 * 9.461 x 10^24 m\nh ≈ 1.22 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves is approximately 1.22 x 10^-22, and the frequency spectrum is centered around 3.54 x 10^-3 Hz."
