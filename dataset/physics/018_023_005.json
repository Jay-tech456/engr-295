    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a dimensionless parameter that describes the strength of the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. It is a fundamental parameter in the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum field theory that describes the strong force.\n\nTo accurately determine the strong coupling constant using data from electron-positron collisions at different energies, one can follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect data from electron-positron collisions at various center-of-mass energies. These collisions produce quark-antiquark pairs, which then hadronize into jets of particles. The number and properties of these jets depend on the strong coupling constant.\n\n2. Analyze the data to measure observables sensitive to the strong force, such as the rate of production of different types of hadrons, the angular distribution of the jets, or the energy distribution of the particles within the jets.\n\n3. Compare the experimental data to theoretical predictions based on QCD. The theoretical predictions depend on the strong coupling constant, so by comparing the experimental data to the predictions, one can extract the value of αs that best fits the data.\n\n4. Perform a global fit of the strong coupling constant using data from various experiments and processes. This helps to reduce the uncertainties in the determination of αs and provides a more accurate value.\n\n5. The strong coupling constant depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, so it is important to evolve the extracted values of αs to a common energy scale using the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) of QCD. This allows for a consistent comparison of the strong coupling constant determined from different experiments and processes.\n\nBy following these steps, one can accurately determine the strong coupling constant using data from electron-positron collisions at different energies. The current world-average value of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (approximately 91 GeV) is αs(MZ) ≈ 0.1181, with an uncertainty of around 1%."
