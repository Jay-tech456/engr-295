    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nKE = hf - φ\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident photon, and φ is the work function of the metal.\n\nGiven:\nf = 5.0 x 10^15 Hz\nφ = 4.5 eV\n\nFirst, we need to convert the work function from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We can do this using the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, φ = 4.5 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 7.209 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (5.0 x 10^15 Hz) - 7.209 x 10^-19 J\nKE = 3.313 x 10^-18 J - 7.209 x 10^-19 J\nKE = 2.592 x 10^-18 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the emitted electron is approximately 2.592 x 10^-18 J."
