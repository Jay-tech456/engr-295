    "message_1": "What is the distance between the two slits in a double-slit experiment if the distance between the screen and the slits is 1.5 meters, the wavelength of the light used is 550 nanometers, and the third bright fringe from the central maximum is observed at an angle of 0.2 degrees from the center?",
    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the position of the bright fringes on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 2 for the second, etc.), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance between the screen and the slits (1.5 meters), the wavelength of the light (550 nanometers = 550 * 10^(-9) meters), and the angle of the third bright fringe (0.2 degrees). We want to find the distance between the two slits (d).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 0.2 degrees * (π/180) = 0.2 * π/180 radians ≈ 0.00349 radians\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the distance between the slits:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\nd * sin(0.00349) = 3 * (550 * 10^(-9))\nd ≈ (3 * 550 * 10^(-9)) / sin(0.00349)\n\nd ≈ 2.84 * 10^(-4) meters\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits is approximately 2.84 * 10^(-4) meters or 284 micrometers."
