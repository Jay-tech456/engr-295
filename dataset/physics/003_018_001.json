    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the central axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the helix, and x is the distance from the center of the coil.\n\nIn this case, R = 0.02 m (converted from 2 cm), x = 0.05 m (converted from 5 cm), and I = 2 A. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.02 m)²) / (2 * ((0.02 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * (0.0004 m²)) / (2 * (0.0004 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2.512 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (2 * (0.0029 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2.512 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (2 * 0.0081 m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.55 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the central axis of the helix that is 5 cm from the center of the coil is approximately 1.55 × 10^(-4) T, or 0.000155 T when rounded to two decimal places."
