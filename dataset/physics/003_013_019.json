    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the current-carrying ring, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the ring, and z is the distance from the center of the ring along the axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m\nz = 0.05 m\n\nFirst, let's calculate (R² + z²):\n\nR² + z² = (0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)² = 0.01 m² + 0.0025 m² = 0.0125 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * 0.0125^(3/2) m³)\nB ≈ 0.00000251327 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the ring, located at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the ring, is approximately 2.51 × 10^(-6) T or 2.51 μT."
