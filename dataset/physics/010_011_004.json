Assume that the liquid in the tank rotates at a uniform angular velocity. Use appropriate equations for calculating critical velocity for onset of vortex formation for a 2D or 3D cylindrical tank.",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical condition for the onset of vortex formation in a vertical cylindrical tank, we need to find the critical angular velocity (ω_c) at which the liquid starts to form a vortex. This occurs when the centrifugal force acting on the liquid overcomes the gravitational force.\n\nWe can start by considering the balance of forces acting on a small volume of liquid at a distance r from the center of the tank. The centrifugal force acting on this volume is given by:\n\nF_c = m * r * ω^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the liquid volume and ω is the angular velocity.\n\nThe gravitational force acting on the same volume of liquid is given by:\n\nF_g = m * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAt the critical condition, the centrifugal force equals the gravitational force:\n\nm * r * ω_c^2 = m * g\n\nThe mass m can be canceled out, and we can solve for the critical angular velocity:\n\nω_c^2 = g / r\n\nNow, let's consider the geometry of the tank. The radius of the tank is R, and the height of the liquid is h. The relationship between r and h can be found using similar triangles:\n\nr / h = R / H\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = (h / H) * R\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for r into the equation for ω_c^2:\n\nω_c^2 = g / ((h / H) * R)\n\nFinally, we can solve for the critical angular velocity:\n\nω_c = sqrt(g * H / (h * R))\n\nThis equation gives the critical angular velocity for the onset of vortex formation in a vertical cylindrical tank filled with liquid up to a height h. When the liquid rotates at this angular velocity, a vortex will start to form."
