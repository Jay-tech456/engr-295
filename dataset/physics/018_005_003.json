    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon-neutrino oscillating into an electron-neutrino, we can use the two-neutrino oscillation formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon-neutrino oscillating into an electron-neutrino\n- θ is the mixing angle (0.6 degrees in this case)\n- Δm² is the difference in the squares of the neutrino masses (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (735 km in this case)\n- E is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nTo proceed, we need to know the value of Δm² and the energy E of the neutrino. Since these values are not provided, we can only express the probability in terms of Δm² and E.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mixing angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 0.6 degrees * (π / 180) = 0.01047 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.01047) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * 735 / E)\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(0.02094) * sin²(935.95 * Δm² / E)\n\nThis is the probability of a muon-neutrino oscillating into an electron-neutrino in terms of Δm² and E. To obtain a numerical value, we would need the values of Δm² and E."
