    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be implemented in a superconducting quantum computer with 40 physical qubits, we need to consider the error-correction requirements.\n\nGiven that each logical qubit requires 4 physical qubits for error-correction, we can simply divide the total number of physical qubits by the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit:\n\nMaximum number of logical qubits = Total number of physical qubits / Physical qubits per logical qubit\n\nMaximum number of logical qubits = 40 / 4\n\nMaximum number of logical qubits = 10\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be implemented in a superconducting quantum computer with 40 physical qubits is 10, assuming each physical qubit has a gate error rate of 0.1% and each logical qubit requires 4 physical qubits for error-correction."
