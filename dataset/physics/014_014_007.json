    "message_2": "Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic particles originating from outside our solar system. They consist primarily of protons, atomic nuclei, and some electrons, with energies exceeding 1 x 10^18 electron volts (eV). The exact origin of UHECRs is still a subject of ongoing research, but they are believed to be produced by powerful astrophysical phenomena such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts.\n\nWhen UHECRs enter Earth's atmosphere, they interact with the nuclei of atmospheric molecules, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. This interaction produces a cascade of secondary particles, including pions, kaons, and other hadrons. These secondary particles can further decay or interact with other atmospheric nuclei, creating an extensive air shower of particles that can be detected by ground-based observatories.\n\nThe study of UHECRs is important for understanding the most energetic processes in the universe and can provide insights into fundamental physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the limits of particle acceleration."
