    "message_2": "The frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes can be estimated using the inspiral phase of the binary system. During this phase, the black holes are orbiting each other and gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves. The frequency of the emitted waves is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system.\n\nThe characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the merger.\n\nFor a binary system with masses of 10 and 20 solar masses, the total mass M = 30 solar masses, and the reduced mass μ = (10 * 20) / (10 + 20) = 200/3 solar masses. The chirp mass, which is a combination of the total mass and reduced mass, is given by:\n\nMc = μ^(3/5) * M^(2/5)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nMc ≈ 19.6 solar masses\n\nNow, we can estimate the time until the merger using the following formula:\n\nt = (5/256) * (c^5 / G^3) * (1 / Mc^5)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nt ≈ 0.008 seconds\n\nUsing the formula for the frequency, we get:\n\nf ≈ 48 Hz\n\nThis is the frequency at the beginning of the inspiral phase. As the black holes get closer, the frequency increases. The frequency at the end of the inspiral phase, just before the merger, can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf_peak = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * M)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nf_peak ≈ 157 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes with masses of 10 and 20 solar masses is approximately 48 Hz to 157 Hz.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the mass ratio is changed to 1:3. In this case, the masses of the black holes are 7.5 and 22.5 solar masses. Repeating the calculations, we get:\n\nMc ≈ 16.4 solar masses\nt ≈ 0.014 seconds\nf ≈ 37 Hz\nf_peak ≈ 134 Hz\n\nIn this case, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves is approximately 37 Hz to 134 Hz. Comparing the two cases, we can see that the frequency spectrum is shifted towards lower frequencies when the mass ratio is changed to 1:3."
