    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire carrying a current of 2 A is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.5 T. The loop has dimensions of 0.3 m x 0.5 m. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire loop, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * A) / (2 * π * R³)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current, A is the area of the loop, and R is the distance from the center of the loop to the wire.\n\nHowever, since the loop is rectangular, we need to break it down into four straight wires and calculate the magnetic field due to each wire at the center of the loop. Then, we can add up the magnetic fields due to each wire to find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop.\n\nLet's consider each wire separately:\n\n1. Wire 1: Horizontal wire at the top of the rectangle\n2. Wire 2: Vertical wire on the right side of the rectangle\n3. Wire 3: Horizontal wire at the bottom of the rectangle\n4. Wire 4: Vertical wire on the left side of the rectangle\n\nFor wires 1 and 3, the magnetic field at the center of the loop will be in the same direction (perpendicular to the plane of the loop), so we can add their magnitudes directly. The same applies to wires 2 and 4.\n\nFor the horizontal wires (1 and 3), the distance from the center of the loop to the wire is half the height of the rectangle, which is 0.5 m / 2 = 0.25 m. For the vertical wires (2 and 4), the distance from the center of the loop to the wire is half the width of the rectangle, which is 0.3 m / 2 = 0.15 m.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to each pair of wires:\n\nB_horizontal = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * R_horizontal)\nB_horizontal = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.25 m)\nB_horizontal = (8π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.5 m)\nB_horizontal = 16 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB_vertical = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * R_vertical)\nB_vertical = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m)\nB_vertical = (8π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.3 m)\nB_vertical = 26.67 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nNow, we can add the magnetic fields due to the horizontal and vertical wires to find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB_total = B_horizontal + B_vertical\nB_total = 16 × 10⁻⁷ T + 26.67 × 10⁻⁷ T\nB_total = 42.67 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 42.67 × 10⁻⁷ T."
