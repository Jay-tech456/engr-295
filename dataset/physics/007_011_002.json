    "message_2": "The minimum mass a star must have in order to undergo a supernova explosion is typically around 8 to 10 solar masses (where one solar mass is equal to the mass of our Sun). This threshold is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately 1.4 solar masses for white dwarfs. However, stars that undergo supernova explosions are usually much more massive than white dwarfs.\n\nThe mass of a star is directly related to the processes of nuclear fusion within it. In the core of a star, nuclear fusion occurs when lighter elements combine to form heavier elements, releasing energy in the process. For a star with a mass above the minimum threshold, the fusion process starts with hydrogen fusing into helium. As the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it begins to contract and heat up, allowing for the fusion of helium into heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen. This process continues with the fusion of increasingly heavier elements, up to iron.\n\nIron is significant because it has the highest binding energy per nucleon, meaning that fusing iron into heavier elements would require an input of energy rather than releasing energy. As a result, once a star has an iron core, it can no longer generate energy through nuclear fusion. The core collapses under its own gravity, causing the outer layers of the star to collapse inward as well. This rapid implosion rebounds off the dense core, resulting in a massive explosion known as a supernova.\n\nDuring a supernova, the extreme temperatures and pressures allow for the synthesis of elements heavier than iron, such as gold, platinum, and uranium. These elements, along with the lighter elements formed during the star's lifetime, are ejected into space by the explosion. The ejected material can then contribute to the formation of new stars, planets, and other celestial bodies, enriching the universe with a diverse array of elements."
