    "message_2": "The critical current density (Jc) of a superconducting wire is the maximum current density that the wire can carry without losing its superconducting properties. For YBCO (Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide) superconductors, the critical current density depends on various factors such as temperature, magnetic field, and the quality of the material.\n\nAt -196°C (77K), which is the temperature of liquid nitrogen, YBCO superconductors are known to have a high critical current density. The exact value of Jc can vary depending on the specific composition and manufacturing process of the YBCO wire. However, a typical value for Jc at 77K and zero magnetic field is around 1-5 x 10^6 A/cm².\n\nThe critical current density does not directly depend on the wire's cross-sectional area. However, the total critical current (Ic) that the wire can carry is directly proportional to its cross-sectional area (A). To find the total critical current, you can use the following formula:\n\nIc = Jc × A\n\nWhere Ic is the critical current, Jc is the critical current density, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. As the cross-sectional area of the wire increases, the total critical current that the wire can carry will also increase."
