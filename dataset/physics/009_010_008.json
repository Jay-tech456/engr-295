    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (focal length)\nu = -5 cm (object distance; negative since it's a real object)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/(-5) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20v to eliminate fractions:\n\nv = -20v + 5v^2\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n5v^2 + 20v = 0\n\nFactoring out 5v:\n\n5v(v + 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for v:\n\nv = 0 (which is not possible, as the image cannot be formed at the mirror's surface)\nv + 4 = 0 => v = -4 cm (image distance; negative since it's a virtual image)\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -(-4)/(-5)\n\nM = 4/5\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is 4/5 or 0.8."
