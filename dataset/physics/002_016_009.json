    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of a gas mixture, we can use the mole fraction weighted average method. This method involves multiplying the mole fraction of each component by its critical temperature and then summing the results.\n\nLet x_N2 and x_H2 be the mole fractions of nitrogen and hydrogen, respectively, and Tc_N2 and Tc_H2 be their critical temperatures. The critical temperature of the mixture (Tc_mix) can be calculated as follows:\n\nTc_mix = x_N2 * Tc_N2 + x_H2 * Tc_H2\n\nGiven that the mole fractions are 60% nitrogen and 40% hydrogen, we can write these as decimals:\n\nx_N2 = 0.60\nx_H2 = 0.40\n\nThe critical temperatures for nitrogen and hydrogen are given as 126 K and 33 K, respectively:\n\nTc_N2 = 126 K\nTc_H2 = 33 K\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation for Tc_mix:\n\nTc_mix = (0.60 * 126 K) + (0.40 * 33 K)\nTc_mix = 75.6 K + 13.2 K\nTc_mix = 88.8 K\n\nThe critical temperature of the gas mixture is approximately 88.8 K."
