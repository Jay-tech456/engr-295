    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconducting material is the temperature below which the material exhibits superconductivity, i.e., zero electrical resistance. The critical temperature is dependent on the magnetic field strength applied to the superconducting material. \n\nAs the magnetic field strength increases, the critical temperature of the superconducting magnet decreases. This relationship can be described by the empirical equation known as the Ginzburg-Landau equation:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nHere, Hc(T) is the critical magnetic field strength at a given temperature T, Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field strength at absolute zero temperature (0 K), and Tc is the critical temperature of the superconducting material.\n\nAccording to this equation, as the magnetic field strength (H) increases, the critical temperature (Tc) decreases. This is because the superconducting state is more stable at lower temperatures, and the presence of a strong magnetic field can disrupt the superconducting state, causing the material to transition back to its normal (non-superconducting) state. Therefore, to maintain superconductivity in the presence of a stronger magnetic field, the temperature must be lowered."
