    "message_2": "The electric and magnetic fields generated by a moving charged particle propagate at the speed of light in a vacuum. This speed is denoted by 'c' and is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 meters per second. \n\nIn this case, the charged particle is moving at a velocity of 0.8c, which is 80% of the speed of light. However, this does not affect the speed at which the electric and magnetic fields propagate. The fields will still propagate at the speed of light, c.\n\nSo, the velocity at which the electric and magnetic fields propagate from the moving charged particle is c, which is the same as the speed of light in a vacuum."
