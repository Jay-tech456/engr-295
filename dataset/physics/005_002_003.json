    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the rocket according to the physics student on the rocket, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL' = L / γ\n\nwhere L' is the length of the rocket in the frame of the physics student (the moving frame), L is the length of the rocket in the frame of the observer on Earth (the stationary frame), and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the two frames (0.8c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / √(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, we can calculate the length of the rocket according to the physics student:\n\nL' = L / γ\nL' = 100 meters / 1.667\nL' ≈ 59.98 meters\n\nSo, the length of the rocket according to the physics student on the rocket is approximately 59.98 meters."
