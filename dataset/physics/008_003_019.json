    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino changing its flavor during propagation, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum. For a two-flavor neutrino oscillation, the probability of a neutrino changing its flavor is given by:\n\nP(να → νβ) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- να and νβ are the initial and final neutrino flavors, respectively\n- θ is the mixing angle between the two mass eigenstates\n- Δm² is the difference in the squared masses of the neutrino's two mass eigenstates (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km)\n- E is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nTo solve this problem, we need the values of the mixing angle (θ), the difference in the squared masses (Δm²), and the energy of the neutrino (E). Once we have these values, we can plug them into the formula and calculate the probability of the neutrino changing its flavor over a distance of 400 km in vacuum."
