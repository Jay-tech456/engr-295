    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the interference pattern on the screen is due to the superposition of waves from two slits. The distance between the interference maxima (bright fringes) can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (m * 位 * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central maximum and the m-th interference maximum (in meters)\nm = order of the interference maximum (m = 1 for the first maximum, m = 2 for the second maximum, etc.)\n位 = wavelength of light used (in meters)\nL = distance between the screen and the slits (in meters)\nd = distance between the two slits (in meters)\n\nWe are given:\ny = 3 cm = 0.03 m (distance from the central maximum to the third interference maximum)\nm = 3 (since it's the third interference maximum)\n位 = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m (converting nanometers to meters)\nL = 2 m\n\nWe need to find the distance between the two slits (d). Rearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (m * 位 * L) / y\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nd = (3 * 500 * 10^(-9) * 2) / 0.03\n\nd = (3000 * 10^(-9)) / 0.03\n\nd = 10^(-7) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in Young's Double Slit Experiment is 10^(-7) meters or 100 nm."
