    "message_2": "To find the ratio of activation energies for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (Ea_c) to an uncatalyzed reaction (Ea_u), we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = A * exp(-Ea / R * T)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the rate constant for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is 10 times greater than the uncatalyzed reaction, we can write:\n\nk_c = 10 * k_u\n\nNow, we can write the Arrhenius equation for both the enzyme-catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions:\n\nk_c = A_c * exp(-Ea_c / R * T)\nk_u = A_u * exp(-Ea_u / R * T)\n\nDivide the enzyme-catalyzed reaction equation by the uncatalyzed reaction equation:\n\nk_c / k_u = (A_c / A_u) * exp((Ea_u - Ea_c) / R * T)\n\nSince k_c = 10 * k_u:\n\n10 = (A_c / A_u) * exp((Ea_u - Ea_c) / R * T)\n\nWe are given the difference in enthalpy between the two reactions as 5 kJ/mol, which is equal to 5000 J/mol. We can assume that the difference in activation energies is approximately equal to the difference in enthalpy:\n\nEa_u - Ea_c = 5000 J/mol\n\nThe temperature is given as 37°C, which is equal to 310.15 K. Now, we can solve for the ratio of activation energies:\n\n10 = (A_c / A_u) * exp(5000 / (8.314 * 310.15))\n\nSince we are interested in the ratio of activation energies and not the pre-exponential factors, we can assume that the ratio of pre-exponential factors (A_c / A_u) is approximately equal to 1:\n\n10 = exp(5000 / (8.314 * 310.15))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(10) = 5000 / (8.314 * 310.15)\n\nNow, solve for the ratio of activation energies:\n\nEa_c / Ea_u = 1 - (8.314 * 310.15 * ln(10) / 5000)\nEa_c / Ea_u ≈ 0.613\n\nSo, the ratio of activation energies for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to an uncatalyzed reaction is approximately 0.613."
