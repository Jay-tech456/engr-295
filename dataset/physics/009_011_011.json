    "message_1": "A lens with a refractive index of 1.5 has a radius of curvature of 30 cm on one side and 60 cm on the other. If an object is placed 10 cm from the lens, what is the distance of the image from the lens?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, n is the refractive index, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nGiven the refractive index n = 1.5, R1 = 30 cm, and R2 = -60 cm (negative since the second surface is convex), we can calculate the focal length:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/30 - 1/(-60))\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/30 + 1/60)\n1/f = 0.5 * (3/60)\n1/f = 1/40\n\nSo, the focal length f = 40 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the lens formula to find the distance of the image from the lens:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere u is the object distance, v is the image distance, and f is the focal length.\n\nGiven the object distance u = -10 cm (negative since the object is on the same side as the incoming light), we can solve for the image distance v:\n\n1/40 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/40 + 1/10\n1/v = 1/40 + 4/40\n1/v = 5/40\n\nSo, the image distance v = 40/5 = 8 cm.\n\nThe image is 8 cm away from the lens."
