    "message_1": "What is the probability of successfully teleporting an unknown quantum state using the Quantum Teleportation protocol, given that the initial state is a superposition of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle+ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle$ and the Bell state shared between the sender and receiver is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+ |11\\rangle)$?",
    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the probability of successfully teleporting an unknown quantum state is always 100% if the protocol is followed correctly. This is because the protocol is designed to transfer the quantum state from the sender to the receiver without any loss of information.\n\nIn this case, the initial state is a superposition of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle$, and the Bell state shared between the sender and receiver is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$. The protocol involves the sender performing a Bell measurement on their qubit and the unknown quantum state, which collapses the combined state into one of the four Bell states. The sender then communicates the result of their measurement to the receiver using classical communication.\n\nThe receiver, upon receiving the measurement result, performs the appropriate unitary transformation on their qubit to obtain the unknown quantum state. Since the protocol is deterministic and does not rely on any probabilistic outcomes, the probability of successfully teleporting the unknown quantum state is 100%."
