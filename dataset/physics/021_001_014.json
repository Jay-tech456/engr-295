    "message_2": "The formation of a supermassive black hole and a stellar black hole differ in terms of their mass, scale, and the processes involved in their formation.\n\n1. Mass and Scale:\nStellar black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars, typically having masses between 5 to 20 times that of our Sun. Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, have masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. Due to this difference in mass, the scale of the processes involved in their formation is also vastly different.\n\n2. Formation of Stellar Black Holes:\nStellar black holes are formed when a massive star (with a mass greater than 3 times that of our Sun) reaches the end of its life cycle. The star undergoes a supernova explosion, which is a powerful and bright event caused by the collapse of the star's core. After the explosion, if the remaining core mass is greater than approximately 3 solar masses, the gravitational force is strong enough to overcome the repulsive forces between subatomic particles, causing the core to collapse further and form a black hole.\n\n3. Formation of Supermassive Black Holes:\nThe exact formation process of supermassive black holes is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among astrophysicists. However, there are several leading theories:\n\na. Direct Collapse: In the early universe, large clouds of gas could have collapsed directly into supermassive black holes due to the absence of processes that would otherwise have led to the formation of stars. This rapid collapse would bypass the formation of a stellar black hole and create a supermassive black hole instead.\n\nb. Accretion of Mass: A stellar black hole could grow into a supermassive black hole by accreting mass from its surroundings. This process involves the black hole consuming nearby gas, dust, and even stars, increasing its mass over time. This is a slower process compared to direct collapse but could still result in the formation of a supermassive black hole.\n\nc. Mergers: Supermassive black holes could also form through the merger of smaller black holes or other massive objects. As black holes merge, their masses combine, and they grow larger. Over time, a series of mergers could lead to the formation of a supermassive black hole.\n\nIn summary, stellar black holes form from the remnants of massive stars after a supernova explosion, while supermassive black holes likely form through direct collapse, accretion of mass, or mergers of smaller black holes in the early universe. The exact processes involved in the formation of supermassive black holes are still being studied and debated by astrophysicists."
