    "message_2": "To calculate the length contraction, we can use the Lorentz contraction formula:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the original length (1.0m), v is the relative velocity (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nL = 1.0 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL = 1.0 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 1.0 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 1.0 * 0.6\n\nL = 0.6m\n\nSo, the length contraction experienced by the meter stick when it travels at 0.8c relative to an observer at rest is 0.6 meters."
