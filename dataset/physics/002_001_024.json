    "message_2": "To calculate the work done in the adiabatic and irreversible compression process, we first need to find the final temperature of the gas. For an adiabatic process, the following relation holds:\n\nT1 * (V1^(γ-1)) = T2 * (V2^(γ-1))\n\nwhere T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes, and γ is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heat capacities, Cp/Cv). For an ideal diatomic gas, γ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nGiven:\nT1 = 300 K\nV1 = 12 L\nV2 = 3 L\n\nWe can solve for T2:\n\n300 * (12^(1.4-1)) = T2 * (3^(1.4-1))\n\nT2 = 300 * (12^(0.4)) / (3^(0.4))\nT2 ≈ 300 * 2.2974\nT2 ≈ 689.22 K\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the initial and final pressures:\n\nP1 * V1 = n * R * T1\nP2 * V2 = n * R * T2\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, n is the number of moles, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K).\n\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n\nP2 / P1 = (V1 / V2) * (T2 / T1)\n\nSince V1 / V2 = 4, and T2 / T1 ≈ 2.2974:\n\nP2 / P1 ≈ 4 * 2.2974\nP2 ≈ 9.1896 * P1\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done during the irreversible adiabatic compression. For an irreversible process, the work done is given by:\n\nW = -P_ext * (V2 - V1)\n\nwhere P_ext is the external pressure. In this case, P_ext = P2.\n\nW = -9.1896 * P1 * (3 - 12)\nW = 9.1896 * P1 * 9\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find P1:\n\nP1 = n * R * T1 / V1\nP1 = (2 moles) * (8.314 J/mol*K) * (300 K) / (12 L)\nP1 ≈ 414.7 J/L\n\nFinally, we can find the work done:\n\nW = 9.1896 * 414.7 J/L * 9 L\nW ≈ 34199.5 J\n\nThe work done in the adiabatic and irreversible compression process is approximately 34,200 J."
