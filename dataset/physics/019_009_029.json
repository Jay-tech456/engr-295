    "message_2": "To calculate the one-loop beta function for the quartic scalar coupling $\\lambda$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory, we first need to consider the Lagrangian for the theory:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 - \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4\n$$\n\nThe one-loop beta function is related to the renormalization group equation, which describes how the coupling constant $\\lambda$ changes with the energy scale $\\mu$. We will use dimensional regularization to compute the one-loop correction to the $\\phi^4$ vertex. In dimensional regularization, we work in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number.\n\nThe one-loop correction to the $\\phi^4$ vertex comes from the diagram with a single loop of $\\phi$ particles. This diagram contributes a term proportional to:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^{(4)}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \\sim \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{k^2 + m^2} \\frac{1}{(k + p_1)^2 + m^2} \\frac{1}{(k + p_1 + p_2)^2 + m^2}\n$$\n\nUsing Feynman parameters and performing the integration, we find that the one-loop correction is proportional to:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^{(4)}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \\sim \\lambda^2 \\int_0^1 dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 \\delta(1 - x_1 - x_2 - x_3) \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{[k^2 + \\Delta]^3}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta = m^2 + x_1 x_2 p_1^2 + x_1 x_3 p_2^2 + x_2 x_3 p_3^2$. The integral over $k$ can be computed using standard techniques, and we find:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^{(4)}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \\sim \\lambda^2 \\int_0^1 dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 \\delta(1 - x_1 - x_2 - x_3) \\frac{\\Gamma(\\epsilon/2)}{(4\\pi)^{d/2}} \\frac{1}{\\Delta^{\\epsilon/2}}\n$$\n\nThe beta function is related to the derivative of the coupling constant with respect to the energy scale:\n\n$$\n\\beta(\\lambda) = \\mu \\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\mu} = \\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\ln\\mu}\n$$\n\nFrom the one-loop correction, we can see that the dimensionless combination $\\lambda \\mu^{-\\epsilon}$ is invariant under renormalization group transformations. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\beta(\\lambda) = -\\epsilon \\lambda + \\text{const.} \\times \\lambda^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^3)\n$$\n\nNow, we can determine whether the coupling is relevant, irrelevant, or marginal by looking at the sign of the coefficient of $\\lambda$ in the beta function. In our case, the coefficient is $-\\epsilon$, which is negative since $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number. This means that the coupling $\\lambda$ is relevant, as it increases when we go to lower energy scales (or longer distances)."
