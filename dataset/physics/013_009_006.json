Also, how does the process of star formation occur in these molecular clouds? Describe the role played by different physical processes in the formation of stars from a molecular cloud.",
    "message_2": "Molecular clouds make up about 15% of the visible matter in the interstellar medium. These clouds are primarily composed of molecular hydrogen (H2) and helium, along with trace amounts of other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) and dust particles. The typical temperatures of molecular clouds range from 10 to 20 Kelvin (-263 to -253 degrees Celsius), and their densities vary from 100 to 10^6 particles per cubic centimeter.\n\nThe process of star formation in molecular clouds begins with the gravitational collapse of a dense region within the cloud. Several factors can trigger this collapse, such as shockwaves from nearby supernovae, collisions between molecular clouds, or the gravitational influence of nearby massive stars. As the cloud collapses, it fragments into smaller clumps, which continue to collapse under their own gravity. These clumps eventually form dense cores, where the pressure and temperature increase.\n\nDuring the collapse, several physical processes play a role in the formation of stars:\n\n1. Gravitational forces: The primary force driving the collapse of the molecular cloud is gravity. As the cloud collapses, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the temperature and pressure to increase.\n\n2. Thermal pressure: As the temperature and pressure increase, thermal pressure acts as a counterbalance to gravity, preventing further collapse. However, if the cloud's mass is above a critical value known as the Jeans mass, gravity will eventually overcome thermal pressure, leading to the formation of a protostar.\n\n3. Magnetic fields: Magnetic fields can also play a role in the star formation process by providing additional support against gravitational collapse. However, as the cloud collapses, the magnetic field lines become more concentrated, eventually reaching a point where they can no longer provide sufficient support.\n\n4. Angular momentum: As the cloud collapses, it conserves angular momentum, causing it to rotate faster. This rotation can lead to the formation of a disk around the protostar, from which planets may eventually form.\n\n5. Radiative processes: As the protostar continues to collapse, its temperature increases, causing it to emit radiation. This radiation can exert pressure on the surrounding material, potentially slowing down or even halting the collapse.\n\nOnce the core of the collapsing cloud reaches a high enough temperature and pressure, nuclear fusion begins, and a new star is born. The remaining material in the surrounding disk can continue to accrete onto the star or form planets through a process known as core accretion or gravitational instability."
