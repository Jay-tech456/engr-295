    "message_2": "The minimum mass of sterile neutrinos required for them to be a viable candidate for dark matter depends on their production mechanism and the cosmological constraints. Generally, the mass range considered for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is between 1 keV and 100 keV. \n\nSterile neutrinos with masses around 1 keV to a few keV are considered \"warm dark matter\" candidates. They can help alleviate some of the issues faced by cold dark matter models, such as the overprediction of the number of small-scale structures. However, if the mass of sterile neutrinos is too low, they would behave like \"hot dark matter,\" which is ruled out by observations of the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nOn the other hand, the observed limits on the masses of the active neutrinos from particle experiments are much smaller. The squared mass differences from neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate has a mass below 0.1 eV, while the heaviest one is below 0.06 eV. Direct measurements from tritium beta decay experiments set an upper limit of about 2 eV for the electron neutrino mass.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass of sterile neutrinos required for them to be a viable dark matter candidate is significantly larger than the observed limits on the masses of active neutrinos from particle experiments. This difference in mass scales allows for the possibility that sterile neutrinos could make up a significant fraction of the dark matter in the universe, while active neutrinos contribute only a small fraction."
