    "message_2": "For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and can be given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π, where h is the Planck constant), and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nIn this case, the frequency is given as 2πω. To find the angular frequency, we can use the relation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nwhere f is the frequency. Therefore, ω = f.\n\nNow, we can plug this into the energy formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω = (n + 1/2)ħ(2πω)\n\nSo, the energy of the nth excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency 2πω and mass m is:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħ(2πω)"
