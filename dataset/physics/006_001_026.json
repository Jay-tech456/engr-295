    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required for the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=3 energy level to the n=2 energy level, we can use the Rydberg formula for energy difference:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level (n=2), and ni is the initial energy level (n=3).\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/3^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1/9)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (5/36)\n\nΔE ≈ -1.89 eV\n\nSo, the energy required for the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=3 energy level to the n=2 energy level is approximately 1.89 eV."
