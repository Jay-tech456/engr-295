    "message_2": "Gravitational lensing is an effect caused by the bending of light due to the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a black hole. The degree of lensing depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the light source.\n\nIn this case, we are comparing two black holes: one with double the mass of our sun (2M☉) and another with half the mass of our sun (0.5M☉). The gravitational lensing effect will be stronger for the more massive black hole, as it has a stronger gravitational field.\n\nTo quantify the difference in the lensing effect, we can use the formula for the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole:\n\nRs = (2GM) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor the 2M☉ black hole:\nRs(2M☉) = (2G(2M☉)) / c^2\n\nFor the 0.5M☉ black hole:\nRs(0.5M☉) = (2G(0.5M☉)) / c^2\n\nNow, let's compare the Schwarzschild radii of the two black holes:\n\nRs(2M☉) / Rs(0.5M☉) = (2G(2M☉)) / (2G(0.5M☉)) = 4/1 = 4\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of the 2M☉ black hole is 4 times larger than that of the 0.5M☉ black hole. This means that the gravitational lensing effect will be stronger for the more massive black hole, as the light will be bent more significantly around it.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the actual lensing effect observed will also depend on other factors, such as the alignment of the black hole, light source, and observer, as well as the distances between them."
