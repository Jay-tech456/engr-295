    "message_2": "In the Quantum Teleportation protocol, the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) share an entangled state, usually a Bell state. The fidelity of the entangled state is a measure of how close the shared state is to a perfect Bell state. A fidelity of 1 means the state is a perfect Bell state, while a fidelity of 0 means the state is completely uncorrelated.\n\nGiven the fidelity F of the entangled state, the probability of successfully teleporting the state of a two-level quantum system (qubit) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nP_success = (F + 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, the fidelity F is given as 0.8. Plugging this into the formula:\n\nP_success = (0.8 + 1) / 2\nP_success = 1.8 / 2\nP_success = 0.9\n\nSo, the probability of successfully teleporting the state of a qubit using the Quantum Teleportation protocol with a fidelity of 0.8 is 0.9, or 90%."
