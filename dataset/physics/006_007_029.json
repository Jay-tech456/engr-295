    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, an electron collides with a mercury atom and transfers energy to the atom, causing it to become excited. The minimum potential difference required for this inelastic collision corresponds to the energy required to excite the mercury atom to its first excited state.\n\nFor mercury, the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is approximately 4.9 eV (electron volts). Therefore, the minimum potential difference required to cause an inelastic collision between an electron and a mercury atom in the Franck-Hertz experiment is 4.9 V (volts).\n\nFor different excited states of the mercury atom, the minimum potential difference will differ because the energy difference between the ground state and higher excited states will be different. The energy levels of mercury are quantized, meaning that the energy differences between the ground state and higher excited states are not uniform. As the energy levels increase, the energy differences between consecutive levels generally decrease.\n\nTo calculate the minimum potential difference for a specific excited state, you would need to know the energy difference between the ground state and that excited state. The minimum potential difference would then be equal to the energy difference divided by the elementary charge (e ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-19) C).\n\nFor example, if the energy difference between the ground state and a higher excited state is 6.7 eV, the minimum potential difference required for an inelastic collision would be 6.7 V."
