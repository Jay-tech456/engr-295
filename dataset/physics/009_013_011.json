    "message_2": "Spherical aberration is an optical effect that occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point. In a plano-convex lens, this is caused by the curvature of the lens surface, which results in light rays at different distances from the optical axis being refracted by different amounts. This leads to a distortion in the image formed by the lens.\n\nTo understand how the spherical aberration of a plano-convex lens changes as the distance of the object from the lens is varied, let's consider the following factors:\n\n1. Lens shape: A plano-convex lens has one flat surface and one curved surface. The spherical aberration is minimized when the curved surface faces the object (i.e., the object is closer to the curved surface). This is because the light rays entering the lens at different distances from the optical axis are refracted more similarly when they pass through the curved surface first.\n\n2. Object distance: As the object distance from the lens increases, the incoming light rays become more parallel to the optical axis. This reduces the difference in the angles at which the light rays enter the lens, and thus, the spherical aberration decreases.\n\n3. Focal length: The focal length of the lens also plays a role in the spherical aberration. A lens with a shorter focal length will have a stronger curvature, which can lead to a higher degree of spherical aberration. However, the relationship between the object distance and the spherical aberration remains the same: as the object distance increases, the spherical aberration decreases.\n\nIn summary, the spherical aberration of a plano-convex lens decreases as the distance of the object from the lens increases. This is due to the incoming light rays becoming more parallel to the optical axis, reducing the difference in the angles at which they enter the lens and thus minimizing the distortion caused by the lens curvature."
