    "message_2": "To calculate the work function of the atom, we can use the equation for the photoelectric effect:\n\nK.E. = h * f - W\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, h is the Planck's constant, f is the threshold frequency, and W is the work function.\n\nWe are given the threshold frequency (f) as 6.0 x 10^14 Hz and the kinetic energy (K.E.) as 5.0 x 10^-19 J. The Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the work function (W):\n\nW = h * f - K.E.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nW = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (6.0 x 10^14 Hz) - (5.0 x 10^-19 J)\n\nW = (3.9756 x 10^-19 J) - (5.0 x 10^-19 J)\n\nW = -1.0244 x 10^-19 J\n\nSince the work function cannot be negative, there must be an error in the given values. Please check the values and try again."
