    "message_2": "The likelihood that ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) could be generated by black holes is a topic of ongoing research and debate in the astrophysics community. UHECRs are extremely energetic particles, primarily protons, with energies exceeding 10^18 electron volts (eV). Their origin is still not well understood, but several astrophysical sources have been proposed, including black holes.\n\nOne possibility is that UHECRs could be generated in the vicinity of black holes through a process called \"acceleration by shocks.\" In this scenario, particles are accelerated to ultra-high energies by the strong gravitational fields and electromagnetic forces near the black hole. This process could occur in the accretion disk surrounding the black hole or in the relativistic jets that are ejected from the vicinity of the black hole.\n\nThe most probable sources of UHECRs, if generated by black holes, would be supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centers of active galaxies, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGN). SMBHs have masses ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun and are surrounded by a massive accretion disk of gas and dust. The strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of SMBHs can create the necessary conditions for particle acceleration to ultra-high energies.\n\nAnother possible source of UHECRs could be stellar-mass black holes in binary systems, where a black hole is orbiting a companion star. In these systems, the black hole can accrete material from the companion star, forming an accretion disk and potentially generating relativistic jets. However, the energy output from these systems is generally lower than that of AGN, making them less likely sources of UHECRs.\n\nIt is important to note that while black holes are considered as potential sources of UHECRs, other astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts and supernova remnants, are also being investigated. Further observational and theoretical studies are needed to pinpoint the exact origin of these enigmatic particles."
