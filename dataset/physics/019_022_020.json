    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories: a quantum field theory (QFT) with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry and a string theory defined on an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The correspondence states that the QFT is equivalent to a higher-dimensional gravitational theory, with the extra dimension being holographically related to the QFT.\n\nTo apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate holographic dualities in a quantum field theory with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry, follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify the QFT and its non-Abelian gauge symmetry: The first step is to specify the quantum field theory of interest and its non-Abelian gauge group. For example, the original AdS/CFT correspondence proposed by Maldacena relates N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group SU(N) to Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5.\n\n2. Determine the corresponding AdS space and string theory: Once the QFT is identified, determine the appropriate AdS space and string theory that are conjectured to be dual to the QFT. In the case of N=4 SYM, the dual theory is Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5, where AdS_5 is a 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space and S^5 is a 5-dimensional sphere.\n\n3. Calculate observables using the AdS/CFT correspondence: The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a dictionary that relates observables in the QFT to those in the dual string theory. This dictionary allows one to calculate quantities in the QFT by performing calculations in the dual string theory. For example, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators in the QFT can be computed by calculating the corresponding string theory amplitudes in the AdS space.\n\n4. Check for consistency and universality: The AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjecture, and its validity is supported by numerous consistency checks and examples. To gain confidence in the results obtained using the correspondence, it is essential to verify that the results are consistent with known properties of the QFT and that they exhibit the expected universality properties.\n\nIn summary, applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate holographic dualities in a quantum field theory with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry involves identifying the QFT and its gauge group, determining the corresponding AdS space and string theory, using the AdS/CFT dictionary to calculate observables, and checking for consistency and universality. While the correspondence has been extensively tested and applied in various contexts, it is important to remember that it remains a conjecture, and its full scope and validity are still being explored."
