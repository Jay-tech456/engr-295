    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational time dilation experienced by the spaceship in orbit around the black hole, we need to consider the Schwarzschild metric, which is a simplified version of the Kerr metric for non-rotating black holes. This simplification allows us to focus on the main effect of the black hole's mass on time dilation, without the added complexity of rotation.\n\nFirst, let's define some constants:\n\nG = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\nM_sun = 1.989 × 10^30 kg (mass of the sun)\nr = 100 km = 100 × 10^3 m (orbital radius)\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of the black hole:\n\nM_black_hole = 10 × M_sun = 10 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s) of the black hole:\n\nR_s = (2 × G × M_black_hole) / c^2\n\nR_s = (2 × 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.989 × 10^31 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nR_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^4 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the gravitational time dilation factor (γ) using the following formula:\n\nγ = (1 - R_s / r)^0.5\n\nγ = (1 - 2.95 × 10^4 m / 1.00 × 10^5 m)^0.5\nγ ≈ 0.86\n\nThis means that time on the spaceship is running slower than time far away from the black hole by a factor of 0.86. In other words, for every second that passes on the spaceship, approximately 1.16 seconds pass far away from the black hole."
