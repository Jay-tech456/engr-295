    "message_2": "The Bethe-Bloch formula for charged particle stopping power is given by:\n\nS = (4πe⁴z²N_Aρ)/(m_ev²) * (Z/A) * (1/v²) * ln(2m_ev²γ²β²/I)\n\nwhere:\nS is the stopping power\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\nz is the charge of the incident particle (protons have a charge of +1)\nN_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^(23) mol^(-1))\nρ is the density of the material (Aluminum has a density of 2.7 g/cm³)\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\nv is the velocity of the incident particle\nZ is the atomic number of the material (Aluminum has Z = 13)\nA is the atomic mass of the material (Aluminum has A = 26.98 g/mol)\nγ is the Lorentz factor (γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²))\nβ is the velocity of the incident particle divided by the speed of light (β = v/c)\nI is the mean excitation energy of the material (Aluminum has I ≈ 166 eV)\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity (v) of the 2 MeV proton. The kinetic energy of the proton is given by:\n\nT = (1/2)mv²\n\nwhere m is the mass of the proton (1.673 x 10^(-27) kg) and T is the kinetic energy (2 MeV = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J). Solving for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2T/m) = sqrt(2 * 3.204 x 10^(-13) J / 1.673 x 10^(-27) kg) ≈ 3.064 x 10^7 m/s\n\nNow we can find β:\n\nβ = v/c = 3.064 x 10^7 m/s / 2.998 x 10^8 m/s ≈ 0.102\n\nNext, we find the Lorentz factor γ:\n\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.102²) ≈ 1.005\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the Bethe-Bloch formula:\n\nS = (4π * (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)⁴ * 1² * (6.022 x 10^(23) mol^(-1)) * (2.7 g/cm³)) / ((9.109 x 10^(-31) kg) * (3.064 x 10^7 m/s)²) * (13/26.98) * (1/0.102²) * ln(2 * (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg) * (3.064 x 10^7 m/s)² * 1.005² * 0.102² / (166 eV))\n\nS ≈ 0.153 MeV/(mg/cm²)\n\nSo, the stopping power of aluminum for a 2 MeV proton is approximately 0.153 MeV/(mg/cm²)."
