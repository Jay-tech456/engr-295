    "message_2": "To find the radius of the copper-64 nucleus, we can use the formula for the nuclear density:\n\nnuclear density = mass / volume\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the copper-64 nucleus. Copper-64 has 29 protons and 35 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.675 x 10^-27 kg. \n\nmass of copper-64 nucleus = (29 protons * mass of a proton) + (35 neutrons * mass of a neutron)\nmass of copper-64 nucleus = (29 * 1.67 x 10^-27 kg) + (35 * 1.675 x 10^-27 kg)\nmass of copper-64 nucleus ≈ 1.064 x 10^-25 kg\n\nNow, we can use the nuclear density formula to find the volume of the copper-64 nucleus:\n\nvolume = mass / nuclear density\nvolume ≈ 1.064 x 10^-25 kg / (8.0 x 10^17 kg/m^3)\nvolume ≈ 1.33 x 10^-43 m^3\n\nThe nucleus can be assumed to be spherical, so we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the radius:\n\nvolume = (4/3)πr^3\n\nSolving for the radius, we get:\n\nr^3 = (3/4π) * volume\nr^3 ≈ (3/4π) * 1.33 x 10^-43 m^3\nr^3 ≈ 3.18 x 10^-44 m^3\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\nr ≈ (3.18 x 10^-44 m^3)^(1/3)\nr ≈ 6.82 x 10^-15 m\n\nSo, the radius of the copper-64 nucleus is approximately 6.82 x 10^-15 meters."
