    "message_1": "In a Young's double slit experiment, a laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm is used to create an interference pattern on a screen that is 2.4 meters away from the slits. If the distance between the two slits is 0.3 mm, what is the distance between the central maximum and the third bright fringe in the interference pattern?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central maximum and the third bright fringe, we can use the formula for the position of bright fringes in a Young's double slit experiment:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe\nm = order of the bright fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 2 for the second, etc.)\nλ = wavelength of the light (in meters)\nL = distance between the slits and the screen (in meters)\nd = distance between the two slits (in meters)\n\nFor the third bright fringe (m = 3), we have:\n\nλ = 632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-9) m\nL = 2.4 m\nd = 0.3 mm = 0.3 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ny = (3 * 632.8 * 10^(-9) * 2.4) / (0.3 * 10^(-3))\ny = (3 * 632.8 * 10^(-9) * 2.4) / (0.3 * 10^(-3))\ny ≈ 0.01512 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the third bright fringe is approximately 0.01512 meters or 15.12 mm."
