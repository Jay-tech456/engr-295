    "message_2": "To determine the minimum velocity at which air flows over an airplane wing before it experiences flow separation, we can use the Reynolds number (Re), which is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid flow. The critical Reynolds number for flow separation over a cambered airfoil is typically around 500,000.\n\nRe = (density * velocity * chord_length) / viscosity\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the minimum velocity:\n\nvelocity = (Re * viscosity) / (density * chord_length)\n\nGiven the air density (ρ) = 1.23 kg/m³, the viscosity of air (μ) = 1.82 x 10^-5 Pa·s, and the chord length (c) = 1.5 meters, we can calculate the minimum velocity:\n\nvelocity = (500,000 * 1.82 x 10^-5) / (1.23 * 1.5)\nvelocity ≈ 39.35 m/s\n\nThe minimum velocity at which air flows over the airplane wing before it experiences flow separation is approximately 39.35 m/s.\n\nTo calculate the angle of attack at which the wing stalls, we can use the lift coefficient (Cl) and the lift curve slope (Cl_alpha). For a typical airfoil, the maximum lift coefficient (Cl_max) occurs at a stall angle of attack (α_stall) of around 15 degrees. The lift curve slope (Cl_alpha) for a thin airfoil is approximately 2π per radian or 0.11 per degree.\n\nCl_max = Cl_alpha * α_stall\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the stall angle of attack:\n\nα_stall = Cl_max / Cl_alpha\n\nAssuming a maximum lift coefficient (Cl_max) of 1.5 for a cambered airfoil with a 10% camber, we can calculate the stall angle of attack:\n\nα_stall = 1.5 / 0.11\nα_stall ≈ 13.64 degrees\n\nThe angle of attack at which the wing stalls is approximately 13.64 degrees."
