    "message_2": "The beta function is a central concept in the study of renormalization properties of a quantum field theory (QFT). It describes how the coupling constants of a QFT change as a function of the energy scale (or renormalization scale) at which the theory is probed. The beta function is crucial for understanding the behavior of a QFT at different energy scales and for determining the fixed points of the theory, which are essential for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena.\n\nIn the Wilsonian approach to renormalization, the idea is to integrate out high-energy degrees of freedom in a systematic way, which leads to an effective theory at lower energies. The beta function can be computed by studying how the effective action changes as we integrate out these high-energy degrees of freedom.\n\nLet's consider a scalar field theory in four dimensions with a Lagrangian given by:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂_μ φ)² - 1/2 m² φ² - λ/4! φ⁴\n\nHere, φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the quartic coupling constant. We want to compute the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant λ.\n\nTo do this, we first introduce a momentum cutoff Λ, which separates high-energy and low-energy degrees of freedom. We then integrate out the high-energy degrees of freedom by performing a path integral over the high-energy modes of the field. This leads to an effective action for the low-energy modes, which can be written as:\n\nS_eff[φ] = ∫ d⁴x [1/2 (∂_μ φ)² - 1/2 m² φ² - λ_eff/4! φ⁴]\n\nHere, λ_eff is the effective coupling constant at the lower energy scale. The one-loop beta function is given by the derivative of λ_eff with respect to the logarithm of the cutoff Λ:\n\nβ(λ) = Λ ∂λ_eff/∂Λ\n\nTo compute β(λ) at one-loop order, we need to calculate the one-loop correction to the quartic coupling constant. This can be done using Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory. The relevant diagram is the \"fish\" diagram, which involves two φ⁴ vertices connected by four scalar field propagators.\n\nAfter performing the loop integration and taking the derivative with respect to the logarithm of the cutoff Λ, we find the one-loop beta function for the quartic coupling constant:\n\nβ(λ) = (3/2π²) λ²\n\nNow, we can determine the fixed points of the theory by setting the beta function to zero:\n\nβ(λ*) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: λ* = 0 (the Gaussian fixed point) and λ* = ∞ (the non-interacting fixed point). The Gaussian fixed point corresponds to a free scalar field theory, while the non-interacting fixed point corresponds to a strongly coupled theory. The stability of these fixed points and their relevance to phase transitions and critical phenomena can be further analyzed using the renormalization group and the concept of relevant and irrelevant operators."
