    "message_2": "The Bohr radius is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m_e is the mass of the electron, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nHowever, since we are given the total energy of the electron in the ground state (-13.6 eV), we can use another approach to find the Bohr radius. The total energy of the electron in the ground state can be expressed as:\n\nE = - (e²) / (8πε₀ * a₀)\n\nNow, we can solve for a₀:\n\na₀ = - (e²) / (8πε₀ * E)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nε₀ = 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm² (vacuum permittivity)\ne = 1.602 x 10^(-19) C (elementary charge)\nE = -13.6 eV = -13.6 * 1.602 x 10^(-19) J (converting eV to Joules)\n\na₀ = - (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)² / (8π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm² * -13.6 * 1.602 x 10^(-19) J)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.29 x 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius for a hydrogen atom with an electron in the ground state having a total energy of -13.6 eV is approximately 5.29 x 10^(-11) meters or 52.9 pm (picometers)."
