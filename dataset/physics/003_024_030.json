    "message_1": "A current-carrying inductor has 200 turns and a length of 0.5 m. It produces a magnetic field of 0.005 T at a distance of 2 cm. What is the magnitude of the current flowing through the inductor?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the current flowing through the inductor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is proportional to the current (I) and the number of turns (N) in the wire, and inversely proportional to the distance (r) from the wire.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field produced by a solenoid (inductor) is:\n\nB = μ₀ * N * I / L\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and L is the length of the solenoid.\n\nWe are given the magnetic field (B = 0.005 T), the number of turns (N = 200), the length of the solenoid (L = 0.5 m), and the distance from the solenoid (r = 0.02 m). We need to find the current (I).\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the formula to solve for I:\n\nI = B * L / (μ₀ * N)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nI = (0.005 T) * (0.5 m) / (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 200)\n\nI ≈ (0.0025 Tm) / (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n\nI ≈ 0.0025 / (8π × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ 995.04 A\n\nThe magnitude of the current flowing through the inductor is approximately 995.04 A."
