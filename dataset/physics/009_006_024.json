    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nMagnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 600 / 50\nv = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -12/30\nM = -0.4\n\nSo, the image distance is 12 cm, and the magnification produced by the mirror is -0.4. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
