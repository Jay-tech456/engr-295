    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy in the collision. Let's denote the mass of each particle as m, and the initial kinetic energy of each particle as K = 20 MeV. The initial velocity of each particle is 0.8c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial momentum of each particle. The relativistic momentum formula is:\n\np = γmv\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nFor v = 0.8c, we have:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 5/3\n\nNow, we can find the initial momentum of each particle:\n\np = (5/3)mv\n\nSince it's a head-on collision, the total momentum after the collision is zero:\n\np_total = p1 + p2 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the initial total energy of the system. The relativistic energy formula is:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of each particle is given as K = 20 MeV. We can find the rest energy of each particle:\n\nE_rest = mc^2\n\nThe total initial energy of each particle is:\n\nE_total = E_rest + K\n\nSince there are two particles, the total initial energy of the system is:\n\nE_system_initial = 2 * E_total\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy of the system after the collision. Since the total momentum after the collision is zero, the two particles must be combined into a single particle with rest mass M and zero velocity. The energy of this combined particle is:\n\nE_system_final = Mc^2\n\nBy conservation of energy, we have:\n\nE_system_initial = E_system_final\n\nNow, we can find the change in kinetic energy:\n\nΔK = K_system_final - K_system_initial\n\nSince the final particle is at rest, its kinetic energy is zero:\n\nΔK = 0 - 2 * K = -40 MeV\n\nSo, the change in kinetic energy of the particle after the collision is -40 MeV."
