    "message_2": "To calculate the internal energy of 1 kg of water at a temperature of 50°C, we need to find the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of the water from a reference temperature (usually 0°C) to 50°C. We don't need to consider the latent heat of vaporization in this case, as the water is not undergoing a phase change.\n\nGiven:\nMass of water (m) = 1 kg = 1000 g (since 1 kg = 1000 g)\nSpecific heat capacity of water (c) = 4.18 J/g°C\nChange in temperature (ΔT) = 50°C - 0°C = 50°C\n\nWe can use the formula for heat energy (Q) to calculate the internal energy:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nQ = (1000 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (50°C)\nQ = 1000 × 4.18 × 50\nQ = 209000 J\n\nSo, the internal energy of 1 kg of water at a temperature of 50°C is 209,000 Joules."
