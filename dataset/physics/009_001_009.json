    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this problem, n1 (refractive index of air) is approximately 1, θ1 (angle of incidence) is 30 degrees, and n2 (refractive index of glass) is 1.5. We want to find θ2 (angle of refraction).\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5 (since sine of 30 degrees is 0.5)\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.5 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.3333 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.3333:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 19.47 degrees."
