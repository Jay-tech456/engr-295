    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of a dark matter particle being produced during the evaporation of a black hole through Hawking radiation, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The energy spectrum of Hawking radiation: Hawking radiation is a thermal radiation with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole (T ~ 1/M). The energy spectrum of this radiation follows the Planck distribution.\n\n2. The mass of the dark matter particle: The mass of the dark matter particle (m_DM) is still unknown, but it is generally assumed to be in the range of a few GeV to a few TeV.\n\n3. The energy threshold for dark matter production: To produce a dark matter particle, the energy of the Hawking radiation must be at least equal to the mass of the dark matter particle (E >= m_DM).\n\nNow, let's estimate the probability:\n\n1. Calculate the fraction of Hawking radiation with energy above the dark matter mass threshold. This can be done by integrating the Planck distribution from m_DM to infinity and normalizing it by the total energy emitted by the black hole.\n\n2. Multiply this fraction by the number of Hawking radiation particles emitted during the evaporation process. This number is proportional to the initial mass of the black hole (M) and the evaporation time (t_evap).\n\nThe probability of dark matter production will be given by the product of these two factors. However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate, as there are still many unknowns in the nature of dark matter and the details of the Hawking radiation process. Additionally, this probability will be highly dependent on the mass of the dark matter particle and the mass of the black hole, so it is difficult to provide a specific numerical value without more information."
