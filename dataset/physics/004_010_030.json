    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) equation is given by:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFor a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass into kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so 10 solar masses would be:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius equation:\n\nr_s = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 29.5 kilometers."
