    "message_1": "What will be the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of a parallel plate capacitor of length 10 cm and width 5 cm, carrying a current of 2 A, if the plates are separated by a distance of 2 mm and have a potential difference of 6 V between them?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the electric field between the plates of the capacitor. The formula for the electric field (E) between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor is given by:\n\nE = V / d\n\nwhere V is the potential difference between the plates (6 V) and d is the distance between the plates (2 mm = 0.002 m).\n\nE = 6 V / 0.002 m = 3000 V/m\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the center of the capacitor. Since the current is flowing through the capacitor, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field. However, the Biot-Savart law is quite complex and requires integration, which is not necessary in this case because the magnetic field due to a parallel plate capacitor is negligible.\n\nThe reason for this is that the magnetic field produced by the current in one plate is almost entirely canceled out by the magnetic field produced by the current in the other plate (in the opposite direction). Therefore, the net magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the capacitor is approximately zero.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the parallel plate capacitor is approximately 0 T (tesla)."
