    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the Biot-Savart law. However, we first need to find the length of the wire carrying the current that contributes to the magnetic field at the given point. We can do this by using the geometry of the problem.\n\nLet's denote the length of the wire contributing to the magnetic field as L. Since the point is located 0.03 m away from the plate edge on a line perpendicular to the plates, we can form a right triangle with the plate separation (0.02 m) as one side, the distance from the edge (0.03 m) as the other side, and the length L as the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find L:\n\nL^2 = (0.02)^2 + (0.03)^2\nL^2 = 0.0004 + 0.0009\nL^2 = 0.0013\nL = √0.0013 ≈ 0.0361 m\n\nNow we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field B at the given point. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field due to a small segment of wire carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the wire segment, θ is the angle between the wire segment and the line connecting the wire segment to the point, and r is the distance from the wire segment to the point.\n\nIn our case, the angle θ is 90 degrees (since the point is on a line perpendicular to the plates), so sinθ = 1. The distance r is equal to the plate separation (0.02 m). Therefore, we can write the Biot-Savart law for our problem as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * (0.02)^2)\n\nIntegrating this expression over the length L of the wire, we get the total magnetic field B at the given point:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * (0.02)^2) * ∫(dl) from 0 to L\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * (0.02)^2) * L\n\nNow we can plug in the values and find the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (4 * π * (0.02 m)^2) * 0.0361 m\nB ≈ (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.0004π m^2) * 0.0361 m\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-6) T) * 0.0361\nB ≈ 7.22 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point is approximately 7.22 × 10^(-8) T."
