    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt 5 kg of ice at 0°C and convert it into water at 0°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = m * Lf\n\nwhere Q is the amount of heat required, m is the mass of the ice, and Lf is the latent heat of fusion of ice.\n\nGiven:\nm = 5 kg (mass of ice)\nLf = 3.34 × 10^5 J/kg (latent heat of fusion of ice)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = 5 kg * 3.34 × 10^5 J/kg\n\nQ = 1.67 × 10^6 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to melt 5 kg of ice at 0°C and convert it into water at 0°C is 1.67 × 10^6 Joules."
