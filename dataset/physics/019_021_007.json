    "message_2": "Calculating scattering amplitudes for strings in quantum field theory using the worldsheet formalism approach of string theory involves several steps. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Choose a suitable worldsheet: In the worldsheet formalism, the history of a string is represented by a two-dimensional surface called the worldsheet. For scattering amplitudes, the worldsheet is typically chosen to be a Riemann surface with a certain number of punctures, which represent the insertion points of the external string states.\n\n2. Define the worldsheet action: The dynamics of the string are governed by an action, which is a functional of the embedding functions of the worldsheet into spacetime and the worldsheet metric. For the bosonic string, the action is given by the Polyakov action, while for the superstring, one uses the super-Polyakov action.\n\n3. Compute the path integral: The scattering amplitude is given by a path integral over all possible worldsheet configurations, weighted by the exponential of the action. This involves integrating over the embedding functions and the worldsheet metric, as well as summing over all possible topologies of the worldsheet.\n\n4. Introduce vertex operators: To account for the external string states, one introduces vertex operators, which are local operators on the worldsheet that create and annihilate string excitations. These operators are inserted at the punctures of the Riemann surface and are integrated over the worldsheet.\n\n5. Gauge-fix the worldsheet symmetries: The worldsheet action has local symmetries, such as reparametrization invariance and Weyl invariance, which need to be fixed in order to perform the path integral. This is typically done using the Faddeev-Popov procedure, which introduces ghost fields and a BRST charge.\n\n6. Compute the correlation functions: The scattering amplitude is given by the correlation function of the vertex operators and the ghost fields on the worldsheet. This can be computed using conformal field theory techniques, such as the operator product expansion and the mode expansion of the fields.\n\n7. Integrate over the moduli space: The final step is to integrate the correlation function over the moduli space of the Riemann surface, which parameterizes the different shapes and sizes of the worldsheet. This involves computing various determinants and integrating over the positions of the punctures and the moduli of the worldsheet.\n\nBy following these steps, one can compute the scattering amplitudes for strings in quantum field theory using the worldsheet formalism approach of string theory. However, it's important to note that this is a highly technical and complex process that requires a deep understanding of string theory, conformal field theory, and Riemann surface theory."
