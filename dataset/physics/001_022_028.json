    "message_2": "Hawking Radiation is a theoretical process first proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking in 1974. It describes the emission of particles and radiation from the event horizon of a black hole due to quantum effects near the black hole's boundary. This phenomenon is a result of the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nIn simple terms, Hawking Radiation occurs when a particle-antiparticle pair is created near the event horizon of a black hole. One of the particles falls into the black hole, while the other escapes. The escaping particle is considered as radiation emitted by the black hole. This process reduces the mass of the black hole, causing it to lose energy.\n\nThe effect of Hawking Radiation on the lifespan of a black hole is that it causes the black hole to evaporate over time. As the black hole loses mass, its temperature increases, which in turn increases the rate of Hawking Radiation emission. This process continues until the black hole has lost all of its mass and evaporates completely.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the rate of Hawking Radiation is extremely slow for massive black holes, such as those formed by the collapse of massive stars. For these black holes, the evaporation process would take an incredibly long time, much longer than the current age of the universe. On the other hand, smaller black holes, known as primordial black holes, could evaporate much faster due to their higher temperatures.\n\nIn summary, Hawking Radiation is a quantum effect that causes black holes to emit particles and radiation, leading to a gradual loss of mass and eventual evaporation. The rate of this process depends on the size and temperature of the black hole, with smaller black holes evaporating faster than larger ones."
