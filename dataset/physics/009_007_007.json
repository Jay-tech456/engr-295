    "message_2": "To determine the magnification of the image formed, we first need to find the image distance (v) using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30v)/(20*30) = (20v + 30v)/(20*30)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n30v = 20v + 30v\n10v = 20*30\nv = (20*30)/10\nv = 60 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance (v), we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -60/30\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object."
