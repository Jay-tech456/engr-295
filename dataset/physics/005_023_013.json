    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor experienced by an observer orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole, we can use the following formula:\n\ntime dilation factor = sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, r is the distance from the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is the radius of the event horizon:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass equivalent to 10 times that of the Sun, we can use the solar mass (Ms) to find M:\n\nM = 10 * Ms = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe observer is orbiting at a distance of 10 times the black hole's event horizon, so:\n\nr = 10 * Rs = 10 * 2.95 x 10^4 m = 2.95 x 10^5 m\n\nNow we can find the time dilation factor:\n\ntime dilation factor = sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.95 x 10^5 m * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\ntime dilation factor ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.067)\ntime dilation factor ≈ sqrt(0.933)\ntime dilation factor ≈ 0.966\n\nSo, the time dilation factor experienced by the observer orbiting the black hole at a distance of 10 times the event horizon is approximately 0.966. This means that time passes about 3.4% slower for the observer compared to an observer far away from the black hole."
