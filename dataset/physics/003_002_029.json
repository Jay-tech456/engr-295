    "message_1": "A solenoid has 500 turns and a length of 30 cm. The radius of the winding is 2 cm. Find the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid when a current of 2 A flows through it.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of the solenoid\n\nn = 500 turns / 0.3 m = 1666.67 turns/m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (1666.67 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ Tm/A) * (3333.33 turns/m)\n\nB ≈ 4.186 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 4.186 × 10⁻³ T (Tesla)."
