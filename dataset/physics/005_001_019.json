    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a speed of 0.8c relative to Earth. If the proper time on the spaceship is measured as 100 years, what is the time elapsed on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = Δτ / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere Δt is the time elapsed on Earth (also called the dilated time), Δτ is the proper time (time elapsed on the spaceship), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nΔτ = 100 years\nv = 0.8c\n\nWe can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔt = 100 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nΔt = 100 / √(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt = 100 / √(0.36)\n\nΔt = 100 / 0.6\n\nΔt ≈ 166.67 years\n\nSo, the time elapsed on Earth is approximately 166.67 years."
