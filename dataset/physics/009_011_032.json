    "message_2": "To determine the radius of curvature of the lens, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. Since the lens is converging, one surface will be convex and the other will be concave. For simplicity, we can assume that the lens is symmetric, meaning that the radii of curvature of both surfaces have the same magnitude but opposite signs. In this case, R1 = R and R2 = -R.\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for R:\n\n(1/30 cm) = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R - 1/(-R))\n\n(1/30 cm) = 0.5 * (2/R)\n\nR = 2 * 30 cm / 0.5\n\nR = 60 cm\n\nSo the radius of curvature of the lens is 60 cm."
