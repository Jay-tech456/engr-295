    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the ionization energy, Z is the atomic number (1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (1 for the ground state).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, so we need the positive value of the energy:\n\nIonization energy = 13.6 eV"
