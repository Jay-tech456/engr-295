    "message_2": "To find the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI_transmitted = I_initial * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_initial is the initial intensity of the unpolarized light, theta is the angle between the polarizer's axis and the plane of polarization of the incident light, and I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light.\n\nHowever, since the incident light is unpolarized, we need to take into account that only half of the intensity will pass through the polarizer. Therefore, the initial intensity to be considered for Malus' Law will be half of the given initial intensity:\n\nI_initial_polarized = 0.5 * I_initial\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into Malus' Law:\n\ntheta = 60 degrees = (pi/3) radians (conversion to radians)\nI_initial = 90 W/m^2\n\nI_initial_polarized = 0.5 * 90 W/m^2 = 45 W/m^2\n\nI_transmitted = 45 W/m^2 * cos^2(pi/3)\n\nI_transmitted = 45 W/m^2 * (1/2)^2\n\nI_transmitted = 45 W/m^2 * 1/4\n\nI_transmitted = 11.25 W/m^2\n\nSo, the intensity of light transmitted through the polarizer is 11.25 W/m^2."
