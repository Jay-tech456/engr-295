    "message_2": "According to the current understanding of cosmology, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old. This estimation is based on the Lambda-CDM model, which is the most widely accepted model of the universe's evolution. The model takes into account the principles of special relativity, general relativity, and the observed expansion of the universe, as well as the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang.\n\nThe age of the universe is determined by measuring the Hubble constant (the rate of expansion of the universe) and other cosmological parameters, such as the density of matter and dark energy in the universe. The most distant galaxies observed are moving away from us at speeds close to the speed of light due to the expansion of the universe, but this does not affect the age estimation significantly, as the age is primarily determined by the overall expansion rate and the cosmological parameters."
