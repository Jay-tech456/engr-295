    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) is a constant value that represents the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. The exact value of the Bohr radius is:\n\na0 = 5.29177210903 x 10^-11 meters\n\nHowever, you mentioned a hydrogen atom with a radius of 2.5 x 10^-11 meters, which is smaller than the Bohr radius. This could be a hydrogen atom in an excited state or under specific conditions, but it's important to note that the Bohr radius is a constant value and does not change based on the given radius of the hydrogen atom."
