    "message_2": "In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the running coupling constant, usually denoted as α_s(Q^2), changes as the energy scale (Q^2) changes. This behavior is due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom, which states that the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes weaker at higher energy scales (shorter distances) and stronger at lower energy scales (longer distances).\n\nThe change in the running coupling constant can be described by the renormalization group equation, which is derived using perturbation theory within Quantum Field Theory. The equation is given by:\n\ndα_s(Q^2) / d(log Q^2) = β(α_s),\n\nwhere β(α_s) is the beta function, which depends on the coupling constant α_s itself. The beta function can be calculated using perturbation theory, and its leading-order term is given by:\n\nβ(α_s) = -b * α_s^2,\n\nwhere b is a positive constant that depends on the number of quark flavors and the gauge group of the theory (for QCD, b = (11 * N_c - 2 * N_f) / (12 * π), with N_c = 3 for the number of colors and N_f for the number of quark flavors).\n\nBy solving the renormalization group equation, one can obtain the running coupling constant as a function of the energy scale:\n\nα_s(Q^2) = α_s(Q^2_0) / (1 + (α_s(Q^2_0) * b * log(Q^2 / Q^2_0))),\n\nwhere α_s(Q^2_0) is the coupling constant at a reference energy scale Q^2_0.\n\nIn practice, higher-order terms in the beta function are also considered to improve the accuracy of the calculation. These terms can be computed using higher-order perturbation theory, and they introduce additional dependence on the coupling constant. However, the general behavior of the running coupling constant, with its decrease at higher energy scales and increase at lower energy scales, remains the same."
