    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a square loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a²) / (2 * π * (a² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a is the side length of the square loop, and z is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2 A\na = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nz = 3 cm = 0.03 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * π * ((0.05 m)² + (0.03 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * π * (0.0025 m² + 0.0009 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * π * (0.0034 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (20 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.0034 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB ≈ (20 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.0101\n\nB ≈ 1.98 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 3 cm from the center of the loop on its axis is approximately 1.98 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current flow (clockwise in this case), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field at the point 3 cm from the center of the loop on its axis is into the plane of the loop."
