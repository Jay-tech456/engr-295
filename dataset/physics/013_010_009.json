    "message_2": "The impact of a planet's distance from its star on its orbit and rotational period can be explained using Kepler's laws of planetary motion and the concept of angular momentum conservation.\n\n1. Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion: This law states that the square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nT² ∝ a³\n\nFor a planet orbiting a star, the constant of proportionality is given by:\n\n(4π²/GM) * a³ = T²\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, and a is the distance between the planet and the star.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that as the distance (a) between the planet and the star increases, the orbital period (T) also increases. This means that a planet farther from its star will take longer to complete one orbit around the star.\n\n2. Conservation of Angular Momentum: The angular momentum (L) of a planet is given by the product of its mass (m), orbital velocity (v), and distance (r) from the star:\n\nL = mvr\n\nAngular momentum is conserved in the absence of external torques. Therefore, if a planet moves farther from its star, its orbital velocity must decrease to maintain the same angular momentum. This means that a planet farther from its star will have a slower orbital velocity.\n\nNow, let's consider the rotational period of the planet. The rotational period is determined by the planet's angular momentum and its moment of inertia (I). The moment of inertia of a planet can be approximated as:\n\nI = (2/5) * m * R²\n\nwhere R is the radius of the planet.\n\nThe angular momentum of the planet's rotation is given by:\n\nL_rot = I * ω\n\nwhere ω is the angular velocity of the planet.\n\nAssuming that the planet's angular momentum is conserved during its formation, the initial angular momentum (L_i) should be equal to the final angular momentum (L_f):\n\nL_i = L_f\n\nIf a planet forms farther from its star, it will have a larger initial angular momentum due to its larger distance (r). To conserve angular momentum, the planet's final angular velocity (ω) must be smaller, which means that its rotational period will be longer.\n\nIn conclusion, a planet's distance from its star has a significant impact on its orbital and rotational period. A planet farther from its star will have a longer orbital period due to Kepler's Third Law and a longer rotational period due to the conservation of angular momentum."
