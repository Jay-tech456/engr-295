How does the electrical resistivity change as the temperature is varied around Tc? What is the nature of the transition from normal to superconducting state?",
    "message_2": "The YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) compound is a high-temperature superconductor with a critical temperature (Tc) typically around 90-92 K. The exact Tc value can vary depending on the specific sample preparation, oxygen content (x), and the quality of the thin film. For a YBCO thin film obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, the Tc can be expected to be in this range, but the precise value would need to be determined experimentally.\n\nAs the temperature is varied around Tc, the electrical resistivity of the YBCO thin film will exhibit a sharp drop to zero as the material transitions from the normal state to the superconducting state. In the normal state (above Tc), the resistivity will have a finite value, and it will typically decrease with decreasing temperature. When the temperature reaches Tc, the resistivity will drop abruptly to zero, indicating the onset of the superconducting state.\n\nThe transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in YBCO is a second-order phase transition. This means that the transition is continuous, and there is no release or absorption of latent heat. The order parameter, which is the superconducting electron pair density in this case, changes continuously across the transition. The second-order phase transition is characterized by a divergence in the correlation length and susceptibility, as well as the presence of critical fluctuations near Tc. In the case of YBCO, the transition is also accompanied by the formation of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconductivity phenomenon."
