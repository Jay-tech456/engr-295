    "message_2": "Observational evidence supporting the idea that dark matter particles must be electrically neutral comes from various sources, including:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which is believed to be dark matter. If dark matter particles were electrically charged, they would interact with electromagnetic radiation and be visible, which contradicts the observed data.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, known as gravitational lensing, has been observed around galaxy clusters. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible matter in these clusters, indicating the presence of dark matter. If dark matter particles were charged, they would interact with light and other electromagnetic radiation, which would alter the lensing effect and make them detectable.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB show small temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the presence of dark matter. If dark matter particles were charged, they would have interacted with photons in the early universe, leaving a detectable imprint on the CMB that is not observed.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation show that the observed large-scale structure of the universe can only be explained if dark matter is present and does not interact strongly with electromagnetic radiation. If dark matter particles were charged, they would interact with photons and other charged particles, altering the formation and distribution of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n5. Absence of synchrotron radiation: Charged particles moving in magnetic fields emit synchrotron radiation. If dark matter particles were charged, they would emit this radiation when moving through the magnetic fields present in galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, no such excess synchrotron radiation has been observed, supporting the idea that dark matter particles are electrically neutral.\n\nIn summary, the observational evidence from galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, the CMB, large-scale structure formation, and the absence of synchrotron radiation all support the idea that dark matter particles must be electrically neutral."
