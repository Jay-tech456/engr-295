    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured. To determine its value at a specific energy scale, we use the concept of renormalization group equations. The value of αs at the Z boson mass (mZ) is often used as a reference point, where mZ ≈ 91.2 GeV.\n\nThe current world average value of αs(mZ) is approximately 0.1181, according to the Particle Data Group (PDG). To find the value of αs at 91.2 GeV with a precision of 1%, we can calculate the 1% uncertainty:\n\nαs(91.2 GeV) = 0.1181 ± 0.001181\n\nSo, the value of the strong coupling constant αs at the energy scale of 91.2 GeV to a precision of 1% is approximately 0.1181 ± 0.001181."
