    "message_2": "The likelihood of primordial black holes (PBHs) forming from the collapse of large structures like cosmic strings, as opposed to the collapse of massive stars, is still a topic of ongoing research and debate in the field of astrophysics. However, it is generally considered that the formation of PBHs from cosmic strings is a plausible scenario.\n\nCosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that could have formed in the early universe during phase transitions. They are characterized by their immense density and tension, which could lead to the formation of PBHs if they undergo certain processes, such as loop formation and subsequent collapse.\n\nThe impact of PBHs forming from cosmic strings, as opposed to massive stars, would have several implications on their expected distribution and properties:\n\n1. Mass distribution: PBHs formed from cosmic strings could have a wider mass range than those formed from massive stars. Stellar collapse typically leads to black holes with masses between a few and a few tens of solar masses. In contrast, PBHs formed from cosmic strings could have masses ranging from much smaller than a solar mass to potentially thousands of solar masses, depending on the properties of the cosmic strings.\n\n2. Spatial distribution: PBHs formed from cosmic strings could be more uniformly distributed throughout the universe, as cosmic strings are expected to be distributed more homogeneously than massive stars, which tend to form in dense clusters. This could lead to a more isotropic distribution of PBHs.\n\n3. Formation epoch: PBHs formed from cosmic strings would have formed much earlier in the history of the universe, during the radiation-dominated era, while those formed from massive stars would have formed later, during the matter-dominated era. This difference in formation epochs could have implications for the growth of PBHs through accretion and their potential role in the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.\n\n4. Gravitational wave signatures: PBHs formed from cosmic strings could produce distinct gravitational wave signatures compared to those formed from massive stars. The mergers of PBHs formed from cosmic strings could potentially be detected by current and future gravitational wave observatories, providing valuable information about the early universe and the nature of cosmic strings.\n\nIn conclusion, the likelihood of PBHs forming from cosmic strings is still an open question, but it is considered a plausible scenario. If this were the case, it would have significant implications for the mass distribution, spatial distribution, formation epoch, and gravitational wave signatures of PBHs, potentially providing valuable insights into the early universe and the nature of cosmic strings."
