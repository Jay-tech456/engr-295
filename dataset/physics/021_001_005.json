    "message_2": "Stellar black holes and supermassive black holes are two distinct types of black holes that differ in terms of their formation, mass, and evolution. Here, we will discuss the key differences between these two types of black holes using relevant physics concepts and theoretical models.\n\n1. Formation:\n\nStellar black holes are formed as a result of the gravitational collapse of massive stars. When a star with a mass greater than approximately three times the mass of the Sun reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a supernova explosion. If the remaining core mass is greater than the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit (approximately 2-3 solar masses), the core collapses under its own gravity, and a stellar black hole is formed. This process is explained by the General Theory of Relativity and the concept of stellar evolution.\n\nSupermassive black holes, on the other hand, are found at the centers of galaxies and have masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. The exact formation process of supermassive black holes is still a topic of ongoing research, but there are several proposed theories. One such theory is the direct collapse model, which suggests that supermassive black holes are formed from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe. Another theory is the hierarchical merger model, which proposes that supermassive black holes are formed through the merging of smaller black holes and the accretion of mass over time.\n\n2. Mass:\n\nThe mass of a stellar black hole typically ranges from 3 to 20 solar masses, whereas supermassive black holes have masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. This significant difference in mass leads to different physical properties and behaviors for these two types of black holes.\n\n3. Evolution:\n\nStellar black holes can grow in mass by accreting matter from their surroundings or by merging with other black holes. However, their growth is limited due to the Eddington limit, which is the maximum rate at which a black hole can accrete matter without pushing it away due to radiation pressure. As a result, stellar black holes are not expected to grow significantly in mass over their lifetimes.\n\nSupermassive black holes, on the other hand, can grow much larger due to their location at the centers of galaxies, where they have access to large amounts of gas and dust. They can also grow through the merging of smaller black holes. The growth of supermassive black holes is thought to be closely linked to the evolution of their host galaxies, as their accretion processes can influence star formation and the distribution of matter within the galaxy.\n\nIn conclusion, stellar black holes and supermassive black holes differ in terms of their formation, mass, and evolution. Stellar black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars and have relatively small masses, while supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies and have much larger masses. The evolution of these two types of black holes is also distinct, with stellar black holes experiencing limited growth and supermassive black holes playing a significant role in the evolution of their host galaxies."
