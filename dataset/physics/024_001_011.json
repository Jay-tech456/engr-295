    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum is highly sensitive to its initial conditions, which include the initial angles and angular velocities of both pendulum arms. Due to this sensitivity, the double pendulum exhibits chaotic behavior, meaning that small changes in the initial conditions can lead to vastly different trajectories and motions over time.\n\nThe different types of motion that a double pendulum can exhibit include:\n\n1. Regular motion: If the initial conditions are such that the motion remains confined to a small region of the phase space, the double pendulum can exhibit regular, periodic motion. This is often observed when the initial angles and angular velocities are small.\n\n2. Chaotic motion: When the initial conditions are such that the motion is not confined to a small region of the phase space, the double pendulum can exhibit chaotic motion. This is characterized by an unpredictable and seemingly random trajectory, even though the system is deterministic.\n\n3. Partially chaotic motion: In some cases, the motion of the double pendulum can be a mix of regular and chaotic motion, where one pendulum arm exhibits regular motion while the other exhibits chaotic motion.\n\n4. Rotational motion: If the initial conditions are such that the double pendulum gains enough energy, it can exhibit rotational motion, where one or both pendulum arms rotate continuously around their pivot points.\n\n5. Transient motion: The double pendulum can also exhibit transient motion, where it starts with a particular type of motion (e.g., regular or chaotic) and then transitions to another type of motion after some time.\n\nIn summary, the initial conditions play a crucial role in determining the motion of a double pendulum, and the system can exhibit a wide range of motions, from regular and periodic to chaotic and unpredictable. This makes the double pendulum an interesting and challenging system to study in the field of classical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics."
