    "message_1": "What is the strong coupling constant at a specific energy scale (e.g. 1 GeV) to within a certain level of precision (e.g. 2% uncertainty), based on the available experimental data for processes involving the strong interaction?",
    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a parameter that describes the strength of the strong nuclear force in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.\n\nAt an energy scale of 1 GeV, the strong coupling constant αs is not well-defined because this energy scale is below the confinement scale of QCD, where quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons. However, we can provide an estimate of αs at a higher energy scale, such as the Z boson mass (approximately 91.2 GeV).\n\nAt the Z boson mass scale, the Particle Data Group (PDG) provides a value for the strong coupling constant αs(MZ) = 0.1181, with an uncertainty of ±0.0011, which corresponds to an uncertainty of about 0.93%. This value is obtained by combining various experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.\n\nTo obtain the value of αs at a different energy scale, one can use the renormalization group equations of QCD, which describe how the strong coupling constant evolves with energy. However, keep in mind that the value of αs at 1 GeV is not well-defined due to the confinement scale of QCD."
