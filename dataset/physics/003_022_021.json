    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the motor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) produced by a current-carrying wire is proportional to the current (I) and inversely proportional to the distance (r) from the wire.\n\nThe formula for the Biot-Savart Law is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nI = 5 A (current)\ndl = 0.20 m (length of the motor)\nr = 0.10 m (distance from the motor)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A * 0.20 m) / (4 * π * (0.10 m)²)\n\nNotice that the 4π in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nB = (10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A * 0.20 m) / (0.10 m)²\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for B:\n\nB = (10⁻⁷ T * 1 m * 5 * 0.20) / (0.01)\n\nB = (10⁻⁷ T * 1 m) * (1)\n\nB = 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the motor is 10⁻⁷ T (tesla)."
