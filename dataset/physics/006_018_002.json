    "message_2": "The Auger effect is a phenomenon in which an electron from an outer shell fills a vacancy in an inner shell, and the energy released in this process is transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. In the case of a sodium (Na) atom with a vacancy in the K-shell, the probability of the Auger effect occurring depends on the competition between the Auger effect and other processes, such as radiative decay (X-ray emission).\n\nThe probability of the Auger effect occurring can be estimated using the Auger yield (Sa), which is the ratio of the number of Auger electrons emitted to the total number of vacancies created in the K-shell. For sodium, the Auger yield is approximately 0.5, meaning that there is a 50% chance of the Auger effect occurring when there is a vacancy in the K-shell.\n\nTo determine the energy and kinetic energy of the emitted electron, we need to consider the energy levels of the sodium atom. Sodium has the following electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹. When a vacancy is created in the K-shell (1s), an electron from the L-shell (2s or 2p) will fill the vacancy, and another electron from the M-shell (3s) will be ejected.\n\nThe energy released in the process can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE = E_initial - E_final\n\nwhere E_initial is the initial energy of the electron in the L-shell, and E_final is the final energy of the electron in the K-shell. For sodium, the energy levels are approximately:\n\nE_K = -34.2 eV (K-shell)\nE_L = -5.1 eV (L-shell)\nE_M = -0.3 eV (M-shell)\n\nWhen an electron from the L-shell fills the vacancy in the K-shell, the energy released is:\n\nE = E_K - E_L = -34.2 eV - (-5.1 eV) = -29.1 eV\n\nThis energy is transferred to the electron in the M-shell, which is then ejected. The kinetic energy of the emitted electron can be calculated as:\n\nKE = E + E_M = -29.1 eV + (-0.3 eV) = -29.4 eV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is approximately 29.4 eV."
