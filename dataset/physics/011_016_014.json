    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility of copper, we can use the Curie-Weiss law, which states that the magnetic susceptibility (χ) is proportional to the temperature (T) and inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature and the Curie temperature (θ). The formula is:\n\nχ = C / (T - θ)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant.\n\nHowever, copper is a paramagnetic material, and its magnetic susceptibility is very weak. For paramagnetic materials, the Curie-Weiss law can be simplified to:\n\nχ = C / T\n\nThe Curie constant (C) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nC = (μ₀ * μ_B^2 * N) / (3 * k_B)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the vacuum permeability (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T), N is the number of atoms per unit volume (8.46 × 10^28 m^-3), and k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10^-23 J/K).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Curie constant (C):\n\nC = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T)^2 * 8.46 × 10^28 m^-3) / (3 * 1.381 × 10^-23 J/K)\nC ≈ 3.29 × 10^-9 m^3K/J\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) at 25°C (298.15 K):\n\nχ = C / T\nχ = 3.29 × 10^-9 m^3K/J / 298.15 K\nχ ≈ 1.10 × 10^-11 m^3/J\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the copper metal sample at 25°C under a magnetic field of 1 Tesla is approximately 1.10 × 10^-11 m^3/J."
