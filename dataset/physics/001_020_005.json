    "message_2": "The Lamb shift is a small energy difference between the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 energy levels of the hydrogen atom, which arises due to the interaction between the electron and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. This effect is described by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the renormalization process.\n\nThe energy shift of an electron in the first excited state (2S1/2) of a hydrogen atom due to the Lamb shift is approximately 1057 MHz, which corresponds to an energy difference of about 4.37 x 10^(-6) eV.\n\nThis value is obtained through complex calculations involving QED and renormalization, which take into account the electron's interaction with the vacuum fluctuations and the finite size of the proton. The Lamb shift is an important experimental confirmation of the predictions of QED and has been measured with high precision in various atomic systems."
