    "message_1": "A light wave of wavelength 500 nm passes through a single slit that has a width of 0.05 mm. What is the angle at which the first minimum occurs on a screen that is located 1.5 meters away from the slit?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the first minimum occurs, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. Let's convert the wavelength and the width of the slit to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m = 5 * 10^(-7) m\nWidth of the slit (a) = 0.05 mm = 0.05 * 10^(-3) m = 5 * 10^(-5) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 5 * 10^(-7)) / (5 * 10^(-5))\nsin(θ) = 10^(-2)\n\nTo find the angle θ, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(10^(-2))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 0.573°\n\nSo, the angle at which the first minimum occurs on the screen is approximately 0.573 degrees."
