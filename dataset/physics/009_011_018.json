    "message_1": "A convex lens has a focal length of 20 cm and a refractive index of 1.5. If the radius of curvature of one of its surfaces is 40 cm, what is the radius of curvature of the other surface?",
    "message_2": "We can use the lensmaker's formula to solve this problem. The lensmaker's formula is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 20 cm), the refractive index (n = 1.5), and the radius of curvature of one surface (R1 = 40 cm). We need to find the radius of curvature of the other surface (R2).\n\nPlugging the given values into the lensmaker's formula:\n\n1/20 = (1.5 - 1)(1/40 - 1/R2).\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n1/20 = 0.5(1/40 - 1/R2).\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 20:\n\n1 = 10(1/40 - 1/R2).\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n1/10 = 1/40 - 1/R2.\n\nNow, add 1/R2 to both sides:\n\n1/R2 = 1/10 + 1/40.\n\nTo add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 40:\n\n1/R2 = 4/40 + 1/40.\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n1/R2 = 5/40.\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find R2:\n\nR2 = 40/5.\n\nFinally, simplify the fraction:\n\nR2 = 8 cm.\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the other surface is 8 cm."
