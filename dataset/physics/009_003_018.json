    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of the prism, we can use Snell's Law. First, let's find the angle of incidence (i) in water. We can use the formula for the angle of deviation (D) in a prism:\n\nD = i - r + A\n\nwhere D is the angle of deviation, i is the angle of incidence, r is the angle of refraction, and A is the angle of the prism. Since the light ray is refracted inside the prism at an angle of 45 degrees with the normal, r = 45 degrees. The angle of the prism A is given as 60 degrees.\n\nThe minimum angle of deviation occurs when the angle of incidence equals the angle of emergence. In this case, the angle of deviation is also minimum, and we can use the formula:\n\nD_min = 2 * (i - r)\n\nSince the angle of deviation is minimum, we can equate the two expressions for D:\n\n2 * (i - 45) = i - 45 + 60\n\nSolving for i, we get:\n\ni = 105 degrees\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the refractive index of the prism (n_p). The refractive index of water (n_w) is approximately 1.33. Snell's Law states:\n\nn_w * sin(i) = n_p * sin(r)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n1.33 * sin(105) = n_p * sin(45)\n\nSolving for n_p, we get:\n\nn_p = (1.33 * sin(105)) / sin(45) â‰ˆ 1.52\n\nTherefore, the refractive index of the prism is approximately 1.52."
