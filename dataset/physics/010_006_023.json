    "message_2": "To find the pressure at the bottom of the container, we can use the formula for hydrostatic pressure:\n\nP = ρgh\n\nwhere P is the pressure, ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the fluid column.\n\nIn this case, the density ρ is 820 kg/m³, the acceleration due to gravity g is approximately 9.81 m/s², and the height of the fluid column h is 1 meter.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = (820 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)(1 m)\n\nP = 8038.2 kg m/s² m²\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m/s² m², the pressure at the bottom of the container is:\n\nP = 8038.2 Pa"
