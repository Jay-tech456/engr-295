    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves from intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses between 100 and 1000 solar masses, we need to consider several factors, including the sensitivity of current gravitational wave detectors, the rate of IMBH mergers, and the distance to these events.\n\n1. Sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors: The current generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are primarily sensitive to binary black hole mergers with masses between a few to a few tens of solar masses. Their sensitivity to IMBH mergers is limited, but they can still detect these events if they are close enough.\n\n2. Rate of IMBH mergers: The rate of IMBH mergers is uncertain, as there have been only a few potential detections of such events so far. However, it is generally believed that the merger rate of IMBHs is lower than that of stellar-mass black holes.\n\n3. Distance to IMBH mergers: Gravitational wave detectors are more sensitive to nearby events. The farther away an event is, the less likely it is to be detected. The distribution of IMBH mergers in the universe is not well known, but we can assume that they are distributed similarly to other black hole mergers.\n\nTaking these factors into account, we can estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves from IMBHs as follows:\n\nP(detection) = P(sensitivity) × P(merger rate) × P(distance)\n\nGiven the uncertainties in the sensitivity, merger rate, and distance distribution, it is difficult to provide an exact probability. However, we can say that the probability of detecting gravitational waves from IMBHs with current detectors is relatively low compared to that of detecting waves from stellar-mass black hole mergers. As the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors improves in the future, the probability of detecting IMBH mergers will increase."
