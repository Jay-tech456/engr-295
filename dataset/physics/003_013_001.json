    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 5 cm = 0.05 m and the current I = 2 A, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 80π × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 80π × 10^(-7) T or 2.51 × 10^(-5) T."
