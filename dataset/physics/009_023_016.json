Given that the intensity of the incident light is 5W/m² and that the polarizer transmits 40% of the light incident upon it.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the direction of polarization of the incoming light and the axis of the polarizer. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and θ is the angle between the direction of polarization of the incoming light and the axis of the polarizer.\n\nGiven the intensity of the incident light (I_incident) is 5 W/m² and the angle (θ) is 60 degrees, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light before considering the polarizer's transmission percentage:\n\nI_transmitted = 5 * cos²(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 0.5, we have:\n\nI_transmitted = 5 * (0.5)² = 5 * 0.25 = 1.25 W/m²\n\nNow, we need to consider the polarizer's transmission percentage, which is 40%. To find the final intensity of the transmitted light, we multiply the intensity calculated above by the transmission percentage:\n\nI_final = I_transmitted * transmission_percentage\nI_final = 1.25 * 0.4 = 0.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the polarized light passing through the polarizer is 0.5 W/m²."
