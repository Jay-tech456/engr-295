    "message_1": "A barium sulfate crystal has a magnetic susceptibility of 4.8 x 10^-5 emu/mol. Calculate the magnetic moment per unit cell of the crystal if each unit cell contains one barium and one sulfate ion. Assume that the contribution of each ion to the magnetic moment is equal and independent.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment per unit cell, we can use the formula:\n\nMagnetic moment (μ) = (Magnetic susceptibility (χ) × Avogadro's number (N_A) × Bohr magneton (μ_B)) / (2 × number of ions per unit cell)\n\nHere, the magnetic susceptibility (χ) is given as 4.8 x 10^-5 emu/mol. Avogadro's number (N_A) is 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1, and the Bohr magneton (μ_B) is 9.274 x 10^-24 emu. The number of ions per unit cell is 2 (one barium and one sulfate ion).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = (4.8 x 10^-5 emu/mol × 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1 × 9.274 x 10^-24 emu) / (2 × 2)\n\nμ = (2.775 x 10^-4 emu) / 4\n\nμ = 6.9375 x 10^-5 emu\n\nSo, the magnetic moment per unit cell of the barium sulfate crystal is approximately 6.9375 x 10^-5 emu."
