    "message_2": "The radius of the event horizon of a black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 3 solar masses, we first need to convert this to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole in kilograms is:\n\nM = 3 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (1.333 x 10^-10 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.967 x 10^30 kg) / 8.988 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nr_s ≈ 7.958 x 10^20 m^2 / 8.988 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nr_s ≈ 8.86 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for a relativistic black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8.86 kilometers."
