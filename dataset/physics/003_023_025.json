    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 meters from the generator, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength (B) of a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the generator has 500 turns and a diameter of 0.5 meters, we can assume its length is also 0.5 meters (assuming the generator is a tightly wound solenoid). Therefore, the number of turns per unit length is:\n\nn = total turns / length\nn = 500 turns / 0.5 meters\nn = 1000 turns/meter\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength (B) inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns/meter) * (10 A)\nB = 12.566 × 10^(-4) T\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-2) T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid. To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 meters from the generator, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength (B') of a solenoid at a distance (x) along its axis:\n\nB' = (B / 2) * (1 / (1 + (x / R)^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the solenoid (0.25 meters in this case).\n\nB' = (1.2566 × 10^(-2) T / 2) * (1 / (1 + (2 / 0.25)^2)^(3/2))\nB' ≈ (6.283 × 10^(-3) T) * (1 / (1 + 64)^(3/2))\nB' ≈ (6.283 × 10^(-3) T) * (1 / 65^(3/2))\nB' ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-3) T * 0.00244\nB' ≈ 1.53 × 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 meters from the generator is approximately 1.53 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
