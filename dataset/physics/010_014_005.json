    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and Mach 2.5. Suddenly, the aircraft encounters a shock wave. If the ambient temperature is 280 K and the air density is 0.38 kg/m³, what is the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the normal shock wave relations for a compressible flow. The governing equations are:\n\n1. The Mach number relation:\nM2 = (M1^2 + 2) / (2 * γ * M1^2 - γ + 1)\n\n2. The pressure ratio:\nP2 / P1 = 1 + (2 * γ * (M1^2 - 1)) / (γ + 1)\n\n3. The temperature ratio:\nT2 / T1 = P2 / P1 * ρ1 / ρ2\n\nWhere:\nM1 = Mach number before the shock wave (2.5)\nM2 = Mach number after the shock wave\nγ = specific heat ratio for air (1.4)\nP1 = pressure before the shock wave\nP2 = pressure after the shock wave\nT1 = temperature before the shock wave (280 K)\nT2 = temperature after the shock wave\nρ1 = air density before the shock wave (0.38 kg/m³)\nρ2 = air density after the shock wave\n\nFirst, we need to find the Mach number after the shock wave (M2) using the Mach number relation:\n\nM2 = (2.5^2 + 2) / (2 * 1.4 * 2.5^2 - 1.4 + 1)\nM2 ≈ 0.577\n\nNext, we need to find the pressure ratio (P2 / P1). We can use the pressure ratio equation:\n\nP2 / P1 = 1 + (2 * 1.4 * (2.5^2 - 1)) / (1.4 + 1)\nP2 / P1 ≈ 7.45\n\nNow, we need to find the air density after the shock wave (ρ2). We can use the equation:\n\nρ2 = ρ1 * (γ + 1) * M1^2 / ((γ - 1) * M1^2 + 2)\nρ2 = 0.38 * (1.4 + 1) * 2.5^2 / ((1.4 - 1) * 2.5^2 + 2)\nρ2 ≈ 1.238 kg/m³\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature after the shock wave (T2) using the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT2 / T1 = P2 / P1 * ρ1 / ρ2\nT2 = 280 * 7.45 * 0.38 / 1.238\nT2 ≈ 565.8 K\n\nSo, the temperature behind the shock wave is approximately 565.8 K.\n\nTo find the pressure behind the shock wave (P2), we need to use the ideal gas law:\n\nP1 = ρ1 * R * T1\nP2 = P1 * (P2 / P1)\n\nWhere R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg·K).\n\nP1 = 0.38 * 287 * 280\nP1 ≈ 30562.8 Pa\n\nP2 = 30562.8 * 7.45\nP2 ≈ 227692.46 Pa\n\nSo, the pressure behind the shock wave is approximately 227,692.46 Pa."
