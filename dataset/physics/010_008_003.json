    "message_2": "To calculate the buoyant force, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the object:\nmass = volume × density\nmass = 500 cm³ × 0.8 g/cm³ = 400 g\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass to kg:\nmass = 400 g × (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.4 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the object:\nweight = mass × acceleration due to gravity\nweight = 0.4 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 3.924 N\n\nSince the object is fully immersed in water, the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the object, which is 500 cm³. Now, we need to find the mass of the water displaced:\nmass_water = volume × density_water\nmass_water = 500 cm³ × 1 g/cm³ = 500 g\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass of water to kg:\nmass_water = 500 g × (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.5 kg\n\nFinally, we can calculate the buoyant force:\nbuoyant force = mass_water × acceleration due to gravity\nbuoyant force = 0.5 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 4.905 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the object when it is fully immersed in water is 4.905 N."
