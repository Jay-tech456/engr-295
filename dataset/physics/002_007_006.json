    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the heat capacity of a substance that is heated from a temperature of 25°C to 75°C, given that the substance initially had a mass of 100 grams and absorbs 500 joules of heat energy. What is the heat capacity of the substance?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat capacity of the substance, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nQ = 500 J\nm = 100 g\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C = 50°C\n\nWe need to solve for the heat capacity, c. Rearranging the formula, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 500 J / (100 g × 50°C)\n\nc = 500 J / 5000 g°C\n\nc = 0.1 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the substance is 0.1 J/g°C."
