    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): f = (c^3 / G * M) * (5 / 256 * t)^(-3/8)\n\n2. Amplitude (A): A = (4 * G * M * c^(-1) * r^(-1)) * (5 * G * M * c^(-3) * t)^(-1/4)\n\nHere, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system, r is the distance to the system, and t is the time until the merger.\n\nGiven the total mass of 2.9 solar masses and a distance of 130 million light-years, we can convert these values to SI units:\n\nM = 2.9 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg = 5.7671 * 10^30 kg\nr = 130 * 9.461 * 10^21 m = 1.22993 * 10^25 m\n\nThe GW170817 event was detected by LIGO on August 17, 2017, and the merger time was estimated to be about 100 seconds before the detection. So, we can use t = 100 s in our calculations.\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency and amplitude using the formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): f = (3 * 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.7671 * 10^30 kg) * (5 / 256 * 100 s)^(-3/8) ≈ 151.5 Hz\n\n2. Amplitude (A): A = (4 * 6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.7671 * 10^30 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^(-1) * (1.22993 * 10^25 m)^(-1)) * (5 * 6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.7671 * 10^30 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^(-3) * 100 s)^(-1/4) ≈ 1.16 * 10^(-22)\n\nSo, the calculated frequency of the gravitational waves is approximately 151.5 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.16 * 10^(-22)."
