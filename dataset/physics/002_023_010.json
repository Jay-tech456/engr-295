    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- T1 = 25°C = 298.15 K (converting to Kelvin)\n- T2 = 50°C = 323.15 K (converting to Kelvin)\n- ΔHvap for water ≈ 40.7 kJ/mol\n- R = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nWe need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (P1) to use in the equation. The vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3.17 kPa.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/3.17) = -(40,700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol*K)) * (1/323.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2/3.17) ≈ 3.252\nP2/3.17 = e^3.252\nP2 ≈ 3.17 * e^3.252\nP2 ≈ 12.34 kPa\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 12.34 kPa."
