    "message_2": "The expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the coalescence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can be estimated using general relativity and some basic assumptions about the properties of these black holes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the mass of the primordial black holes. The mass of a PBH can vary widely, but for the sake of this discussion, let's assume they have a mass in the range of 1 to 100 solar masses (M☉). The mass of the black holes will influence the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nAccording to general relativity, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted during the final stages of a black hole merger (the inspiral phase) can be approximated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96)^(3/8) * (π * M_chirp)^(-5/8)\n\nwhere:\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational waves\n- c is the speed of light\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system, which is a combination of the masses of the two merging black holes (M1 and M2): M_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nFor a pair of primordial black holes with masses in the range of 1 to 100 M☉, the chirp mass can vary between ~0.87 M☉ (for two 1 M☉ black holes) and ~65.4 M☉ (for two 100 M☉ black holes).\n\nPlugging these values into the frequency formula, we find that the expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the coalescence of primordial black holes in the early universe is approximately:\n\n- For the lower mass range (1 M☉): f ≈ 1.5 kHz\n- For the upper mass range (100 M☉): f ≈ 20 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the coalescence of primordial black holes in the early universe according to general relativity is roughly between 20 Hz and 1.5 kHz. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency range could be different depending on the specific properties of the primordial black holes and the details of their mergers."
