    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a neutron star can attain is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is approximately 2 to 2.5 solar masses (Mâ˜‰), depending on the equation of state for neutron star matter. This limit is derived from the balance between the inward gravitational force and the outward pressure force due to neutron degeneracy and strong nuclear forces.\n\nIf a neutron star exceeds this mass limit, the gravitational force becomes too strong for the pressure forces to counteract, causing the neutron star to collapse. This collapse leads to the formation of a black hole, an object with such strong gravity that not even light can escape its event horizon.\n\nThe relation between neutron stars and black holes lies in their formation process. Both are remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. If the core remnant of the explosion is below the TOV limit, it forms a neutron star. However, if the core remnant exceeds the TOV limit, it collapses further and forms a black hole."
