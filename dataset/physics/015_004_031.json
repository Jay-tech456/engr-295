    "message_2": "To estimate the energy released by gravitational waves during a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (c^5/G) * (k * M * R^2) / (5 * d^2)\n\nwhere:\nE is the energy released by gravitational waves,\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s),\nG is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nk is a dimensionless constant of order unity (we will assume k = 1 for simplicity),\nM is the mass of the star (20 solar masses),\nR is the distance from the star to Earth (10 megaparsecs),\nand d is the distance the gravitational wave travels before reaching Earth (also 10 megaparsecs).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star and the distance to Earth into SI units.\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\n1 parsec = 3.086 x 10^16 m\n10 megaparsecs = 10 * 10^6 * 3.086 x 10^16 m = 3.086 x 10^23 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (c^5/G) * (k * M * R^2) / (5 * d^2)\nE = ((3 x 10^8 m/s)^5 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)) * (1 * 3.978 x 10^31 kg * (3.086 x 10^23 m)^2) / (5 * (3.086 x 10^23 m)^2)\nE ≈ (8.64 x 10^52 kg m^2 s^-3) * (3.978 x 10^31 kg) / 5\nE ≈ 3.44 x 10^84 kg m^2 s^-3 / 5\nE ≈ 6.88 x 10^83 kg m^2 s^-3\n\nThe estimated energy released by gravitational waves during a supernova explosion of a star with a mass of 20 solar masses at a distance of 10 megaparsecs from Earth is approximately 6.88 x 10^83 kg m^2 s^-3 (joules). Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, as the actual energy released can vary depending on the specific properties of the star and the supernova explosion."
