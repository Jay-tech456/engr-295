    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 35 grams of methane, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane and the standard enthalpy of combustion for methane.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of combustion for methane (ΔHc°) is -890.3 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of methane (35 grams) to moles using the molar mass of methane (16.04 g/mol):\n\nmoles of CH₄ = mass / molar mass\nmoles of CH₄ = 35 g / 16.04 g/mol\nmoles of CH₄ ≈ 2.18 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 35 grams of methane using the standard enthalpy of combustion:\n\nΔH = moles of CH₄ × ΔHc°\nΔH = 2.18 mol × -890.3 kJ/mol\nΔH ≈ -1941.65 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of 35 grams of methane is approximately -1941.65 kJ."
