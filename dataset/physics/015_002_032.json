    "message_2": "To determine the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the total mass of the system (in this case, 2.7 times the mass of the sun), and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the neutron star system to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the combined mass of the neutron star system is:\n\nM = 2.7 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.3703 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.3703 x 10^30 kg * π)\n\nf ≈ 920 Hz\n\nThis frequency corresponds to the peak frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger. However, the frequency range of the emitted gravitational waves will span from lower frequencies during the inspiral phase to higher frequencies during the merger and ringdown phases.\n\nTo estimate the frequency range, we can consider that the frequency will roughly double during the inspiral phase and increase by a factor of 3 during the merger and ringdown phases. Therefore, the frequency range of the gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger can be estimated as:\n\nLower frequency: f / 2 ≈ 460 Hz\nUpper frequency: 3 * f ≈ 2760 Hz\n\nSo, the estimated frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger is approximately 460 Hz to 2760 Hz."
