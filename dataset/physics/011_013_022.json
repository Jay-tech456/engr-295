    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find the resistance of the wire and then use the formula for conductivity. \n\nThe resistance of a wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = ρ * (L / A)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, ρ is the resistivity, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire.\n\nGiven the diameter of the wire (d) is 2mm, we can find the radius (r) as:\n\nr = d / 2 = 2mm / 2 = 1mm = 0.001m\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * r² = π * (0.001m)² = 3.14159 * 0.000001m² ≈ 3.14 x 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance (R) of the wire:\n\nR = ρ * (L / A) = (1.68 x 10⁻⁸ Ωm) * (10m / 3.14 x 10⁻⁶ m²) ≈ 5.35 x 10⁻³ Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 x 10⁻⁸ Ωm) ≈ 5.95 x 10⁷ S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire at 25°C is approximately 5.95 x 10⁷ S/m."
