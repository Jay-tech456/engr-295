    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Since the black hole has a mass 3 times that of the sun, its mass would be:\n\nM = 3 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 * 5.967 x 10^30) / (8.98755179 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (7.977 x 10^20) / (8.98755179 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 8.881 x 10^3 meters\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass 3 times that of the sun is approximately 8,881 meters or 8.881 kilometers."
