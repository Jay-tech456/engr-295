    "message_1": "A Carnot engine operates between a heat reservoir at 433 K and a sink at 273 K. If the engine receives 900 J of heat energy from the reservoir, what is the maximum amount of useful work that can be obtained from the engine? Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine as well.",
    "message_2": "The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir (sink) and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 273 K and T_hot = 433 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (273 / 433)\nEfficiency ≈ 0.369\n\nThe Carnot efficiency of the engine is approximately 36.9%.\n\nNow, to find the maximum amount of useful work that can be obtained from the engine, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Efficiency × Heat_energy_received\n\nWork = 0.369 × 900 J\nWork ≈ 332.1 J\n\nThe maximum amount of useful work that can be obtained from the engine is approximately 332.1 Joules."
