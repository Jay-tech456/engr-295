    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the material, we can use the formula:\n\nχ = M / (H * V)\n\nwhere M is the magnetic moment (4.8 Am²), H is the magnetic field (3.2 T), and V is the volume of the material. \n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the material. To do this, we need to know the density (ρ) of the material. Unfortunately, the density is not provided in the problem. However, we can still express the volume in terms of density:\n\nV = mass / ρ = 2.5 g / ρ\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for the volume into the magnetic susceptibility formula:\n\nχ = M / (H * V) = 4.8 Am² / (3.2 T * (2.5 g / ρ))\n\nχ = (4.8 Am² * ρ) / (3.2 T * 2.5 g)\n\nWithout knowing the density of the material, we cannot provide a numerical value for the magnetic susceptibility. However, we can express it in terms of the unknown density:\n\nχ = (1.5 Am²/g * ρ) / T"
