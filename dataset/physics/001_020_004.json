    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I am unable to perform complex calculations directly. However, I can guide you through the process of solving this problem.\n\nIn quantum electrodynamics (QED), perturbation theory is used to approximate the solutions to the equations of motion for interacting particles, such as electrons and photons. The third order of perturbation theory involves calculating the corrections to the electron charge, mass, and photon mass due to their interactions with each other.\n\n1. Renormalization:\nIn QED, the bare electron charge, mass, and photon mass are infinite due to the presence of ultraviolet divergences. Renormalization is a technique used to remove these infinities by introducing counterterms that cancel out the divergences, resulting in finite, measurable quantities.\n\n2. Electron charge renormalization:\nThe electron charge renormalization can be calculated using the vertex function, which describes the interaction between an electron and a photon. At the third order of perturbation theory, you need to consider one-loop and two-loop Feynman diagrams. The renormalized electron charge (e) can be expressed as:\n\ne = e_bare + δe\n\nwhere e_bare is the bare electron charge and δe is the counterterm that cancels out the divergence.\n\n3. Electron mass renormalization:\nThe electron mass renormalization can be calculated using the electron self-energy, which describes the interaction of an electron with a virtual photon. At the third order of perturbation theory, you need to consider one-loop and two-loop Feynman diagrams. The renormalized electron mass (m) can be expressed as:\n\nm = m_bare + δm\n\nwhere m_bare is the bare electron mass and δm is the counterterm that cancels out the divergence.\n\n4. Photon mass renormalization:\nIn QED, the photon is a massless particle. However, at higher orders of perturbation theory, the photon can acquire an effective mass due to its interaction with virtual electron-positron pairs. This effective mass is called the photon mass renormalization (m_photon). At the third order of perturbation theory, you need to consider one-loop and two-loop Feynman diagrams.\n\nTo calculate the first corrections to the electron charge, mass, and photon mass at the third order of perturbation theory, you need to evaluate the relevant Feynman diagrams and apply the renormalization conditions. This involves performing complex integrals and algebraic manipulations, which are beyond the scope of this response. However, I hope this overview helps you understand the process and the concepts involved in solving this problem."
