Then, explain the significance of the obtained value in the context of energy transfer in living systems.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard free energy change for the hydrolysis of ATP at 37°C, we can use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG° is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310.15 K), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nThe reaction for the hydrolysis of ATP is:\n\nATP + H2O → ADP + Pi\n\nThe standard free energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction is -30.5 kJ/mol. Since the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi are all 1 mM, the reaction quotient (Q) is:\n\nQ = ([ADP][Pi])/([ATP][H2O])\n\nAssuming the concentration of water is constant and much higher than the other concentrations, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nQ = [ADP][Pi]/[ATP]\n\nSince all concentrations are 1 mM, Q = 1. Now we can plug the values into the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG = -30.5 kJ/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(310.15 K) ln(1)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔG = -30.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard free energy change for the hydrolysis of ATP at 37°C is -30.5 kJ/mol.\n\nThe significance of this value in the context of energy transfer in living systems is that the hydrolysis of ATP releases a considerable amount of energy that can be used to drive various cellular processes, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and biosynthesis. The negative value of ΔG indicates that the reaction is spontaneous and exergonic, meaning it releases energy. This energy release is essential for maintaining the energy balance in living organisms and ensuring that energy-demanding processes can occur."
