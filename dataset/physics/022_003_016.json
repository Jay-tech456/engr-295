    "message_2": "The distribution of visible matter and dark matter in galaxies plays a crucial role in understanding the observed rotation curves of galaxies. Visible matter, also known as baryonic matter, includes stars, gas, and dust, while dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes.\n\nIn spiral galaxies, visible matter is primarily concentrated in the central bulge and the spiral arms. The distribution of dark matter, on the other hand, is not well understood due to its elusive nature. However, based on observations and simulations, it is believed that dark matter is distributed in a roughly spherical halo surrounding the galaxy, with the density decreasing as we move away from the center.\n\nThe rotation curve of a galaxy is a plot of the orbital velocities of stars and gas as a function of their distance from the galactic center. According to classical Newtonian mechanics, we would expect the rotation curve to follow a Keplerian decline, meaning that the orbital velocity should decrease as we move away from the center of the galaxy. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible matter should decrease with distance, leading to lower orbital velocities.\n\nHowever, observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies have shown that the orbital velocities remain roughly constant or even slightly increase with distance from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected Keplerian decline is known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nThe presence of dark matter provides a solution to this problem. The gravitational influence of the dark matter halo, which extends far beyond the visible matter, can account for the observed flat or increasing rotation curves. The additional mass provided by the dark matter increases the gravitational force acting on the stars and gas at larger distances from the galactic center, resulting in higher orbital velocities than would be expected based solely on the visible matter.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of visible matter and dark matter in galaxies affects the rotation curve by providing additional gravitational force that keeps the orbital velocities of stars and gas relatively constant or slightly increasing with distance from the galactic center. This observation supports the existence of dark matter and its significant role in shaping the dynamics of galaxies."
