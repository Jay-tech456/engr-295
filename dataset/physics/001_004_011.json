    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n=1) to the n=3 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = (-13.6 eV / n_final^2) - (-13.6 eV / n_initial^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E_final is the energy of the final state (n=3), E_initial is the energy of the initial state (n=1), and n_final and n_initial are the principal quantum numbers of the final and initial states, respectively.\n\nPlugging in the values for n_final and n_initial:\n\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 3^2) - (-13.6 eV / 1^2)\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 9) - (-13.6 eV)\nΔE = (-1.51 eV) - (-13.6 eV)\nΔE = 12.09 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state to the n=3 energy level is approximately 12.09 eV."
