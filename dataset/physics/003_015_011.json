    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, we can find the magnetic field due to each side and then sum them up to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The current element dl can be taken along the side, and the position vector r is from the current element to the center of the loop. The angle between dl and r is 45 degrees (since the center of the square forms a 45-45-90 triangle with the sides).\n\nFor one side of the square loop, the magnetic field dB at the center is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(45°)) / r²\n\nIntegrating this expression along the side of the loop (from 0 to a), we get the magnetic field due to one side:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * a * sin(45°)) / r²\n\nSince there are four sides, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * a * sin(45°)) / r²\n\nNow, we need to find the distance r from the center to the midpoint of one side. Using the Pythagorean theorem for a 45-45-90 triangle, we have:\n\nr = a / √2\n\nSubstituting this value of r into the expression for B_total, we get:\n\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * a * sin(45°)) / (a² / 2)\n\nB_total = (2 * μ₀ * I * a * sin(45°)) / (4π * a²)\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * a)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current, and your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. Since the current is flowing in a square loop, the magnetic field at the center will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is:\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * a)\n\nAnd the direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop."
