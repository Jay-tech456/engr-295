    "message_2": "The maximum angle of attack (AoA) that a typical commercial airplane can have before experiencing flow separation and stall varies depending on the specific aircraft and airfoil design. Generally, the critical angle of attack for most commercial airplanes is around 15 to 20 degrees. Beyond this angle, the airflow starts to separate from the wing's upper surface, leading to a rapid loss of lift and the onset of a stall.\n\nAirfoil shape and surface roughness significantly affect the stall angle of attack. Airfoil shape determines the pressure distribution over the wing, which influences the point at which flow separation occurs. Thicker airfoils with more camber (curvature) can generate higher lift at lower angles of attack but may experience flow separation at lower angles compared to thinner, less cambered airfoils. Surface roughness, such as dirt, ice, or imperfections on the wing, can cause the boundary layer to transition from laminar to turbulent flow earlier, leading to earlier flow separation and a reduced stall angle of attack.\n\nPilots can mitigate the effects of flow separation and stall while maneuvering the aircraft at high angles of attack in several ways:\n\n1. Load factor management: By managing the aircraft's load factor (the ratio of lift to the aircraft's weight), pilots can avoid abrupt maneuvers that may lead to high angles of attack and potential stalls.\n\n2. Airspeed control: Maintaining an appropriate airspeed for the given flight conditions helps ensure that the aircraft remains below the critical angle of attack. Pilots should be aware of the stall speed for their aircraft in various configurations (e.g., flaps, landing gear) and avoid flying too slow.\n\n3. Angle of attack awareness: Pilots should be aware of their aircraft's angle of attack and monitor it during flight, especially during high-performance maneuvers or in turbulent conditions.\n\n4. Stall recovery training: Regular stall recovery training helps pilots recognize the onset of a stall and take appropriate actions to recover, such as reducing the angle of attack, increasing power, and leveling the wings.\n\n5. Use of devices: Some aircraft are equipped with devices such as vortex generators, winglets, or slats that can help delay flow separation and increase the stall angle of attack. These devices can improve the aircraft's performance and handling at high angles of attack.\n\nIn summary, the maximum angle of attack before stall depends on the specific aircraft and airfoil design, with airfoil shape and surface roughness playing significant roles. Pilots can mitigate the effects of flow separation and stall by managing load factors, controlling airspeed, maintaining angle of attack awareness, undergoing stall recovery training, and utilizing devices that delay flow separation."
