    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The metric for a Reissner-Nordström black hole is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is the charge, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates.\n\nThe event horizon radius (r+) and the singularity radius (r-) are determined by the roots of the equation:\n\n1 - 2M/r + Q²/r² = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can find the roots:\n\nr± = (2M ± √(4M² - 4Q²))/2 = M ± √(M² - Q²)\n\nSo, the event horizon radius (r+) is:\n\nr+ = M + √(M² - Q²)\n\nand the singularity radius (r-) is:\n\nr- = M - √(M² - Q²)\n\nNow, let's find the area of the event horizon. The area of a sphere in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\nA = ∫∫(r² sinθ) dθ dφ\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire sphere (θ from 0 to π, φ from 0 to 2π). Since the event horizon is a sphere with radius r+, the area of the event horizon is:\n\nA = ∫(0 to 2π) ∫(0 to π) (r+² sinθ) dθ dφ\n\nA = r+² ∫(0 to 2π) dφ ∫(0 to π) sinθ dθ\n\nA = r+² [2π - 0] [-cos(π) + cos(0)]\n\nA = r+² (2π)(2)\n\nA = 4π(r+)²\n\nSubstituting the expression for r+:\n\nA = 4π(M + √(M² - Q²))²\n\nThis is the area of the event horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in terms of its mass M and charge Q."
