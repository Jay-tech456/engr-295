    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nGiven that the initial volume (V1) is 2 L and the final volume (V2) is 4 L, we can find the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V2 - V1 = 4 L - 2 L = 2 L\n\nThe pressure (P) is given as 1 atm. To use the formula, we need to convert the pressure to a consistent unit, such as joules per liter. We know that 1 atm = 101.325 J/L.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV = -(101.325 J/L) * (2 L)\n\nW = -202.65 J\n\nThe work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is -202.65 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas (expanding), not on the gas."
