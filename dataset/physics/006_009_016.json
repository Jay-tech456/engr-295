    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nHowever, we are not given the scattering angle θ. Instead, we are given the binding energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom, which is 13.6 eV. We can use this information to find the maximum change in wavelength, which occurs when the photon transfers all its energy to the electron.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial energy of the X-ray photon:\n\nE_photon_initial = (h * c) / λ\n\nwhere λ is the initial wavelength of the X-ray photon (0.01 nm or 1 x 10^-11 m).\n\nE_photon_initial = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1 x 10^-11 m) = 1.988 x 10^-15 J\n\nNow, we need to convert the binding energy of the electron from eV to Joules:\n\nE_binding = 13.6 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.179 x 10^-18 J\n\nThe maximum energy transfer occurs when the photon transfers all its energy to the electron, except for the binding energy:\n\nE_photon_final = E_photon_initial - E_binding = 1.988 x 10^-15 J - 2.179 x 10^-18 J = 1.966 x 10^-15 J\n\nNow we can find the final wavelength of the X-ray photon:\n\nλ_final = (h * c) / E_photon_final = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.966 x 10^-15 J) = 1.009 x 10^-11 m\n\nFinally, we can find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = λ_final - λ_initial = 1.009 x 10^-11 m - 1 x 10^-11 m = 9 x 10^-14 m\n\nSo, the change in wavelength of the X-ray photon is 9 x 10^-14 m or 0.0009 nm."
