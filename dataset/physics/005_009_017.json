    "message_1": "A train is moving towards a stationary observer with a velocity of 0.8c. The train whistle emits a sound of 500 Hz. If the speed of sound is 340 m/s, what frequency does the observer hear? (Assume the observer is at a point where the distance between the train and observer is decreasing.)",
    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to have a typo. The train's velocity cannot be 0.8c (80% of the speed of light) as it is not physically possible for a train to travel at such a high speed. Assuming the train's velocity is 0.8 times the speed of sound (0.8 * 340 m/s), we can solve the problem using the Doppler effect formula for sound.\n\nThe Doppler effect formula for sound is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (v_sound + v_observer) / (v_sound + v_source)\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the frequency heard by the observer,\nf_source is the frequency emitted by the source (500 Hz),\nv_sound is the speed of sound (340 m/s),\nv_observer is the velocity of the observer (0 m/s, as the observer is stationary), and\nv_source is the velocity of the source (train) relative to the medium (air).\n\nSince the train is moving towards the observer, its velocity is negative:\n\nv_source = -0.8 * 340 m/s = -272 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = 500 Hz * (340 m/s + 0 m/s) / (340 m/s - 272 m/s)\nf_observed = 500 Hz * (340 m/s) / (68 m/s)\nf_observed â‰ˆ 2500 Hz\n\nSo, the observer hears a frequency of approximately 2500 Hz."
