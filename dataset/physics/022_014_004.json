    "message_2": "To determine the minimum mass of primordial black holes (PBHs) that could make up the observed dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the current constraints on their properties. These constraints come from various observations and experiments, such as gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, and gamma-ray bursts.\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: PBHs can act as gravitational lenses, bending the light from distant objects. If PBHs were a significant component of dark matter, we would expect to observe a certain number of gravitational lensing events. Observations of gravitational lensing have placed an upper limit on the abundance of PBHs with masses between 10^-8 and 10^2 solar masses.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: PBHs can affect the CMB radiation through their gravitational influence on the early universe. The CMB power spectrum provides constraints on the abundance of PBHs with masses between 10^-5 and 10^3 solar masses.\n\n3. Gamma-ray bursts: PBHs can evaporate through Hawking radiation, producing gamma-ray bursts. Observations of gamma-ray bursts have placed constraints on the abundance of PBHs with masses below 10^15 grams (about 10^-18 solar masses).\n\nTaking these constraints into account, the minimum mass of primordial black holes that could make up the observed dark matter in the universe would be around 10^-18 solar masses (or 10^15 grams). However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual value could be different depending on the specific model and assumptions used in the calculations."
