    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the decay of an electron into a photon is a forbidden process. This is because the process would violate several conservation laws, such as charge conservation and angular momentum conservation.\n\nElectrons are charged particles with a charge of -1 elementary charge, while photons are neutral particles with no charge. If an electron were to decay into a photon, the total charge before and after the decay would not be conserved, which is not allowed by the conservation of charge.\n\nAdditionally, electrons have a spin of 1/2 (they are fermions), while photons have a spin of 1 (they are bosons). The conservation of angular momentum would also be violated if an electron were to decay into a photon.\n\nTherefore, the decay rate of an electron to a photon in quantum field theory is zero, as this process is not allowed by the fundamental conservation laws."
