    "message_2": "The cosmic web is the large-scale structure of the universe, consisting of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. It is believed to be shaped by the distribution of dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe relationship between the cosmic web and dark matter distribution can be understood through the process of structure formation in the universe. In the early universe, small fluctuations in the density of dark matter led to the formation of dark matter halos. These halos attracted baryonic matter (ordinary matter) through gravity, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe filamentary structure of the cosmic web is a direct result of the distribution of dark matter. Dark matter halos are interconnected by filaments of dark matter, which also contain galaxies and galaxy clusters. These filaments form a cosmic web-like structure that spans the entire universe. Observations of galaxy distributions and large-scale structure surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have provided strong evidence for the existence of this cosmic web.\n\nVoids are large, underdense regions in the cosmic web that contain very few galaxies. They are also a consequence of the dark matter distribution. As dark matter halos and filaments grow through gravitational attraction, they pull matter away from the surrounding regions, creating voids. The distribution of voids in the universe can be used to study the properties of dark matter and test cosmological models.\n\nTheoretical models, such as the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model and its variants, have been successful in explaining the observed properties of the cosmic web. These models use N-body simulations to study the evolution of dark matter distribution and the formation of large-scale structures. The results of these simulations are consistent with the observed properties of the cosmic web, such as the filamentary structure and the distribution of voids.\n\nIn conclusion, the large-scale structure of the cosmic web is closely related to the distribution of dark matter in the universe. The filamentary structure and voids in the cosmic web are a direct consequence of the gravitational effects of dark matter on visible matter. Observational data and theoretical models, such as the CDM model, provide strong evidence for this relationship and help us understand the underlying distribution of dark matter in the universe."
