    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It is essentially the \"point of no return\" for any object that crosses it. The event horizon is related to the mass and radius of the black hole through the Schwarzschild radius, which is the radius of the event horizon.\n\nThe equation for calculating the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe event horizon of a black hole is a sphere with the Schwarzschild radius as its radius. So, once you have calculated the Schwarzschild radius using the equation above, you can determine the event horizon of the black hole."
