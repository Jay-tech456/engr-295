    "message_1": "A polarizer is placed in front of an unpolarized light source, which emits light with the intensity of 100 W/m^2. After passing through the polarizer, the intensity of the light was measured to be 20 W/m^2. What is the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the direction of polarization of the incident light? (Hint: Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light after passing through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the light after passing through the polarizer, I₀ is the initial intensity of the light, and θ is the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the direction of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given I = 20 W/m² and I₀ = 100 W/m². We need to find the angle θ.\n\n20 = 100 * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n0.2 = cos²(θ)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.2) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.4472\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ. We can use the inverse cosine function (cos^(-1)):\n\nθ = cos^(-1)(0.4472)\n\nθ ≈ 63.4°\n\nSo, the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the direction of polarization of the incident light is approximately 63.4°."
