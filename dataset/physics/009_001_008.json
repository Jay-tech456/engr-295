    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), and θ1 = 30 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.3333\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 19.47 degrees.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the deviation of the ray as it passes through the slab. The deviation is the difference between the angle of incidence and the angle of emergence. Since the ray enters and exits the slab at the same angle (due to the parallel sides of the slab), the angle of emergence is also 30 degrees.\n\nDeviation = θ1 - θ2\nDeviation = 30 - 19.47\nDeviation ≈ 10.53 degrees\n\nThe deviation of the ray as it passes through the glass slab is approximately 10.53 degrees."
