    "message_2": "The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detects high-energy gamma rays with energies ranging from 20 MeV (Mega-electron volts) to over 300 GeV (Giga-electron volts). This wide energy range allows the telescope to observe various astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, pulsars, and supernova remnants.\n\nThe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has two main instruments for detecting gamma rays: the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).\n\n1. Large Area Telescope (LAT): The LAT is the primary instrument on the Fermi telescope and is designed to detect gamma rays in the energy range of 20 MeV to over 300 GeV. It uses a technique called pair production to detect gamma rays. When a high-energy gamma-ray photon enters the LAT, it interacts with a heavy metal layer (such as tungsten) and converts into an electron-positron pair. These charged particles then pass through a series of silicon strip detectors, which track their paths. The LAT measures the energy and direction of the incoming gamma-ray photon based on the tracks of the electron-positron pair.\n\n2. Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM): The GBM is a complementary instrument to the LAT and is designed to detect lower-energy gamma rays in the range of 8 keV (kilo-electron volts) to 40 MeV. It consists of 14 scintillation detectors, which are sensitive to gamma rays and produce flashes of light when a gamma-ray photon interacts with the detector material. Photomultiplier tubes convert these light flashes into electrical signals, which are then processed to determine the energy and arrival time of the gamma-ray photons.\n\nTogether, the LAT and GBM provide a comprehensive view of the high-energy gamma-ray sky and help scientists study various astrophysical phenomena."
