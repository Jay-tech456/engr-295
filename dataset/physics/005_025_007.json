    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy of an electron, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nwhere E is the relativistic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron.\n\nGiven that the velocity of the electron is 0.9c, we can plug in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic energy:\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = (2.294)(9.11 x 10^-31 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 1.857 x 10^-14 J\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the electron is approximately 1.857 x 10^-14 Joules."
