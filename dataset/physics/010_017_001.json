    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank filled with water is subjected to an external vibration. The natural frequency of the tank is found to be 20 Hz. Determine the amplitude of the external vibration that will cause resonance to occur in the tank. The height of the tank is 1 meter and the diameter is 0.5 meters. Assume that the tank behaves like a simple spring-mass system with a single degree of freedom.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the external vibration that will cause resonance to occur in the tank, we first need to find the mass of the water in the tank and the spring constant of the system.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the tank:\nThe volume V of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 0.5 m / 2 = 0.25 m\nHeight (h) = 1 m\n\nV = π * (0.25 m)² * 1 m ≈ 0.19635 m³\n\n2. Calculate the mass of the water in the tank:\nThe mass m of the water can be calculated using the formula m = ρV, where ρ is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m³).\n\nm = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.19635 m³ ≈ 196.35 kg\n\n3. Calculate the spring constant of the system:\nThe natural frequency f_n of a spring-mass system can be calculated using the formula f_n = (1 / 2π) * √(k / m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for k, we get:\n\nk = m * (2π * f_n)²\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nk = 196.35 kg * (2π * 20 Hz)² ≈ 7.74 * 10^4 N/m\n\n4. Determine the amplitude of the external vibration that will cause resonance:\nIn a simple spring-mass system with a single degree of freedom, resonance occurs when the frequency of the external vibration matches the natural frequency of the system. In this case, the natural frequency is given as 20 Hz.\n\nThe amplitude of the external vibration at resonance depends on the damping in the system. However, since the problem does not provide any information about the damping, we cannot determine the amplitude of the external vibration that will cause resonance.\n\nIf the damping is known, the amplitude of the external vibration at resonance can be calculated using the formula A = F_0 / (k - m * ω²), where A is the amplitude, F_0 is the amplitude of the external force, k is the spring constant, m is the mass, and ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2π * f_n)."
