    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor with a radius of 0.5 cm and an outer conductor with a radius of 1 cm. The inner conductor carries a current of 5 A in the positive z-direction. Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 2 cm from the axis of the cable. Assume that the magnetic permeability of the medium surrounding the cable is the same as that of free space.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 2 cm from the axis of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field inside the outer conductor (between 1 cm and 2 cm from the axis). Since the point is outside the inner conductor, the total current enclosed by the loop is the current in the inner conductor, which is 5 A.\n\nLet's consider a circular loop of radius r (2 cm) centered at the axis of the cable. The magnetic field will be tangential to the loop at every point, so the dot product B⋅dl will simply be B*dl. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n∮Bdl = B * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * 5 A\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB * 2π(0.02 m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 5 A\n\nB * 0.04π m = 20π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) T) / (0.04π m)\n\nB = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 2 cm from the axis of the cable is 5 × 10^(-6) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be found using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (positive z-direction), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in the azimuthal direction, circling around the cable.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 2 cm from the axis of the cable is 5 × 10^(-6) T, and the direction is azimuthal, circling around the cable."
