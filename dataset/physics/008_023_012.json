    "message_2": "In electron-proton collisions, W and Z bosons are produced through the process of deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The differential cross-sections of W and Z boson production depend on the momentum transfer (Q^2) and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding particles.\n\nThe differential cross-section for W and Z boson production can be expressed as:\n\ndσ/dQ^2 = (1/π) * (α^2 / Q^4) * F(W, Z)\n\nHere, α is the electromagnetic coupling constant, Q^2 is the momentum transfer, and F(W, Z) is the structure function for W and Z boson production, which depends on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding particles.\n\nThe structure function F(W, Z) can be further expressed as a convolution of the PDFs of the colliding particles and the partonic cross-sections for W and Z boson production:\n\nF(W, Z) = ∑_i ∫_0^1 dx * f_i(x, Q^2) * σ_i(x, Q^2)\n\nHere, the sum runs over all parton flavors i, x is the momentum fraction carried by the parton, f_i(x, Q^2) is the PDF of the parton i, and σ_i(x, Q^2) is the partonic cross-section for W and Z boson production.\n\nAs the momentum transfer Q^2 increases, the PDFs of the colliding particles evolve according to the DGLAP (Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) equations. In general, the PDFs decrease as Q^2 increases, which leads to a decrease in the differential cross-sections of W and Z boson production.\n\nHowever, the behavior of the differential cross-sections with varying Q^2 is not straightforward and depends on the specific kinematic region and the parton flavors involved. For example, at low Q^2, the cross-sections are dominated by the exchange of virtual photons, while at high Q^2, the cross-sections are sensitive to the weak boson exchange and the electroweak mixing angle.\n\nIn summary, the differential cross-sections of W and Z boson production in electron-proton collisions depend on the momentum transfer Q^2 and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding particles. As Q^2 increases, the PDFs generally decrease, leading to a decrease in the differential cross-sections. However, the specific behavior depends on the kinematic region and the parton flavors involved."
