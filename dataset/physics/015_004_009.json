    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (c^5/G) * (dE/dt)\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and dE/dt is the rate of change of energy.\n\nThe rate of change of energy can be estimated using the quadrupole formula:\n\ndE/dt = (G/5c^5) * (d^3I/dt^3)^2\n\nwhere dI is the change in the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution.\n\nFor a supernova explosion, the quadrupole moment can be approximated as:\n\nI ~ M * R^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the supernova and R is its radius. The mass of the supernova is given as 20 solar masses, so we can convert that to kilograms:\n\nM = 20 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe radius of the supernova can be estimated using the distance and duration of the explosion. The distance is given as 10 kiloparsecs, which can be converted to meters:\n\nD = 10 kpc * (3.086 x 10^19 m/kpc) = 3.086 x 10^20 m\n\nAssuming the explosion expands at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can estimate the radius using the duration of the explosion:\n\nR ~ c * t = (3 x 10^8 m/s) * (0.1 s) = 3 x 10^7 m\n\nNow we can estimate the change in the quadrupole moment:\n\ndI ~ M * R^2 = (3.978 x 10^31 kg) * (3 x 10^7 m)^2 = 3.58 x 10^46 kg m^2\n\nAssuming the change in the quadrupole moment occurs over the duration of the explosion, we can estimate the third time derivative:\n\nd^3I/dt^3 ~ dI/t^3 = (3.58 x 10^46 kg m^2) / (0.1 s)^3 = 3.58 x 10^49 kg m^2/s^3\n\nNow we can estimate the rate of change of energy:\n\ndE/dt = (G/5c^5) * (d^3I/dt^3)^2 = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 / 5(3 x 10^8 m/s)^5) * (3.58 x 10^49 kg m^2/s^3)^2 = 1.56 x 10^44 J/s\n\nFinally, we can estimate the total energy emitted in gravitational waves:\n\nE = (c^5/G) * (dE/dt) = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^5 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.56 x 10^44 J/s) = 2.46 x 10^46 J\n\nSo the estimated energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a mass of 20 solar masses, a distance of 10 kiloparsecs, and a duration of 0.1 seconds is approximately 2.46 x 10^46 Joules."
