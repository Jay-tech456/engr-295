    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, the minimum energy required to excite a mercury atom to its first excited state can be determined by the difference between the ionization energy and the energy of the first excited state. This energy difference is observed as the voltage drop across the tube in the experiment.\n\nThe ionization energy of the mercury atom is given as 10.43 eV. To find the energy of the first excited state, we need to know the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. This energy difference is known as the excitation energy.\n\nFor the mercury atom in the Franck-Hertz experiment, the excitation energy is approximately 4.9 eV. This value is obtained from experimental data.\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum energy required to excite the mercury atom to its first excited state:\n\nMinimum energy = Ionization energy - Excitation energy\nMinimum energy = 10.43 eV - 4.9 eV\nMinimum energy = 5.53 eV\n\nSo, the minimum energy required to excite a mercury atom to its first excited state is 5.53 eV.\n\nNext, we will calculate the corresponding wavelength of the emitted photon when the atom relaxes from the first excited state to the ground state. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship for photons:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.\n\nE = 5.53 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 8.86 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (8.86 x 10^-19 J)\nλ = 2.24 x 10^-7 m\n\nTo convert the wavelength to nanometers, we can multiply by 10^9:\n\nλ = 2.24 x 10^-7 m * 10^9 nm/m = 224 nm\n\nSo, the corresponding wavelength of the emitted photon when the mercury atom relaxes from the first excited state to the ground state is approximately 224 nm."
