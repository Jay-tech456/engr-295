    "message_2": "Tau leptons (τ) are the heaviest of the three generations of leptons, with a mass of about 1.777 GeV/c². They are unstable particles and decay through the weak force. The tau lepton has a very short lifetime of around 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds, and it decays into lighter particles. The possible decay modes of tau leptons can be broadly classified into two categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (electron or muon) and two neutrinos. The leptonic decay modes and their probabilities are:\n\n   a) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν_τ (Electron decay mode): This decay mode has a branching ratio (probability) of approximately 17.8%.\n\n   b) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν_τ (Muon decay mode): This decay mode has a branching ratio (probability) of approximately 17.4%.\n\n2. Hadronic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes can be further divided into one-prong and three-prong decays, depending on the number of charged particles in the final state. The hadronic decay modes and their probabilities are:\n\n   a) One-prong decays: These decays involve the production of one charged hadron (usually a charged pion or kaon) and a tau neutrino. The one-prong decay modes and their probabilities are:\n\n       i) τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ (Pion decay mode): This decay mode has a branching ratio (probability) of approximately 11.1%.\n\n       ii) τ⁻ → K⁻ + ν_τ (Kaon decay mode): This decay mode has a branching ratio (probability) of approximately 0.7%.\n\n   b) Three-prong decays: These decays involve the production of three charged hadrons (usually pions) and a tau neutrino. The three-prong decay modes and their probabilities are:\n\n       i) τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁻ + ν_τ (Three-pion decay mode): This decay mode has a branching ratio (probability) of approximately 9.3%.\n\nThere are other less common hadronic decay modes involving different combinations of hadrons, but their probabilities are much smaller.\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton can decay through various leptonic and hadronic decay modes. The most probable decay modes are the electron decay mode (17.8%), muon decay mode (17.4%), pion decay mode (11.1%), and three-pion decay mode (9.3%)."
