    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, the distance of closest approach (D) between an alpha particle and a gold nucleus can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nD = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K.E.)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the Coulomb constant (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2)\n- q1 and q2 are the charges of the alpha particle and gold nucleus, respectively\n- K.E. is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle\n\nThe alpha particle has a charge of +2e (where e is the elementary charge, 1.602 × 10^-19 C), and the gold nucleus has a charge of +79e (since gold has an atomic number of 79).\n\nq1 = 2e = 2 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C\nq2 = 79e = 79 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C\n\nThe kinetic energy of the alpha particle is given as 3.3 MeV, which we need to convert to Joules:\n\nK.E. = 3.3 MeV × (1.602 × 10^-13 J/MeV) = 5.2866 × 10^-13 J\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (2 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C) * (79 × 1.602 × 10^-19 C) / (2 * 5.2866 × 10^-13 J)\n\nD ≈ 2.31 × 10^-14 m\n\nSo, the distance of closest approach between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus in the Rutherford scattering experiment is approximately 2.31 × 10^-14 meters."
