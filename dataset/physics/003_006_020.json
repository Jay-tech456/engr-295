    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nFor a single loop, the magnetic field at the center is given by:\n\nB_single = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current = 2 A\nr = radius = 0.05 m (converted from 5 cm)\n\nNow, we have a 10-turn coil, so the total magnetic field at the center is the sum of the magnetic fields produced by each turn. Since all turns have the same current and radius, we can simply multiply the magnetic field of a single turn by the number of turns (N).\n\nB_total = N * B_single\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil:\n\n1. Calculate B_single:\nB_single = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\nB_single = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1π m)\nB_single = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\n2. Calculate B_total:\nB_total = 10 * B_single\nB_total = 10 * 8 × 10^(-6) T\nB_total = 80 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at the center of the 10-turn circular coil is 80 × 10^(-6) T, or 80 µT."
