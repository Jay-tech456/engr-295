    "message_1": "A high-energy particle in a laboratory is fired at a stationary target particle. If the high-energy particle has a velocity of 0.9c (where c represents the speed of light in a vacuum) and the target particle has a rest mass of 2 GeV/c^2, what is the minimum kinetic energy that the high-energy particle must have to create a collision that produces a new particle with a mass of 4 GeV/c^2?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of relativistic energy and momentum conservation. The total energy and momentum before the collision must be equal to the total energy and momentum after the collision.\n\nLet's denote the high-energy particle as particle 1 and the target particle as particle 2. The new particle created after the collision will be particle 3.\n\nBefore the collision:\n- Particle 1 has a velocity of 0.9c and some kinetic energy (K.E.) that we want to find.\n- Particle 2 is stationary, so it has no kinetic energy and no momentum.\n\nAfter the collision:\n- Particle 3 is created with a mass of 4 GeV/c^2.\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic energy and momentum for particle 1.\n\nThe relativistic energy (E) is given by the equation:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFor particle 1, v = 0.9c, so:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81) = 1 / sqrt(0.19) ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, let's denote the rest mass of particle 1 as m1. The relativistic energy of particle 1 is:\n\nE1 = γm1c^2 = 2.294m1c^2\n\nThe relativistic momentum (p) is given by the equation:\n\np = γmv\n\nFor particle 1:\n\np1 = γm1v = 2.294m1 * 0.9c ≈ 2.065m1c\n\nNow, let's apply energy and momentum conservation.\n\nEnergy conservation:\n\nE1 + E2 = E3\n\nwhere E2 is the energy of the stationary target particle (particle 2) and E3 is the energy of the new particle (particle 3).\n\nE2 = m2c^2 = (2 GeV/c^2)c^2 = 2 GeV\n\nE3 = m3c^2 = (4 GeV/c^2)c^2 = 4 GeV\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation becomes:\n\n2.294m1c^2 + 2 GeV = 4 GeV\n\nMomentum conservation:\n\np1 = p3\n\nSince particle 2 is stationary, it has no momentum. The momentum of particle 3 (p3) can be expressed as:\n\np3 = sqrt(E3^2/c^4 - m3^2c^2)\n\np3 = sqrt((4 GeV)^2/c^4 - (4 GeV/c^2)^2c^2) = sqrt(16 GeV^2/c^4 - 16 GeV^2/c^2) = 2sqrt(2) GeV/c\n\nNow, the momentum conservation equation becomes:\n\n2.065m1c = 2sqrt(2) GeV/c\n\nSolving for m1:\n\nm1 = (2sqrt(2) GeV/c) / (2.065c) ≈ 1.035 GeV/c^2\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of particle 1:\n\nK.E. = E1 - m1c^2 = 2.294m1c^2 - m1c^2 = (2.294 - 1)m1c^2 ≈ 1.294 * 1.035 GeV ≈ 1.34 GeV\n\nSo, the minimum kinetic energy that the high-energy particle must have to create a collision that produces a new particle with a mass of 4 GeV/c^2 is approximately 1.34 GeV."
