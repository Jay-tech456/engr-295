    "message_2": "When light passes through a polarizing filter, the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection is not directly affected by the polarization process. The polarization filter only affects the orientation of the electric field component of the light wave, allowing only a specific polarization direction to pass through.\n\nHowever, the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection is governed by the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence (the angle between the incoming light ray and the surface normal) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected light ray and the surface normal). Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nθi = θr\n\nwhere θi is the angle of incidence and θr is the angle of reflection.\n\nIn summary, the polarizing filter affects the polarization of the light wave but does not change the fundamental relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection, which remains equal according to the law of reflection."
