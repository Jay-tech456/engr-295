    "message_1": "A container filled with a viscous fluid is being rotated at a constant angular velocity about the vertical axis. The radius of the container is 10 cm and the height is 20 cm. Find the velocity and pressure distribution inside the fluid, assuming it has reached a steady-state. Also, determine the power required to maintain the rotation of the container.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Navier-Stokes equation for axisymmetric flow in cylindrical coordinates. The equation for the radial component of the velocity is:\n\nρ(v_r ∂v_r/∂r + v_z ∂v_r/∂z) = -∂P/∂r + μ(∂²v_r/∂r² + 1/r ∂v_r/∂r + ∂²v_r/∂z² - v_r/r²)\n\nSince the fluid is in a steady-state and the container is rotating about the vertical axis, we can assume that the radial and axial velocities (v_r and v_z) are zero. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n-∂P/∂r = μv_r/r²\n\nIntegrating with respect to r, we get:\n\nP(r) = -μv_r/r + C1\n\nwhere C1 is the integration constant. Since the pressure at the wall of the container (r = 10 cm) is atmospheric pressure (P_atm), we can find C1:\n\nP_atm = -μv_r/10 + C1\nC1 = P_atm + μv_r/10\n\nNow, we can find the pressure distribution inside the fluid:\n\nP(r) = -μv_r/r + P_atm + μv_r/10\n\nNext, we need to find the velocity distribution. The azimuthal component of the Navier-Stokes equation is:\n\nρ(v_r ∂v_θ/∂r + v_z ∂v_θ/∂z) = -∂P/∂θ + μ(∂²v_θ/∂r² + 1/r ∂v_θ/∂r + ∂²v_θ/∂z² - v_θ/r²)\n\nSince v_r and v_z are zero, and the fluid is incompressible, the equation simplifies to:\n\nμ(∂²v_θ/∂r² + 1/r ∂v_θ/∂r) = 0\n\nThis is the equation for the Couette flow between two concentric cylinders. The solution is:\n\nv_θ(r) = A*ln(r) + B\n\nwhere A and B are constants. Since the fluid is at rest at the wall of the container (r = 10 cm), we have:\n\nv_θ(10) = 0 = A*ln(10) + B\nB = -A*ln(10)\n\nThus, the velocity distribution is:\n\nv_θ(r) = A*(ln(r) - ln(10))\n\nFinally, we need to find the power required to maintain the rotation of the container. The power is given by the torque multiplied by the angular velocity:\n\nPower = τ*ω\n\nThe torque is given by the force exerted by the fluid on the wall of the container multiplied by the radius:\n\nτ = F*r = P_atm * 2πr * h * r\n\nThe angular velocity ω is related to the azimuthal velocity v_θ by:\n\nω = v_θ/r\n\nNow, we can find the power:\n\nPower = τ*ω = P_atm * 2πr * h * r * (v_θ/r) = P_atm * 2πr * h * v_θ\n\nSince we don't have the values for the viscosity (μ), the atmospheric pressure (P_atm), and the angular velocity (ω), we cannot provide numerical values for the pressure and velocity distributions or the power required to maintain the rotation. However, the expressions derived above can be used to find these values once the required parameters are known."
