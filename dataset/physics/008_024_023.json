    "message_2": "The expected mass and decay width of a hypothetical W' or Z' boson depend on the specific theoretical model being considered. These particles are predicted in various extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and models with extra dimensions. The masses of W' and Z' bosons can range from a few hundred GeV to several TeV, depending on the model parameters.\n\nFor example, in a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), the W' and Z' bosons are associated with the breaking of the left-right symmetry. In this model, the masses of W' and Z' are related to the mass of the known W and Z bosons and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields. The decay width of these particles depends on their masses and the coupling strengths to other particles.\n\nIn collider experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), W' and Z' bosons would be produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions. They would then decay into various final states, depending on their couplings to other particles. Some possible decay channels include:\n\n1. W' -> lν (lepton and neutrino, where l = e, μ, or τ)\n2. W' -> q'q (quark-antiquark pair, where q' is a different type of quark than q)\n3. Z' -> ll (lepton-antilepton pair, where l = e, μ, or τ)\n4. Z' -> qq (quark-antiquark pair)\n\nThe experimental signatures of these decays would depend on the specific decay channel and the masses of the W' and Z' bosons. For instance, if the W' or Z' boson is heavy enough, it could decay into a top quark and a bottom quark, leading to a distinctive signature involving multiple jets and missing transverse energy.\n\nSearches for W' and Z' bosons are ongoing at the LHC, using data collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. So far, no evidence for these particles has been found, and the experimental results have been used to set limits on their masses and couplings in various theoretical models."
