    "message_1": "A beam of light enters from air to a glass sheet at an angle of incidence of 60° with respect to the normal. If the refractive index of the glass is 1.5, find the critical angle and comment on the possibility of total internal reflection at this interface.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle, we can use the formula:\n\ncritical angle (θc) = arcsin(n2/n1)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the denser medium (glass) and n2 is the refractive index of the rarer medium (air). In this case, n1 = 1.5 (glass) and n2 = 1 (air).\n\nθc = arcsin(1/1.5)\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nThe critical angle for this glass-air interface is approximately 41.81°.\n\nNow, let's determine the angle of refraction when the light enters the glass sheet. We can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of air (1), θ1 is the angle of incidence (60°), n2 is the refractive index of glass (1.5), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\n1 * sin(60°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\nsin(θ2) = sin(60°) / 1.5\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(60°) / 1.5)\nθ2 ≈ 35.26°\n\nThe angle of refraction inside the glass is approximately 35.26°.\n\nSince the angle of refraction (35.26°) is less than the critical angle (41.81°), total internal reflection is not possible at this interface. Total internal reflection would only occur if the angle of incidence inside the glass (with respect to the normal) was greater than the critical angle."
