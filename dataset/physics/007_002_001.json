    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has an initial activity of 2400 disintegrations per minute. After 12 hours, the activity of the sample is 300 disintegrations per minute. What is the half-life of the radioactive material?",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of the radioactive material, we can use the decay formula:\n\nA = A0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\nA = final activity (300 disintegrations per minute)\nA0 = initial activity (2400 disintegrations per minute)\nt = time elapsed (12 hours)\nT = half-life (which we want to find)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time elapsed to minutes since the activity is given in disintegrations per minute:\n\n12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the decay formula:\n\n300 = 2400 * (1/2)^(720/T)\n\nDivide both sides by 2400:\n\n300/2400 = (1/2)^(720/T)\n\n0.125 = (1/2)^(720/T)\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.125) = log((1/2)^(720/T))\n\nlog(0.125) = (720/T) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = (720 * log(1/2)) / log(0.125)\n\nT â‰ˆ 239.9 minutes\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 239.9 minutes."
