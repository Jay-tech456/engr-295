Define the anharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.\n2. Write down the path integral expression for the ground state energy.\n3. Apply non-perturbative techniques to evaluate the path integral.\n\nStep 1: Define the anharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator can be written as:\n\nH = p^2/(2m) + V(x)\n\nwhere p is the momentum, m is the mass of the particle, and V(x) is the anharmonic potential. For simplicity, let's consider a quartic anharmonic potential:\n\nV(x) = (1/2)kx^2 + (1/4)gx^4\n\nwhere k and g are constants.\n\nStep 2: Write down the path integral expression for the ground state energy\n\nThe path integral expression for the ground state energy is given by:\n\nE_0 = -lim(T->∞) (1/T) ln(Z)\n\nwhere T is the imaginary time, and Z is the partition function given by the path integral:\n\nZ = ∫[Dx] exp(-S[x]/ħ)\n\nHere, S[x] is the Euclidean action, which can be obtained by Wick rotating the time variable t -> -iτ and integrating over the imaginary time interval [0, T]:\n\nS[x] = ∫₀^T dτ (1/2)m(dx/dτ)^2 + V(x)\n\nStep 3: Apply non-perturbative techniques to evaluate the path integral\n\nNon-perturbative techniques, such as instanton methods, can be used to evaluate the path integral. In this case, we will look for classical solutions (instantons) that minimize the Euclidean action S[x]. These solutions can be found by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd/dτ (m(dx/dτ)) - dV(x)/dx = 0\n\nFor the quartic anharmonic potential, this equation is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods or semiclassical approximations to find the instanton solutions. Once we have the instanton solutions, we can plug them back into the Euclidean action and evaluate the path integral.\n\nFinally, we can use the path integral expression for the ground state energy to find the non-perturbative estimate of the ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator.\n\nIn summary, the Feynman path integral expression for the ground state energy of a quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator can be derived using non-perturbative techniques in quantum field theory by defining the anharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, writing down the path integral expression for the ground state energy, and applying non-perturbative techniques to evaluate the path integral."
