    "message_2": "To find the maximum pressure ratio across a normal shock wave, we can use the normal shock relations for an ideal gas. The pressure ratio (P2/P1) can be determined using the following formula:\n\nP2/P1 = (1 + (γ - 1)/2 * M1^2) * (γ / (γ - 1 + M1^2))\n\nWhere:\nP2 = pressure after the shock wave\nP1 = pressure before the shock wave\nγ = specific heat ratio (1.4 for an ideal gas)\nM1 = Mach number before the shock wave (2.5)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the pressure ratio:\n\nP2/P1 = (1 + (1.4 - 1)/2 * 2.5^2) * (1.4 / (1.4 - 1 + 2.5^2))\n\nP2/P1 = (1 + 0.4/2 * 6.25) * (1.4 / (0.4 + 6.25))\n\nP2/P1 = (1 + 1.25) * (1.4 / 6.65)\n\nP2/P1 = 2.25 * 0.210526\n\nP2/P1 ≈ 0.473684\n\nThe maximum pressure ratio that can be achieved across a normal shock wave in an ideal gas with a specific heat ratio of 1.4 and a Mach number of 2.5 is approximately 0.47."
