    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): f = (1/π) * (5/256)^(3/8) * (GM/c^3) ^ (-5/8) * (1/t)^(3/8)\n\n2. Amplitude (h): h = (4/G) * (GM/c^2) * (1/d) * (πf)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the total mass of the binary system (2.6 times the mass of the sun)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- t is the time until coalescence (we'll assume the system is close to merging)\n- d is the distance from Earth (1.3 billion light-years)\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass and distance to SI units:\n- Mass of the sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n- M = 2.6 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.1714 x 10^30 kg\n- 1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n- d = 1.3 billion light-years * (9.461 x 10^15 m/light-year) = 1.23 x 10^25 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency (f):\nAssuming the system is close to merging, we can use t = 1 second as an approximation.\nf = (1/π) * (5/256)^(3/8) * (G * 5.1714 x 10^30 kg / c^3) ^ (-5/8) * (1 s)^(3/8)\nf ≈ 157.7 Hz\n\nNext, let's calculate the amplitude (h):\nh = (4/G) * (G * 5.1714 x 10^30 kg / c^2) * (1 / 1.23 x 10^25 m) * (π * 157.7 Hz)^(2/3)\nh ≈ 1.09 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the binary neutron star system is approximately 157.7 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.09 x 10^-22. Keep in mind that these values are rough estimates and depend on the assumptions made, such as the time until coalescence."
