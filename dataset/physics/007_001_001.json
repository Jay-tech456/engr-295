    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during the fusion of 1 gram of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms, we will use Einstein's famous equation, E = mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms. The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.00758 amu * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu = 1.25877 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of hydrogen atoms in 1 gram. The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1 amu, so there are approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms in 1 mole of hydrogen (Avogadro's number). \n\nNumber of atoms in 1 gram of hydrogen = (1 g / 1 g/mol) * 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol = 6.022 x 10^23 atoms\n\nNow, we need to find the total mass defect for the fusion of 1 gram of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal mass defect = (number of atoms) * (mass defect per atom) = 6.022 x 10^23 atoms * 1.25877 x 10^-29 kg/atom = 7.582 x 10^-6 kg\n\nFinally, we can use Einstein's equation to calculate the energy released.\n\nE = mc^2 = (7.582 x 10^-6 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 6.823 x 10^11 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released during the fusion of 1 gram of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms is approximately 6.823 x 10^11 Joules."
