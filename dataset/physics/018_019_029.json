    "message_2": "The probability of a top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a W boson in high-energy collisions is nearly 100%. This is because the top quark is highly unstable and has a very short lifetime, around 5 x 10^-25 seconds. The dominant decay mode for the top quark is through the weak force, which involves the emission of a W boson and the transformation of the top quark into a bottom quark. This process is known as the \"t -> Wb\" decay, and it occurs with a branching ratio close to 100%, making it the most likely decay mode for the top quark."
