    "message_2": "When a Mössbauer nucleus emits a gamma ray, there is a change in its energy. This change in energy is equal to the energy of the emitted gamma ray. Let's denote the energy of the gamma ray as E_gamma.\n\nThe energy of a gamma ray can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nE_gamma = h * f\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and f is the frequency of the gamma ray.\n\nNow, let's consider the corresponding change in the energy of the emitting atom. When a gamma ray is emitted, the atom undergoes a transition from an excited state to a lower energy state. The energy difference between these two states is equal to the energy of the emitted gamma ray, E_gamma.\n\nTherefore, the change in the energy of the Mössbauer nucleus and the emitting atom is the same, and it is equal to the energy of the emitted gamma ray, E_gamma."
