    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole and the size of its event horizon can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, and it is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole (M). The formula is given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, the Schwarzschild radius (and thus the size of the event horizon) also increases. This means that the event horizon becomes larger as the mass of the black hole increases. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. As the event horizon becomes larger, the region of space from which nothing can escape also becomes larger.\n\nTo see how the properties of the event horizon change with increasing mass, let's consider two black holes with different masses, M1 and M2, where M2 > M1. Using the Schwarzschild radius formula, we can find the radii of their event horizons:\n\nRs1 = 2GM1/c^2\nRs2 = 2GM2/c^2\n\nSince M2 > M1, it follows that Rs2 > Rs1. This means that the event horizon of the more massive black hole (M2) is larger than that of the less massive black hole (M1). As the mass of a black hole increases, its event horizon becomes larger, encompassing a greater region of space from which nothing can escape."
