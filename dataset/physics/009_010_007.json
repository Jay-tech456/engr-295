    "message_2": "To determine the position and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is equal to 2 times the focal length (f = R/2). In this case, the radius of curvature is 20 cm, so the focal length is:\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe object distance (u) is given as 30 cm. We can now use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n2/30 = 1/v\n\nInvert both sides to find v:\n\nv = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can determine the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -15 cm / 30 cm = -0.5\n\nThe magnification produced by the mirror is 0.5 (or 1/2) in magnitude, and the negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. The image is formed 15 cm in front of the mirror, and since the magnification is less than 1, the image is smaller than the object. The image is also real and inverted, as it is formed on the same side of the mirror as the object."
