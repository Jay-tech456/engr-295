    "message_1": "A 10 cm long wire is carrying a current of 2 A in the clockwise direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T * 2) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T (tesla).\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the magnetic field. Since the current is flowing in the clockwise direction, we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. Point your right thumb in the direction of the current (clockwise), and your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing into the plane (or page) at the location 5 cm from the wire.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T, and the direction is into the plane (or page)."
