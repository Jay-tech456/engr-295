    "message_2": "In a Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated by an electric field and collide with mercury atoms, causing excitation if the electron has enough energy. The minimum accelerating voltage (V) required to excite the mercury atoms to their first excited state can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = eV\n\nwhere E is the energy of the first excited state (4.9 eV), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), and V is the accelerating voltage.\n\nRearranging the formula to find V:\n\nV = E / e\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nV = (4.9 eV) / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C/eV)\n\nV ≈ 30.6 V\n\nSo, the minimum accelerating voltage required is approximately 30.6 V.\n\nNow, let's calculate the stopping voltage (Vs). The stopping voltage is the voltage required to prevent all electrons from reaching the collecting anode. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = eVs\n\nwhere E is the energy of the first excited state (4.9 eV), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), and Vs is the stopping voltage.\n\nRearranging the formula to find Vs:\n\nVs = E / e\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nVs = (4.9 eV) / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C/eV)\n\nVs ≈ 30.6 V\n\nSo, the stopping voltage required to prevent all electrons from reaching the collecting anode is approximately 30.6 V."
