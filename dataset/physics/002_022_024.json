    "message_1": "A physics student is required to calculate the activity coefficient of a substance that dissolves in a solution at 25°C. The solution contains 0.1 moles of solute and 1 liter of solvent. The measured vapor pressure of the solution is found to be 22.5 torr, while the vapor pressure of the pure solvent is 25 torr. Assuming ideal behavior, determine the activity coefficient of the solute in the solution.",
    "message_2": "To determine the activity coefficient of the solute in the solution, we can use the Raoult's Law, which states that the partial vapor pressure of a component in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction and its vapor pressure in the pure state. \n\nFor an ideal solution, the activity coefficient (γ) is equal to 1. The mole fraction (x) of the solute can be calculated using the given moles of solute and solvent. \n\nFirst, we need to find the mole fraction of the solvent (x₁) and solute (x₂). Since we have 0.1 moles of solute and 1 liter of solvent, we can assume that the solvent has a molar concentration of 1 mol/L (since it is a dilute solution). Therefore, the total moles in the solution are 1.1 moles.\n\nx₁ (solvent) = moles of solvent / total moles = 1 / 1.1 ≈ 0.909\nx₂ (solute) = moles of solute / total moles = 0.1 / 1.1 ≈ 0.091\n\nNow, we can apply Raoult's Law for the solvent:\n\nP_solution = x₁ * P_pure_solvent * γ₁\n\nwhere P_solution is the vapor pressure of the solution, P_pure_solvent is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, and γ₁ is the activity coefficient of the solvent.\n\nSince we are assuming ideal behavior, the activity coefficient of the solvent (γ₁) is equal to 1.\n\n22.5 torr = 0.909 * 25 torr * 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the activity coefficient of the solute (γ₂) using the relationship:\n\nγ₂ = (P_pure_solvent - P_solution) / (x₂ * P_pure_solvent)\n\nγ₂ = (25 torr - 22.5 torr) / (0.091 * 25 torr)\n\nγ₂ ≈ 1.0989\n\nTherefore, the activity coefficient of the solute in the solution is approximately 1.0989."
