    "message_2": "To calculate the angular velocity of a test particle in a circular orbit around a rotating black hole, we can use the formula for the angular velocity in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole:\n\nω = (a * M) / (r³ + a² * r + 2 * a² * M)\n\nwhere ω is the angular velocity, a is the spin parameter, M is the mass of the black hole, and r is the radial coordinate of the circular orbit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to geometrized units (where G = c = 1). The conversion factor is approximately 1 solar mass = 1.4766 km.\n\nMass of the black hole (M) = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.4766 km = 14.766 km\n\nNow, we need to find the radial coordinate (r) of the circular orbit. For a prograde orbit (orbiting in the same direction as the black hole's rotation), the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) can be found using the following formula:\n\nr_ISCO = M * (3 + Z₂ - ((3 - Z₁) * (3 + Z₁ + 2 * Z₂)^(1/2)))\n\nwhere Z₁ = 1 + (1 - a²)^(1/3) * ((1 + a)^(1/3) + (1 - a)^(1/3)) and Z₂ = (3 * a² + Z₁²)^(1/2)\n\nFor a = 0.9 and M = 14.766 km, we have:\n\nZ₁ = 1 + (1 - 0.9²)^(1/3) * ((1 + 0.9)^(1/3) + (1 - 0.9)^(1/3))\nZ₁ ≈ 1.889\n\nZ₂ = (3 * 0.9² + Z₁²)^(1/2)\nZ₂ ≈ 1.889\n\nr_ISCO = 14.766 * (3 + 1.889 - ((3 - 1.889) * (3 + 1.889 + 2 * 1.889)^(1/2)))\nr_ISCO ≈ 2.32 * 14.766\nr_ISCO ≈ 34.257\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular velocity (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = (a * M) / (r³ + a² * r + 2 * a² * M)\nω = (0.9 * 14.766) / (34.257³ + 0.9² * 34.257 + 2 * 0.9² * 14.766)\nω ≈ 13.289 / (40232.9 + 27.7 + 47.6)\nω ≈ 13.289 / 40308.2\nω ≈ 3.3 × 10^(-4) rad/km\n\nTo convert the angular velocity to more common units (rad/s), we can use the conversion factor 1 km = 3.3356 × 10^(-6) s:\n\nω ≈ 3.3 × 10^(-4) rad/km * (1 km / 3.3356 × 10^(-6) s)\nω ≈ 99 rad/s\n\nSo, the angular velocity of a test particle in a circular orbit around a rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses and a spin parameter of 0.9 is approximately 99 rad/s."
