    "message_1": "A light ray travels through air and is incident upon a glass surface at an angle of 60 degrees with the normal. If the refractive index of the glass is 1.5, what is the angle of refraction?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sinθ1 = n2 * sinθ2\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the refractive index and angle of refraction in the second medium (glass).\n\nThe refractive index of air is approximately 1. So, we have:\n\n1 * sin(60°) = 1.5 * sinθ2\n\nsin(60°) = 0.866\n\n0.866 = 1.5 * sinθ2\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsinθ2 = 0.866 / 1.5\nsinθ2 ≈ 0.577\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.577)\nθ2 ≈ 35.3°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 35.3 degrees."
