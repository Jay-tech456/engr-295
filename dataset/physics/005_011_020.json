    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the equation:\n\nm_rel = m_rest / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_rest is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the spaceship travels at a speed of 0.8c and has a rest mass of 1000 kg, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nm_rel = 1000 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nm_rel = 1000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm_rel = 1000 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm_rel = 1000 kg / 0.6\n\nm_rel â‰ˆ 1666.67 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship according to the observer on earth is approximately 1666.67 kg."
