    "message_2": "The Casimir force between two parallel plates in a vacuum can be calculated using the formula derived from the Casimir effect in quantum field theory. The formula for the Casimir force per unit area (F/A) is given by:\n\nF/A = -(ħcπ²)/(240d⁴)\n\nwhere:\n- F is the Casimir force\n- A is the area of the plates\n- ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately equal to 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s\n- d is the distance between the plates\n- π is the mathematical constant pi, approximately equal to 3.14159265\n\nTo calculate the Casimir force between two parallel plates at a distance 'd' apart in vacuum, simply plug in the values for ħ, c, and d into the formula and solve for F/A. Once you have the force per unit area, you can multiply it by the area of the plates to find the total Casimir force acting on the plates."
