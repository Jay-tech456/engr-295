    "message_1": "A beam of white light enters a prism at an angle of incidence of 60 degrees. After passing through the prism, the resulting spectrum is projected onto a screen which is 2 meters away from the prism. Upon close inspection, the student notices that the blue light is displaced by 7 cm from the red light. Calculate the angular dispersion and the refractive index of the prism. Take the speed of light in a vacuum to be 3 x 10^8 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angular dispersion and the refractive index of the prism, we need to first find the angle of deviation for both red and blue light. We can use the formula for the angular dispersion:\n\nAngular Dispersion (δ) = δ_blue - δ_red\n\nThe displacement of blue light from red light on the screen is 7 cm, and the distance from the prism to the screen is 2 meters (200 cm). We can use the small angle approximation to find the angular dispersion:\n\ntan(δ) ≈ δ = displacement / distance\nδ ≈ 7 cm / 200 cm = 0.035 radians\n\nNow we have the angular dispersion, which is 0.035 radians.\n\nNext, we need to find the refractive index of the prism. We can use Snell's Law to do this:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nWe know the angle of incidence (θ1) is 60 degrees. To find the angle of refraction (θ2), we can use the formula for the deviation angle:\n\nδ = θ1 - θ2\n\nWe have the angular dispersion (δ) and the angle of incidence (θ1), so we can find the angle of refraction (θ2) for both red and blue light:\n\nθ2_red = θ1 - δ_red\nθ2_blue = θ1 - δ_blue\n\nNow we can use Snell's Law for both red and blue light:\n\nn1 * sin(60) = n_red * sin(θ2_red)\nn1 * sin(60) = n_blue * sin(θ2_blue)\n\nWe know that the refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1. We can use the known values of the speed of light in a vacuum (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s) and the speed of light in the medium for red and blue light (c_red and c_blue) to find the refractive indices (n_red and n_blue):\n\nn_red = c / c_red\nn_blue = c / c_blue\n\nFinally, we can find the refractive index of the prism (n) by taking the average of the refractive indices for red and blue light:\n\nn = (n_red + n_blue) / 2\n\nBy solving these equations, we can find the refractive index of the prism."
