    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = ΣnΔHf(products) - ΣnΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, n is the number of moles, and ΔHf is the heat of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(g)\n\nThe heat of formation of water vapor (H₂O) is given as -285.8 kJ/mol. The heat of formation of elements in their standard state (H₂ and O₂) is zero.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔH = [2 moles × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(2 moles × 0 kJ/mol) + (1 mole × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = (-571.6 kJ) - (0 kJ)\n\nΔH = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ."
