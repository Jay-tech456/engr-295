    "message_1": "A metal cube with a volume of 0.08 m^3 is suspended from a spring balance and weighed in air, showing a reading of 705 N. When the cube is then completely immersed in water, the weight reading on the spring balance changes. Determine the weight of the cube when it is submerged in water and also calculate the upward force exerted by the water on the cube. (Assume the density of water = 1000 kg/m^3 and the acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s^2).",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the mass of the cube using its weight in air:\n\nWeight = Mass × Gravity\n705 N = Mass × 9.8 m/s²\nMass = 705 N / 9.8 m/s² = 72 kg\n\nNow, let's find the buoyant force exerted by the water on the cube. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the cube:\n\nBuoyant force = Weight of displaced water = Mass of displaced water × Gravity\n\nThe mass of the displaced water can be found using the volume of the cube and the density of water:\n\nMass of displaced water = Volume × Density of water\nMass of displaced water = 0.08 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ = 80 kg\n\nNow, we can find the buoyant force:\n\nBuoyant force = Mass of displaced water × Gravity\nBuoyant force = 80 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 784 N\n\nWhen the cube is submerged in water, the spring balance will show the difference between the weight of the cube in air and the buoyant force:\n\nWeight_submerged = Weight_in_air - Buoyant_force\nWeight_submerged = 705 N - 784 N = -79 N\n\nSince the weight is negative, it means that the cube is actually experiencing an upward force when submerged in water. The upward force exerted by the water on the cube is equal to the buoyant force, which is 784 N."
