    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a velocity of 0.6c relative to Earth. Its length when stationary is 200 meters. What is the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth? Use the formula for length contraction in the theory of special relativity to find your answer.",
    "message_2": "In the theory of special relativity, the length contraction formula is given by:\n\nL = L₀ * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length as measured by the observer on Earth, L₀ is the proper length (length when stationary), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the spaceship's velocity v = 0.6c and its stationary length L₀ = 200 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(0.64)\n\nL = 200 * 0.8\n\nL = 160 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth is 160 meters."
