    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot draw diagrams. However, I can guide you through the process of drawing the ray diagram and help you find the image location, size, and nature of the image formed.\n\n1. Draw the mirror: Draw a concave mirror with its principal axis (a horizontal line passing through the center of the mirror).\n\n2. Mark the focal point (F) and center of curvature (C): Since the focal length is 15 cm, mark a point F on the principal axis 15 cm to the left of the mirror's vertex (V). The center of curvature (C) is twice the focal length, so mark point C at 30 cm to the left of the vertex.\n\n3. Place the object: Draw a vertical arrow representing the object (O) 20 cm to the left of the mirror's vertex on the principal axis.\n\n4. Draw the rays: Draw three rays from the top of the object:\n\n   a. Ray 1: Draw a parallel ray to the principal axis from the top of the object towards the mirror. After reflecting, this ray will pass through the focal point (F).\n   \n   b. Ray 2: Draw a ray from the top of the object through the focal point (F) towards the mirror. After reflecting, this ray will be parallel to the principal axis.\n   \n   c. Ray 3: Draw a ray from the top of the object through the center of curvature (C) towards the mirror. This ray will reflect back along the same path.\n\n5. Find the image: The point where the reflected rays intersect (or appear to intersect) is the location of the image (I). In this case, the rays will intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, indicating a real image.\n\n6. Determine the image size and nature: Measure the distance from the image (I) to the mirror's vertex (V) to find the image distance (di). Measure the height of the image (hi) and compare it to the height of the object (ho). In this case, the image will be inverted and smaller than the object.\n\nTo calculate the image distance and height mathematically, you can use the mirror formula and magnification formula:\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di\nMagnification formula: M = hi/ho = -di/do\n\nGiven the object distance (do) is 20 cm and the focal length (f) is 15 cm, you can solve for the image distance (di):\n\n1/15 = 1/20 + 1/di\n1/di = 1/15 - 1/20\n1/di = (20 - 15) / (15 * 20)\n1/di = 5 / 300\ndi = 300 / 5\ndi = 60 cm\n\nThe image is formed 60 cm to the left of the mirror's vertex. Now, you can find the magnification (M):\n\nM = -di/do = -60/20 = -3\n\nThe magnification is -3, which means the image is inverted and three times smaller than the object."
