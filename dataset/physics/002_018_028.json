    "message_2": "Boyle's Law states that the product of pressure and volume of a gas is constant at a constant temperature. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nwhere P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume.\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (P1) as 1.5 atm, the initial volume (V1) as 1.0 L, and the initial temperature (T1) as 298 K. We need to find the Boyle temperature (T2) when the gas reaches Boyle's Law conditions.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law equation for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L*atm/mol*K), and T is temperature.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nn = (1.5 atm) * (1.0 L) / (0.0821 L*atm/mol*K) * (298 K)\nn ≈ 0.0612 mol\n\nNow, we can use Boyle's Law to find the final pressure (P2) when the gas reaches Boyle's Law conditions:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nSince we are looking for the Boyle temperature, we can assume that the volume (V2) will be the same as the initial volume (V1) at the Boyle temperature. Therefore, V2 = 1.0 L.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * V1 / V2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP2 = (1.5 atm) * (1.0 L) / (1.0 L)\nP2 = 1.5 atm\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law equation again to find the Boyle temperature (T2):\n\nPV = nRT\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for T:\n\nT = PV / nR\n\nPlugging in the values for P2, V2, n, and R:\n\nT2 = (1.5 atm) * (1.0 L) / (0.0612 mol) * (0.0821 L*atm/mol*K)\nT2 ≈ 303.6 K\n\nThe Boyle temperature of the gas sample is approximately 303.6 K."
