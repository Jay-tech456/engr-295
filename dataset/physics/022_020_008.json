    "message_2": "To determine the minimum mass of a supersymmetric particle required for it to be a viable candidate for dark matter, we need to consider the constraints from the observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and other cosmological data.\n\nSupersymmetric particles, such as neutralinos, are considered as potential candidates for dark matter due to their weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) nature. The mass of these particles should be large enough to account for the observed dark matter density in the universe.\n\nThe Planck satellite mission, which has provided precise measurements of the CMB, has determined the dark matter density parameter (Î©_DM) to be approximately 0.26. This means that dark matter contributes to about 26% of the total energy density of the universe.\n\nTo be a viable dark matter candidate, a supersymmetric particle should satisfy the relic abundance constraint, which is derived from the thermal freeze-out mechanism. This constraint depends on the particle's mass, annihilation cross-section, and other model-dependent factors.\n\nBased on current experimental data and theoretical considerations, the lower limit for the mass of a supersymmetric dark matter particle is typically around a few GeV (gigaelectronvolts). However, this value is model-dependent and can vary depending on the specific supersymmetric model and its parameters.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass of a supersymmetric particle required for it to be a viable candidate for dark matter, given the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, is typically on the order of a few GeV. However, this value is subject to change as more experimental data and theoretical developments become available."
