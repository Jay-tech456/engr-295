    "message_2": "To measure the decay modes of a Higgs boson with higher precision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Increase the amount of data collected: By increasing the number of proton-proton collisions at the LHC, more Higgs bosons can be produced, and their decay modes can be studied with higher statistical precision. This can be achieved by increasing the luminosity of the LHC, which is the number of collisions per unit area per unit time.\n\n2. Improve detector performance: Enhancing the performance of the detectors used at the LHC, such as the ATLAS and CMS detectors, can lead to better identification and reconstruction of the particles produced in Higgs boson decays. This can be achieved through hardware upgrades, better calibration, and improved algorithms for particle identification and tracking.\n\n3. Optimize analysis techniques: Developing more sophisticated analysis techniques can help to better separate the signal (Higgs boson decays) from the background (other processes that can mimic the Higgs boson decay). This can involve using advanced statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and better understanding of the theoretical predictions for both the signal and background processes.\n\n4. Study rare decay modes: Some decay modes of the Higgs boson are more challenging to measure due to their low branching ratios or difficult experimental signatures. Focusing on these rare decay modes can provide additional information about the Higgs boson properties and help to improve the overall precision of the measurements.\n\n5. Combine results from different experiments: By combining the results from different experiments at the LHC, such as ATLAS and CMS, the overall precision of the Higgs boson decay measurements can be improved. This is because the combined results benefit from the different strengths and systematic uncertainties of each experiment.\n\n6. Exploit future collider upgrades: The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is a planned upgrade of the LHC that aims to increase the luminosity by a factor of 10. This will result in a much larger dataset, allowing for more precise measurements of the Higgs boson decay modes. Additionally, future colliders, such as the proposed Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) or the International Linear Collider (ILC), could provide even more precise measurements of the Higgs boson properties.\n\nBy employing these strategies, physicists can improve the precision of the Higgs boson decay mode measurements at the LHC and gain a deeper understanding of the Higgs boson and its role in the fundamental structure of the universe."
