    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. The range of masses for primordial black holes is quite wide, spanning from very small (less than the mass of an asteroid) to thousands of solar masses. The exact range depends on the specific model of the early universe and the assumptions made about the density fluctuations.\n\nThe theoretical range of masses for primordial black holes can be roughly divided into three categories:\n\n1. Micro black holes: These have masses less than 10^15 grams (about the mass of a small asteroid). They are expected to have evaporated by now due to Hawking radiation if they ever existed.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass black holes: These have masses between 10^15 grams and a few solar masses. They could still exist today and might contribute to dark matter.\n\n3. Massive primordial black holes: These have masses larger than a few solar masses, up to thousands of solar masses. They could have played a role in the formation of galaxies and other large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nIn comparison, the masses of known black holes that have formed from stellar collapse or mergers of other black holes typically fall within the range of a few solar masses to several tens of solar masses. These are called stellar-mass black holes. There are also supermassive black holes, which have masses between millions to billions of solar masses, found at the centers of galaxies. However, these supermassive black holes are thought to have formed through different processes, such as the accretion of mass onto a seed black hole or the direct collapse of a massive gas cloud.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical range of masses for primordial black holes is quite broad, from less than the mass of an asteroid to thousands of solar masses. This range overlaps with the masses of known stellar-mass black holes but does not include the much larger supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies."
