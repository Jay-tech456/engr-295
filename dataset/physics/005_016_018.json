    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the total energy of the system before the collision, and then use conservation of energy to find the kinetic energy of each particle after the collision.\n\n1. Find the relativistic energy of the moving particle before the collision:\n\nThe relativistic energy E of a particle is given by the equation:\n\nE = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor the moving particle, we have:\n\nm = 2 GeV/c²\nv = 0.8c\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nE = (2 GeV/c² * c²) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nE = 2 GeV / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE = 2 GeV / sqrt(0.36)\nE = 2 GeV / 0.6\nE = 10/3 GeV\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the moving particle before the collision is 10/3 GeV.\n\n2. Find the total energy of the system before the collision:\n\nThe total energy of the system before the collision is the sum of the relativistic energy of the moving particle and the rest energy of the stationary particle:\n\nTotal energy = 10/3 GeV + 2 GeV = 16/3 GeV\n\n3. Use conservation of energy to find the kinetic energy of each particle after the collision:\n\nSince the total energy of the system is conserved, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two particles after the collision must be equal to the total energy before the collision:\n\nK1 + K2 = 16/3 GeV\n\nSince the particles are identical and the collision is head-on, they will have the same kinetic energy after the collision:\n\nK1 = K2\n\nSo, we can write:\n\n2K = 16/3 GeV\n\nNow, we can solve for the kinetic energy of each particle:\n\nK = (16/3 GeV) / 2\nK = 8/3 GeV\n\nTherefore, the relativistic kinetic energy of each of the particles after the collision is 8/3 GeV."
