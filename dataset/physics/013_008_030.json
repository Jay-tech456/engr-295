    "message_2": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. GRBs can last from a few milliseconds to several minutes, and they are typically classified into two categories based on their duration:\n\n1. Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs): These bursts have a duration of less than 2 seconds. They are believed to be caused by the merger of two compact objects, such as neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole.\n\n2. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs): These bursts last for more than 2 seconds, with some lasting up to several minutes. LGRBs are thought to be caused by the collapse of massive stars, specifically those with a mass greater than 20 times that of our Sun. This collapse leads to the formation of a black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star, known as a magnetar.\n\nThe energy range of gamma-ray bursts is quite broad, typically ranging from a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to several GeV (giga-electron volts). The peak energy of the spectrum usually lies in the range of 100 keV to a few MeV (mega-electron volts).\n\nThe physical processes that cause these powerful explosions involve the release of a large amount of energy in a very short time. In the case of LGRBs, the core-collapse of a massive star leads to the formation of a highly relativistic jet, which is a narrow beam of matter and energy moving at nearly the speed of light. This jet interacts with the surrounding material, producing gamma rays through a process called synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. For SGRBs, the merger of compact objects also results in the formation of a relativistic jet, which generates gamma rays through similar processes.\n\nIn summary, the energy range of gamma-ray bursts typically spans from a few keV to several GeV, with durations ranging from milliseconds to minutes. The physical processes causing these powerful explosions include the core-collapse of massive stars and the merger of compact objects, both of which lead to the formation of relativistic jets that emit gamma rays through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering."
