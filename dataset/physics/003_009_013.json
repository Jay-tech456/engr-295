    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the problem states that the sphere carries a current, we need to clarify the distribution of the current on the sphere. For simplicity, let's assume that the current is uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the sphere has a radius of 2 cm, the surface area of the sphere is:\n\nA = 4πr² = 4π(0.02 m)² ≈ 0.0050265 m²\n\nThe total current on the sphere is 3 A, so the current density (current per unit area) is:\n\nJ = I / A ≈ 3 A / 0.0050265 m² ≈ 597.16 A/m²\n\nNow, let's consider a small area dA on the surface of the sphere. The current through this small area is:\n\ndI = J * dA\n\nThe magnetic field dB at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the center of the sphere due to this small current is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the sphere is symmetric, the magnetic field contributions from all the small current elements on the surface will have the same magnitude but different directions. Due to symmetry, the net magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the sphere will be along the radial direction (from the center of the sphere to the point where we are measuring the magnetic field).\n\nTo find the net magnetic field, we can integrate the magnetic field contributions from all the small current elements on the surface of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫ dB\n\nHowever, this integral is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques to solve. Instead, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a uniformly distributed current on the surface of a sphere:\n\nB = (2/3) * (μ₀ * J * R³) / r³\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere and r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where we are measuring the magnetic field.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (2/3) * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (597.16 A/m²) * (0.02 m)³ / (0.05 m)³\nB ≈ (2/3) * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (597.16 A/m²) * (8 × 10⁻⁹ m³) / (1.25 × 10⁻⁷ m³)\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 1.2566 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla)."
