    "message_2": "The probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) using a ground-based interferometer like LIGO depends on several factors, including the mass range of the PBHs, their abundance, the sensitivity of the detector, and the observation time.\n\nTo estimate the probability, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the mass range of the PBHs: The mass range of PBHs that can be detected by LIGO typically falls between 1 and 100 solar masses.\n\n2. Estimate the abundance of PBHs: The abundance of PBHs in the universe is still uncertain. However, it is generally believed that they make up a small fraction of the total dark matter. For this estimation, let's assume that the fraction of dark matter in PBHs (f_PBH) is 0.1%.\n\n3. Calculate the expected number of PBH mergers: The merger rate of PBHs (R_PBH) can be estimated using their abundance, mass range, and other astrophysical parameters. For example, a recent study estimated the merger rate to be around 0.1 - 100 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1) for PBHs in the mass range detectable by LIGO.\n\n4. Determine the sensitivity of the detector: LIGO's sensitivity depends on the frequency of the gravitational waves, which is related to the mass of the merging PBHs. For PBHs in the mass range of 1-100 solar masses, LIGO can detect gravitational waves up to a distance of about 1 Gpc.\n\n5. Calculate the observation time: The longer the observation time, the higher the probability of detecting a PBH merger. Let's assume an observation time of 1 year for this estimation.\n\n6. Estimate the probability of detection: The probability of detecting a PBH merger can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nP_detection = 1 - exp(-R_PBH * V * T)\n\nwhere P_detection is the probability of detection, R_PBH is the merger rate of PBHs, V is the sensitive volume of the detector (which can be estimated using the detector's sensitivity and the mass range of PBHs), and T is the observation time.\n\nUsing the values mentioned above, the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of primordial black holes with a given mass range using a ground-based interferometer such as LIGO can be estimated. However, it is important to note that these values are based on several assumptions and uncertainties, and the actual probability may be different."
