    "message_2": "To calculate the distance of the image from the mirror and its magnification, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the mirror\nu = object distance from the mirror\nv = image distance from the mirror\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half of the radius of curvature (R):\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature (R) is 20 cm, the focal length (f) is:\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe object distance (u) is given as 30 cm. Now, we can find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator (30) and then solve for v:\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/v\n2/30 = 1/v\nv = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 15 cm from the mirror.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -15 cm / 30 cm = -0.5\n\nThe magnification is -0.5, which means the image is inverted and half the size of the object.\n\nTo find the height of the image (h'), we can use the magnification formula:\n\nh' = M * h\n\nWhere:\nh = height of the object (5 cm)\n\nh' = -0.5 * 5 cm = -2.5 cm\n\nThe image is 2.5 cm tall and inverted.\n\nIn summary, the image is 15 cm away from the mirror, the magnification is -0.5, and the image is 2.5 cm tall and inverted."
