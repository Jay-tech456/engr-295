    "message_2": "The rest mass of the tau lepton is approximately 1.77686 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared). This value is obtained from experimental measurements in particle physics experiments.\n\nIn particle physics experiments, the mass of the tau lepton is typically measured using a technique called mass reconstruction. This involves analyzing the decay products of the tau lepton and using conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum, to determine the mass of the parent particle (in this case, the tau lepton).\n\nThe tau lepton is unstable and decays into various lighter particles, such as electrons, muons, neutrinos, and hadrons. When a tau lepton is produced in a high-energy collision, it quickly decays, and the resulting decay products are detected by the particle detectors in the experiment. By measuring the energies and momenta of these decay products, physicists can reconstruct the invariant mass of the tau lepton using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nBy analyzing a large number of tau lepton decays and performing statistical analyses, the rest mass of the tau lepton can be determined with high precision. The current value of the tau lepton mass is based on the combined results of various experiments, such as those conducted at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)."
