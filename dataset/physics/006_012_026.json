    "message_2": "The ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state. For a hydrogen atom, the ionization energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nIonization Energy = -E = - (R_H * Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 13.6 eV), Z is the atomic number (for hydrogen, Z = 1), and n is the principal quantum number (for the ground state, n = 1).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nIonization Energy = - (-13.6 eV * 1^2 / 1^2)\nIonization Energy = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of a hydrogen atom is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
