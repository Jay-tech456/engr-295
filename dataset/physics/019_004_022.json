    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section for electron-positron annihilation to produce a muon-antimuon pair at a center-of-mass energy of 2 GeV, we will use the Mandelstam variables and the Feynman rules in quantum field theory. The process we are considering is e⁻ + e⁺ → μ⁻ + μ⁺, which is mediated by a virtual photon.\n\nFirst, let's define the Mandelstam variables:\n\ns = (p₁ + p₂)² = (p₃ + p₄)²\nt = (p₁ - p₃)² = (p₂ - p₄)²\nu = (p₁ - p₄)² = (p₂ - p₃)²\n\nwhere p₁ and p₂ are the 4-momenta of the incoming electron and positron, and p₃ and p₄ are the 4-momenta of the outgoing muon and antimuon.\n\nFor this process, the matrix element squared, |M|², can be written as:\n\n|M|² = 4e⁴[(s² + u²) / t²]\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge.\n\nNow, we can calculate the differential cross-section:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1/64π²s)|M|²\n\nTo obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate over the solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫dσ/dΩ dΩ\n\nFor this specific process, the integration can be simplified as:\n\nσ = (1/64π²s)|M|² * 4π\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\ns = (2 GeV)² = 4 GeV²\ne = 1/137 (the fine-structure constant)\n\n|M|² = 4(1/137)⁴[(s² + u²) / t²] = 4(1/137)⁴[(4 GeV²)² + (4 GeV²)²] / (4 GeV²)² = 16(1/137)⁴\n\nσ = (1/64π²(4 GeV²)) * 16(1/137)⁴ * 4π = (1/16π(4 GeV²)) * 16(1/137)⁴\n\nσ ≈ 4.3 * 10⁻¹² cm²\n\nSo, the cross-section for electron-positron annihilation to produce a muon-antimuon pair at a center-of-mass energy of 2 GeV is approximately 4.3 * 10⁻¹² cm²."
