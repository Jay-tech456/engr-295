    "message_2": "To find the frequency detected by an observer on Earth, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere:\nf_observed = frequency detected by the observer on Earth\nf_emitted = frequency emitted by the spaceship (10 MHz)\nv = velocity of the spaceship relative to the Earth (0.6c)\nc = speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * sqrt(4)\n\nf_observed = 10 MHz * 2\n\nf_observed = 20 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the signal detected by an observer on Earth is 20 MHz."
