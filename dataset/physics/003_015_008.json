    "message_1": "A square wire loop carrying a current of 5 A is placed in the x-y plane with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The length of each side of the loop is 2 meters. Determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetric, we can find the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. We can divide this side into small segments of length dl. The position vector r for each segment will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop and have a magnitude equal to half the side length (1 m).\n\nFor each segment, the angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can write the Biot-Savart Law for one side of the loop:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nSince the current, permeability of free space, and r are constants, we can integrate this expression over the entire side of the loop:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * r / 4π * r³) * ∫dl = (μ₀ * I / 4π * r²) * L\n\nwhere L is the length of one side of the loop (2 m).\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop by multiplying B_side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = 4 * (μ₀ * I / 4π * r²) * L\n\nPlugging in the given values (I = 5 A, L = 2 m, r = 1 m):\n\nB_total = 4 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A / 4π * (1 m)²) * 2 m\n\nB_total = 4 * (10⁻⁶ T) * 2 m = 8 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 8 × 10⁻⁶ T."
