    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of atomic energy levels and the corresponding spectral lines due to the presence of an external electric field. This effect is named after Johannes Stark, who first observed it in 1913. The Stark effect can be observed in both absorption and emission spectra of atoms and molecules. The variation of the Stark effect with changes in the strength of an applied electric field and the atomic structure of the atom can be described as follows:\n\n1. Strength of the applied electric field: The degree of splitting of the energy levels and the corresponding spectral lines is directly proportional to the strength of the applied electric field. As the electric field strength increases, the energy level splitting becomes more pronounced, leading to a more significant shift in the spectral lines. This relationship can be described by the formula:\n\nΔE = q * E * Δr\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, q is the charge of the electron, E is the electric field strength, and Δr is the change in the electron's position due to the electric field.\n\n2. Atomic structure of the atom: The Stark effect also depends on the atomic structure of the atom, specifically the distribution of the electron cloud and the quantum numbers associated with the atomic energy levels. The effect is more pronounced in atoms with a larger spatial distribution of the electron cloud, as the applied electric field can more easily distort the electron cloud and cause a shift in the energy levels.\n\nFor atoms with a single electron in the outer shell (such as hydrogen), the Stark effect can be described using the quantum numbers n, l, and m (principal, azimuthal, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively). The energy level splitting depends on the values of these quantum numbers, with the splitting being more significant for higher values of n and l. Additionally, the Stark effect is more pronounced for states with higher degeneracy, as the applied electric field can lift the degeneracy and cause a greater splitting of the energy levels.\n\nIn summary, the Stark effect in atomic spectra varies with changes in the strength of an applied electric field and the atomic structure of the atom. The degree of energy level splitting and the corresponding shift in spectral lines increase with the strength of the electric field and depend on the distribution of the electron cloud and the quantum numbers associated with the atomic energy levels."
