    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of heat transfer through the steel plate, we can use the formula for heat conduction:\n\nQ = (k * A * ΔT) / d\n\nwhere:\nQ = rate of heat transfer (W)\nk = thermal conductivity of the material (W/mK)\nA = surface area of the material (m²)\nΔT = temperature difference across the material (°C)\nd = thickness of the material (m)\n\nGiven values:\nk = 50 W/mK (thermal conductivity of steel)\nA = 2 m² (surface area)\nΔT = 100°C (temperature difference)\nd = 5 cm = 0.05 m (thickness, converted to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (50 * 2 * 100) / 0.05\n\nQ = (10000) / 0.05\n\nQ = 200000 W\n\nThe rate of heat transfer through the steel plate is 200,000 watts."
