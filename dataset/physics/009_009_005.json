    "message_1": "What is the distance between an object and its real image formed by a converging lens of focal length 30 cm when the object is placed 40 cm away from the lens?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the distance between the object and the lens, and v is the distance between the image and the lens.\n\nGiven:\nf = 30 cm (converging lens)\nu = 40 cm (object distance)\n\nWe need to find v (image distance).\n\nPlugging the given values into the lens formula:\n\n1/30 = 1/40 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n120 = 3v + 4v\n\nNow combine the terms with v:\n\n7v = 120\n\nNow divide both sides by 7 to isolate v:\n\nv = 120 / 7\n\nv â‰ˆ 17.14 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the object and its real image formed by the converging lens is approximately 17.14 cm."
