    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion to occur between two hydrogen atoms is approximately 10 million Kelvin (10 MK or 10^7 K). At this temperature, hydrogen nuclei (protons) have enough kinetic energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them, allowing the strong nuclear force to bind them together and initiate the fusion process.\n\nIn the laboratory, this temperature can be achieved using several plasma physics techniques. Two of the most common methods are:\n\n1. Magnetic confinement fusion: In this approach, a plasma of hydrogen isotopes (typically deuterium and tritium) is confined in a magnetic field, usually in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) configuration. The most common type of magnetic confinement device is the tokamak. The plasma is heated by a combination of ohmic heating (induced by a current flowing through the plasma), neutral beam injection, and radio-frequency heating. The magnetic field helps to confine the plasma and prevent it from coming into contact with the walls of the reactor, which would cause it to lose energy and cool down.\n\n2. Inertial confinement fusion: In this method, a small pellet of hydrogen isotopes is compressed and heated rapidly, usually by high-energy laser beams or intense X-ray radiation. The compression increases the density of the fuel, while the heating raises its temperature to the levels required for fusion. The rapid heating and compression create a short-lived, high-pressure plasma, in which fusion reactions can occur before the fuel disperses and cools down.\n\nBoth of these techniques are still under development and have not yet achieved sustained, energy-positive fusion reactions. However, they represent the primary approaches being pursued for harnessing nuclear fusion as a future energy source."
