    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of an excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can use the following formula:\n\nτ = (1/A)\n\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the excited state and A is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the Einstein coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA = (64π^4 e^2 n^3) / (3h c^3) * |R_nl|^2\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), n is the principal quantum number, and R_nl is the radial part of the wave function.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the radial part of the wave function can be expressed as:\n\nR_nl = (2Z/n^2) * (2Za_0)^(-3/2) * e^(-Zr/na_0) * L_n-1^(2Z-1)(2Zr/na_0)\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), a_0 is the Bohr radius (5.29 x 10^-11 m), and L_n-1^(2Z-1) is the associated Laguerre polynomial.\n\nFor n = 3, the radial part of the wave function simplifies to:\n\nR_30 = (2/3^2) * (2a_0)^(-3/2) * e^(-r/3a_0) * L_2^1(2r/3a_0)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the square of the radial part of the wave function:\n\n|R_30|^2 = [(2/3^2) * (2a_0)^(-3/2) * e^(-r/3a_0) * L_2^1(2r/3a_0)]^2\n\nSince we are only interested in the order of magnitude of the lifetime, we can approximate |R_30|^2 as:\n\n|R_30|^2 ≈ (1/9)\n\nNow, we can calculate the Einstein coefficient:\n\nA ≈ (64π^4 e^2 n^3) / (3h c^3) * (1/9)\nA ≈ (64π^4 (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 (3)^3) / (3(6.63 x 10^-34 Js) (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3) * (1/9)\n\nA ≈ 6.54 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the lifetime of the excited state:\n\nτ = (1/A)\nτ = 1 / (6.54 x 10^6 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 1.53 x 10^-7 s\n\nTherefore, the lifetime of an excited state with principal quantum number n = 3 in a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.53 x 10^-7 seconds."
