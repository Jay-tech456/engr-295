    "message_2": "The typical density of a molecular cloud in the interstellar medium is relatively low, ranging from about 100 to 10^6 particles per cubic centimeter (cm^3). Molecular clouds are primarily composed of hydrogen molecules (H2), with trace amounts of other molecules and dust particles. Despite their low density, molecular clouds are the primary sites for star formation in galaxies.\n\nStar formation in molecular clouds is affected by several factors, including the cloud's density, temperature, and the presence of external forces such as gravity and magnetic fields. The process can be briefly explained as follows:\n\n1. Gravitational collapse: When a region within a molecular cloud reaches a critical density, gravity starts to dominate over the internal pressure and other forces, causing the cloud to contract. This process is known as gravitational collapse.\n\n2. Fragmentation: As the cloud contracts, it may fragment into smaller, denser clumps due to instabilities and turbulence. These clumps, or cores, are the sites where individual stars will form.\n\n3. Protostar formation: Within these dense cores, the material continues to collapse under gravity, forming a central concentration of mass called a protostar. The protostar is surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust, which will eventually form planets and other celestial bodies.\n\n4. Nuclear fusion: As the protostar continues to accumulate mass and contract, its core temperature and pressure increase. When the core temperature reaches around 10 million Kelvin, nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium begins, releasing energy in the form of light and radiation. This marks the birth of a new star.\n\nThe density of a molecular cloud plays a crucial role in determining the rate and efficiency of star formation. Higher density regions are more likely to undergo gravitational collapse and form stars, while lower density regions may remain stable and not form stars. Additionally, the density of a molecular cloud can influence the mass distribution of the resulting stars, with denser regions potentially forming more massive stars.\n\nIn summary, the density of molecular clouds in the interstellar medium is a key factor in star formation. The physical processes leading to star formation involve gravitational collapse, fragmentation, protostar formation, and the initiation of nuclear fusion."
