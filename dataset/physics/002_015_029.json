    "message_1": "A heat pump extracts heat from a cold reservoir at a temperature of 5°C and delivers it to a hot reservoir at a temperature of 30°C. If the heat pump requires 2 kW of work input to transfer 8 kW of heat from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir, what is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the hot reservoir (Q_H) to the work input (W) required to operate the heat pump.\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\n\nGiven that the heat pump transfers 8 kW of heat from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir (Q_H = 8 kW) and requires 2 kW of work input (W = 2 kW), we can calculate the COP as follows:\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\nCOP = 8 kW / 2 kW\nCOP = 4\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 4."
