    "message_2": "To determine the density of the object, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force is the difference between the weight of the object in air and its weight when completely immersed in water.\n\nBuoyant force = Weight in air - Weight in water\nBuoyant force = 5 N - 4 N = 1 N\n\nNow, we know that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object. The weight of the water displaced can be calculated using the formula:\n\nWeight of water displaced = Volume of water displaced × Density of water × g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²) and the density of water is 1000 kg/m³.\n\nSince the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced, we have:\n\n1 N = Volume of water displaced × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of water displaced:\n\nVolume of water displaced = 1 N / (1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s²) ≈ 0.000102 m³\n\nThe volume of the object is equal to the volume of water displaced, so the volume of the object is 0.000102 m³.\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the object. We can use the formula:\n\nWeight = Mass × g\n\nRearranging for mass, we get:\n\nMass = Weight / g = 5 N / 9.81 m/s² ≈ 0.509 kg\n\nFinally, we can find the density of the object using the formula:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\nDensity = 0.509 kg / 0.000102 m³ ≈ 4985 kg/m³\n\nSo, the density of the object is approximately 4985 kg/m³."
