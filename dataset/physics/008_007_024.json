    "message_2": "To determine the mass of the W boson, we can use the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere p is the momentum, m is the mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the momentum (p) and the velocity (v), and we need to solve for the mass (m). Rearranging the formula to solve for m, we get:\n\nm = (p * sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))) / v\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nm_W = (3.2 x 10^-18 kg m/s * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)) / 0.8c\n\nm_W = (3.2 x 10^-18 kg m/s * sqrt(1 - 0.64)) / 0.8c\n\nm_W = (3.2 x 10^-18 kg m/s * sqrt(0.36)) / 0.8c\n\nm_W = (3.2 x 10^-18 kg m/s * 0.6) / 0.8c\n\nm_W = 1.92 x 10^-18 kg m/s / 0.8c\n\nm_W = 2.4 x 10^-18 kg m/s / c\n\nNow, we are asked to find the mass of a Z boson with the same velocity and momentum. Since the velocity and momentum are the same, the mass of the Z boson will be the same as the mass of the W boson.\n\nm_Z = m_W = 2.4 x 10^-18 kg m/s / c\n\nSo, the mass of the W boson is 2.4 x 10^-18 kg m/s / c, and the mass of the Z boson is also 2.4 x 10^-18 kg m/s / c."
