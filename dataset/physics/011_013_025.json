    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity, we first need to find the resistance of the copper wire. We can use the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = (Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L)) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nGiven:\nResistivity (ρ) = 1.7 x 10^-8 Ω•m\nLength (L) = 120 m\nCross-sectional Area (A) = 1.5 mm² = 1.5 x 10^-6 m² (converting to square meters)\n\nNow, let's calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.7 x 10^-8 Ω•m × 120 m) / (1.5 x 10^-6 m²)\nR = (2.04 x 10^-6 Ω•m²) / (1.5 x 10^-6 m²)\nR ≈ 1.36 Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nHowever, we need to take into account the potential difference (V) and the length (L) of the wire. We can use Ohm's Law to find the current (I) flowing through the wire:\n\nV = IR\nI = V / R\n\nGiven:\nPotential difference (V) = 2.5 V\nResistance (R) = 1.36 Ω\n\nCalculating the current:\n\nI = 2.5 V / 1.36 Ω\nI ≈ 1.838 A\n\nNow, we can use the current (I) and the potential difference (V) to find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nσ = I / (V × A)\n\nGiven:\nCurrent (I) = 1.838 A\nPotential difference (V) = 2.5 V\nCross-sectional Area (A) = 1.5 x 10^-6 m²\n\nCalculating the electrical conductivity:\n\nσ = 1.838 A / (2.5 V × 1.5 x 10^-6 m²)\nσ ≈ 4.9 x 10^5 S/m\n\nTherefore, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 4.9 x 10^5 S/m."
