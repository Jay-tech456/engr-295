    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of interference fringes that can be observed on a screen, we need to calculate the angular separation between the fringes and then determine how many fringes can fit within the angular range that corresponds to the screen size.\n\nThe angular separation between the fringes (θ) can be calculated using the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = m * (λ / d)\n\nwhere m is the order of the fringe (0 for the central maximum, ±1 for the first-order maxima, ±2 for the second-order maxima, and so on), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the slit separation.\n\nIn this case, λ = 600 nm = 6 * 10^(-7) m and d = 0.2 mm = 2 * 10^(-4) m.\n\nFor the maximum angle (θ_max), we can assume that sin(θ_max) ≈ 1, which corresponds to the highest possible order of the fringe (m_max) that can be observed:\n\n1 = m_max * (6 * 10^(-7) m / 2 * 10^(-4) m)\n\nm_max = 1 / (6 * 10^(-7) m / 2 * 10^(-4) m) = 333.33\n\nSince m_max is the highest order of the fringe, we need to consider both the positive and negative orders of the fringes. Therefore, the total number of fringes (N) that can be observed is:\n\nN = 2 * m_max + 1 (for the central maximum)\n\nN = 2 * 333 + 1 = 667\n\nSo, the maximum number of interference fringes that can be observed on the screen is 667."
