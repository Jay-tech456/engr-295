    "message_2": "The absorption spectrum of a metal is influenced by various factors, including temperature. As the temperature of a metal changes, its absorption spectrum can be affected in several ways:\n\n1. Thermal expansion: As the temperature of a metal increases, it undergoes thermal expansion, causing the lattice structure to expand. This expansion can lead to changes in the electronic band structure and the density of states, which in turn can affect the absorption spectrum.\n\n2. Electron-phonon coupling: At higher temperatures, the vibrational energy of the metal lattice (phonons) increases. This can lead to stronger electron-phonon coupling, which can cause broadening and shifting of the absorption peaks.\n\n3. Free electron density: The number of free electrons in a metal can change with temperature. As temperature increases, more electrons can be excited from the valence band to the conduction band, increasing the free electron density. This can affect the absorption spectrum, as the interaction between photons and free electrons is responsible for the absorption of light in metals.\n\n4. Drude response: Metals exhibit a characteristic absorption behavior known as the Drude response, which is related to the free electron density and the electron scattering rate. As temperature increases, the scattering rate of electrons can increase due to increased phonon scattering, leading to changes in the Drude response and the absorption spectrum.\n\n5. Interband transitions: In some metals, absorption can also occur due to electronic transitions between different energy bands. The probability of these transitions can be temperature-dependent, leading to changes in the absorption spectrum with temperature.\n\nIn summary, the absorption spectrum of a metal can change with temperature due to various factors such as thermal expansion, electron-phonon coupling, changes in free electron density, Drude response, and interband transitions. The specific changes in the absorption spectrum will depend on the particular metal and the temperature range being considered."
