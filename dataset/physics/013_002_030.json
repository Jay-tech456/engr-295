    "message_2": "A star with a mass of 20 times the mass of our Sun is considered a massive star. The final fate of such a star is to undergo a core-collapse supernova, ultimately leaving behind either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the remaining mass after the explosion.\n\nDuring its lifetime, the star will go through several stages of nuclear fusion in its core. Initially, it will fuse hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain or CNO cycle. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted, the core contracts and heats up, allowing for the next stage of fusion to occur.\n\nThe star will then start fusing helium into carbon and oxygen through the triple-alpha process. As the helium gets depleted, the core contracts further and heats up again, allowing for even heavier elements to be synthesized. The star will go through successive stages of fusion, creating elements such as neon, magnesium, silicon, and sulfur.\n\nFinally, the core will start fusing silicon into iron. However, iron fusion is not energetically favorable, and the core will no longer generate enough energy to support the outer layers of the star. This leads to a core-collapse supernova, where the outer layers of the star are ejected into space, and the core collapses under its own gravity, forming either a neutron star or a black hole."
