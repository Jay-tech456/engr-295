    "message_2": "The Joule-Thomson coefficient (μ) is a measure of how the temperature of a gas changes as it undergoes an isenthalpic (constant enthalpy) expansion or compression. It is defined as:\n\nμ = (∂T/∂P)_H\n\nwhere T is the temperature, P is the pressure, and H is the enthalpy.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the initial and final pressures (P1 and P2) and temperatures (T1 and T2) of the gas. We can use these values to calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient:\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 15°C - 20°C = -5°C\nΔP = P2 - P1 = 1.5 atm - 2 atm = -0.5 atm\n\nNow, we can find the Joule-Thomson coefficient:\n\nμ = (ΔT/ΔP) = (-5°C) / (-0.5 atm) = 10 °C/atm\n\nThe Joule-Thomson coefficient for this gas is 10 °C/atm."
