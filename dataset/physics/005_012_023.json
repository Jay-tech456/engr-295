    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy of an electron accelerated to a velocity of 0.5c, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor, which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron. In this case, v = 0.5c, so we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ ≈ 1.155\n\nNow we can find the relativistic kinetic energy using the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nThe mass of an electron is approximately 9.11 × 10^-31 kg, and the speed of light is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nK = (1.155 - 1) * (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 0.155 * (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) * (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 1.27 × 10^-17 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the electron is approximately 1.27 × 10^-17 Joules."
