    "message_2": "The relationship between the masses of two merging black holes and the resulting amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced can be described using the framework of General Relativity and the concept of chirp mass.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) is proportional to the chirp mass (M) and inversely proportional to the distance (D) between the source of the waves and the observer:\n\nh ∝ M^(5/3) / D\n\nThe chirp mass is a combination of the masses of the two merging black holes (m1 and m2) and is given by:\n\nM = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves (f) is related to the chirp mass and the time remaining before the merger (t) as:\n\nf ∝ M^(-5/8) * t^(-3/8)\n\nAs the black holes get closer to each other, the frequency of the gravitational waves increases, leading to the characteristic \"chirp\" sound in the gravitational wave signal. The amplitude of the gravitational waves also increases as the black holes get closer, reaching its maximum value at the time of the merger.\n\nIn summary, the masses of the two merging black holes determine the chirp mass, which in turn affects the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced. The amplitude is proportional to the chirp mass and inversely proportional to the distance from the observer, while the frequency is related to the chirp mass and the time remaining before the merger."
