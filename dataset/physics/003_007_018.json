    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a point 10 cm from the rod, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying conductor is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the conductor (3 A)\n- r is the distance from the conductor (0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T) / (2 × 10^(-1))\nB = 6 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point 10 cm from the rod is 6 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
