    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a long straight rod carrying a current of 2.5 A at an angle of 30 degrees to the rod? The rod has a length of 1.2 meters and is made of copper. (Assume permeability of free space is 4π × 10^-7 Tm/A)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a long straight rod carrying a current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight conductor, which is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current (2.5 A), and r is the distance from the rod (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nHowever, since the observation point is at an angle of 30 degrees to the rod, we need to find the perpendicular distance from the rod to the observation point. We can use trigonometry to find this distance:\n\nr_perpendicular = r * sin(30) = 0.05 m * sin(30) = 0.05 m * 0.5 = 0.025 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Biot-Savart law formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.025 m)\n\nB = (10^-6 T * 2.5) / (0.05)\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the long straight rod carrying a current of 2.5 A at an angle of 30 degrees to the rod is 2.5 × 10^-5 T (Tesla)."
