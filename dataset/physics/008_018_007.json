    "message_2": "The method used to measure the strong coupling constant (αs) with high precision in recent experiments conducted by CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is based on the analysis of high-energy proton-proton collisions. One of the key techniques used in these measurements is the study of events with jets, which are sprays of particles produced by the strong force.\n\nThe ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have performed precise measurements of the strong coupling constant using various methods. One such method is the analysis of the production rates of jets with different transverse momenta (pT) in proton-proton collisions. By comparing the measured jet production rates with theoretical predictions, which depend on the value of αs, the strong coupling constant can be extracted.\n\nAnother method involves studying the production of top quark-antiquark pairs, which are also sensitive to the strong coupling constant. By measuring the production cross-section of these pairs and comparing it to theoretical predictions, the value of αs can be determined.\n\nAdditionally, the strong coupling constant can be measured by analyzing the production of Z and W bosons in association with jets. These electroweak processes are sensitive to the strong force, and by measuring their production rates, the value of αs can be extracted.\n\nThese measurements are then combined with other experimental results and theoretical calculations to obtain a more precise value of the strong coupling constant. The LHC experiments have significantly improved the precision of αs measurements, contributing to a better understanding of the strong force and the fundamental interactions in the universe."
