    "message_2": "There is substantial evidence for the existence of dark matter, which is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. Dark matter is believed to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. The evidence for dark matter comes from various observations and phenomena that cannot be explained by the presence of ordinary matter alone. Some of these observations include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter surrounding the galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, is another evidence for dark matter. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass of these objects, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass in the form of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal patterns that can only be explained by the presence of dark matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide direct evidence for dark matter. Observations show that the majority of the mass in the clusters, as determined by gravitational lensing, is separated from the visible gas and stars, indicating the presence of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is not accounted for in the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. The existence of dark matter suggests that there is new physics beyond the Standard Model. Several theoretical candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos. These particles are not part of the Standard Model and their discovery would represent a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. Experiments are currently underway to directly detect dark matter particles or to produce them in particle accelerators, which could provide further insights into the nature of dark matter and its connection to Beyond the Standard Model physics."
