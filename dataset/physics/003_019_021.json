    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 mm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (circumferential direction), and its magnitude is constant at a given radial distance. Therefore, we can rewrite Ampere's law as:\n\nB⋅2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nwhere r is the radial distance from the center of the cable, and I_enclosed is the current enclosed by the loop at that radial distance.\n\nSince the radial distance is 3 mm (0.003 m), which is between the inner and outer conductors, the loop only encloses the current in the inner conductor, which is 10 A. Therefore, I_enclosed = 10 A.\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB⋅2π(0.003 m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)⋅(10 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)⋅(10 A) / (2π(0.003 m))\n\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.003 m)\n\nB ≈ 6.67 × 10^(-4) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 mm from the center of the coaxial cable is approximately 6.67 × 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
