    "message_2": "The piezoelectric coefficient of quartz crystal is a measure of the material's ability to generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress. The piezoelectric coefficients for quartz are usually represented as d11, d14, and d36, with d11 and d14 being the most commonly used. The values for these coefficients are:\n\n- d11 ≈ 2.3 pC/N (picocoulombs per newton)\n- d14 ≈ -0.67 pC/N\n- d36 ≈ 0.5 pC/N\n\nThe piezoelectric coefficient of quartz crystal can vary with temperature. The temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficients is typically non-linear and can be affected by various factors such as crystal orientation, impurities, and defects. However, the general trend is that the piezoelectric coefficients decrease with increasing temperature.\n\nTo determine the temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient experimentally, one can perform a series of measurements at different temperatures. This can be done using a piezoelectric force sensor or a piezoelectric actuator, where the generated charge or displacement is measured as a function of applied stress or electric field, respectively. By comparing the results at different temperatures, the temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient can be determined.\n\nIt is important to note that the temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient is just one factor that can affect the performance of a piezoelectric device. Other factors, such as mechanical stress, humidity, and aging, can also influence the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystal."
