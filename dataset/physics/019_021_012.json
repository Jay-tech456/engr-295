    "message_2": "In bosonic string theory, the scattering amplitude of two open strings with four external states each at tree level can be calculated using the Veneziano amplitude. The Veneziano amplitude is given by:\n\nA(s,t) = Γ(-α(s))Γ(-α(t)) / Γ(1 - α(s) - α(t))\n\nwhere s and t are Mandelstam variables, and α is the Regge trajectory function, which is defined as:\n\nα(x) = 1 + x / (2πα')\n\nHere, α' is the Regge slope parameter, which is related to the string tension.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this amplitude is that it describes the probability amplitude for the scattering of two open strings with four external states each at tree level. In other words, it represents the probability amplitude for two open strings to interact and exchange closed strings in the process, without any loops (which would correspond to higher-order interactions).\n\nThe Veneziano amplitude has some interesting properties, such as duality between the s-channel and t-channel processes, which means that it can describe both the scattering of two open strings and the decay of a closed string into two open strings. Additionally, the amplitude has poles corresponding to the masses of an infinite tower of resonances, which can be interpreted as the excited states of the string. This feature is a characteristic of string theory and distinguishes it from point particle theories."
