    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak force, unlike the known active neutrinos (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos). They are suggested as a possible constituent of dark matter due to their potential to have non-zero mass and only interact through gravity.\n\nThe theoretical range of masses for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is quite broad, spanning from sub-eV (electronvolt) to several keV (kilo-electronvolt) scales. The lighter sterile neutrinos (sub-eV to eV) are often referred to as \"warm dark matter,\" while the heavier ones (keV) are called \"cold dark matter.\"\n\nThe current experimental constraints on the mass range of sterile neutrinos come from various sources, including cosmological observations, laboratory experiments, and astrophysical data.\n\n1. Cosmological observations: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and large-scale structure (LSS) data provide constraints on the mass and mixing of sterile neutrinos. These observations typically set an upper limit on the mass of sterile neutrinos in the sub-eV to eV range.\n\n2. Laboratory experiments: Neutrino oscillation experiments, such as the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and MiniBooNE, have searched for sterile neutrinos by looking for anomalies in the oscillation patterns of active neutrinos. These experiments have provided some hints of sterile neutrinos in the eV mass range, but the results are not yet conclusive.\n\n3. Astrophysical data: X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies can be used to search for the decay of keV-scale sterile neutrinos into photons. So far, no clear signal has been observed, and the current constraints set an upper limit on the mass of sterile neutrinos in the keV range.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is broad, from sub-eV to keV scales. Current experimental constraints from cosmology, laboratory experiments, and astrophysics have not yet conclusively detected sterile neutrinos but have provided upper limits on their mass in the sub-eV to keV range. Further experiments and observations are needed to either confirm or rule out the existence of sterile neutrinos as a dark matter constituent."
