    "message_1": "A spaceship is travelling toward Earth at a velocity of 0.8c (where c is the speed of light). The length of the spaceship when at rest is 80 meters. What is the length of the spaceship according to an observer on Earth? Take the value of c as 3 x 10^8 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. According to this concept, the length of an object moving at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light) appears shorter to an observer at rest relative to the object. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length at rest), v is the velocity of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n\nL0 = 80 meters\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * 3 * 10^8 m/s = 2.4 * 10^8 m/s\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the length contraction formula:\n\nL = 80 * sqrt(1 - (2.4 * 10^8)^2 / (3 * 10^8)^2)\n\nL = 80 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 80 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 80 * 0.6\n\nL = 48 meters\n\nSo, according to an observer on Earth, the length of the spaceship appears to be 48 meters."
