Calculate the dielectric constant of the crystal at room temperature (300 K).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the dielectric constant of the crystal, we need to find the polarizability of the atoms in the unit cell. The polarizability (α) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (e^2) / (m * ω^2)\n\nwhere e is the charge of an electron, m is the mass of an electron, and ω is the angular frequency of the simple harmonic oscillator.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given frequency (ν) to angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = 2 * π * ν\n\nω = 2 * π * (5.5 x 10^12 Hz)\nω ≈ 3.455 x 10^13 rad/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the polarizability:\n\nα = (e^2) / (m * ω^2)\n\nwhere e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C (charge of an electron) and m = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg (mass of an electron).\n\nα ≈ (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * (3.455 x 10^13 rad/s)^2)\nα ≈ 1.77 x 10^-40 C^2m^2/kg\n\nNext, we need to find the number of atoms in the unit cell of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. In an FCC lattice, there are 8 corner atoms (each contributing 1/8 to the unit cell) and 6 face atoms (each contributing 1/2 to the unit cell). So, the total number of atoms in the unit cell is:\n\nN = 8 * (1/8) + 6 * (1/2)\nN = 1 + 3\nN = 4\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell:\n\nV = a^3\n\nwhere a is the lattice parameter.\n\nV = (5.8 x 10^-10 m)^3\nV ≈ 1.95 x 10^-28 m^3\n\nThe electronic polarizability per unit volume is given by:\n\nPolarizability/volume = N * α / V\n\nPolarizability/volume ≈ 4 * (1.77 x 10^-40 C^2m^2/kg) / (1.95 x 10^-28 m^3)\nPolarizability/volume ≈ 3.63 x 10^-12 C^2m/kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the dielectric constant (ε) using the Clausius-Mossotti equation:\n\nε = 1 + 4 * π * (Polarizability/volume)\n\nε ≈ 1 + 4 * π * (3.63 x 10^-12 C^2m/kg)\nε ≈ 1 + 45.6 x 10^-12\nε ≈ 1 + 0.0000456\nε ≈ 1.0000456\n\nThe dielectric constant of the crystal at room temperature (300 K) is approximately 1.0000456."
