    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic momentum and energy of the particle, we need to use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p) formula: p = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n2. Relativistic energy (E) formula: E = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic momentum:\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * 3 * 10^8 m/s = 2.4 * 10^8 m/s\n\np = (2 kg * 2.4 * 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (2.4 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2)\np = (4.8 * 10^8 kg*m/s) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = (4.8 * 10^8 kg*m/s) / sqrt(0.36)\np = (4.8 * 10^8 kg*m/s) / 0.6\np ≈ 8 * 10^8 kg*m/s\n\nNow, let's find the relativistic energy:\n\nE = 2 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (2.4 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2)\nE = 2 kg * 9 * 10^16 J/kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE = 18 * 10^16 J / sqrt(0.36)\nE = 18 * 10^16 J / 0.6\nE ≈ 30 * 10^16 J\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the particle is approximately 8 * 10^8 kg*m/s, and the relativistic energy is approximately 30 * 10^16 J."
