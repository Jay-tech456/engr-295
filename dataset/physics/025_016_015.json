    "message_2": "The maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the oxidation of glucose through the metabolic pathway of respiration, assuming standard physiological conditions, is approximately 38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. This is an estimate since the actual number of ATP molecules produced can vary depending on the efficiency of the cellular processes involved. The breakdown of glucose through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation results in the production of ATP, which is the primary energy currency of the cell."
