    "message_2": "The maximum energy that a cosmic ray particle can have when it enters the Earth's atmosphere is on the order of 10^20 electron volts (eV). These extremely high-energy cosmic rays are quite rare, with only a few observed per square kilometer per century. Most cosmic rays have much lower energies, typically around 10^9 eV.\n\nCosmic rays can affect electronic equipment, particularly in space where there is less protection from the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. When a high-energy cosmic ray particle interacts with electronic components, it can cause a variety of issues, including:\n\n1. Single Event Effects (SEE): These are caused by a single cosmic ray particle interacting with a sensitive region of an electronic device, potentially causing a bit flip, latch-up, or burnout. Bit flips can lead to data corruption, while latch-ups and burnouts can cause permanent damage to the device.\n\n2. Total Ionizing Dose (TID): This is the cumulative effect of ionizing radiation on electronic components over time. TID can cause gradual degradation of the performance of electronic devices and eventually lead to failure.\n\n3. Displacement Damage: High-energy particles can displace atoms in the crystal lattice of semiconductor materials, causing defects that can degrade the performance of electronic devices.\n\nTo mitigate these effects, engineers design electronic systems for space applications with radiation-hardened components and shielding. Additionally, error detection and correction techniques are employed to identify and correct bit flips in data storage and communication systems. Despite these precautions, cosmic rays can still occasionally cause disruptions in satellite operations and communication systems."
