    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality, is a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories: a gravitational theory in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on the boundary of that AdS space. In this problem, we are asked to calculate the entropy of a black hole in (3+1)-dimensional AdS space and its dual CFT in (2+1)-dimensions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the black hole in AdS space. The metric for a (3+1)-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole is given by:\n\nds² = -f(r) dt² + dr²/f(r) + r² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²),\n\nwhere f(r) = 1 - (2M/r) + (r²/L²), M is the mass of the black hole, and L is the AdS curvature radius.\n\nThe event horizon of the black hole is located at the largest root r_h of the equation f(r) = 0. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole is given by:\n\nS_BH = (Area of the event horizon) / (4 * Planck length²).\n\nThe area of the event horizon is given by A = 4πr_h². Therefore, the entropy of the black hole is:\n\nS_BH = (4πr_h²) / (4 * Planck length²).\n\nNow, let's consider the dual CFT in (2+1)-dimensions. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the entropy of the black hole is equal to the entropy of the dual CFT at a temperature T. The temperature of the black hole is given by:\n\nT = (1 / (4πr_h)) * (1 - (r_h² / L²)).\n\nThe central charge of the dual CFT, denoted by c, is related to the AdS curvature radius L and the (3+1)-dimensional Newton's constant G_N by:\n\nc = (3L / (2 * G_N * Planck length)).\n\nThe Cardy formula gives the entropy of the CFT in terms of its temperature T and central charge c:\n\nS_CFT = (π²/3) * c * T.\n\nUsing the expressions for T and c, we can write the entropy of the CFT as:\n\nS_CFT = (π²/3) * (3L / (2 * G_N * Planck length)) * (1 / (4πr_h)) * (1 - (r_h² / L²)).\n\nNow, according to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the entropies of the black hole and the dual CFT should be equal:\n\nS_BH = S_CFT.\n\nBy equating the expressions for S_BH and S_CFT, we can verify that the entropies are indeed equal:\n\n(4πr_h²) / (4 * Planck length²) = (π²/3) * (3L / (2 * G_N * Planck length)) * (1 / (4πr_h)) * (1 - (r_h² / L²)).\n\nThis equation confirms the AdS/CFT correspondence for the entropy of a black hole in (3+1)-dimensional AdS space and its dual CFT in (2+1)-dimensions."
