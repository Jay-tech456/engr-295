    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combined gas law and the formula for work done during an isothermal process.\n\nThe combined gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial volume (V1) using the given information:\n\nn = 2 mol\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (ideal gas constant)\nT = 300 K\nP2 = 8 atm = 8 * 101.325 kPa = 810.6 kPa (converting atm to kPa)\nV2 = 0.02 m³\n\nWe can rearrange the combined gas law to find the initial pressure (P1):\n\nP1 = nRT / V1\n\nWe also know that the final pressure (P2) and volume (V2) are related to the initial pressure (P1) and volume (V1) by the isothermal process:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for P1 from the combined gas law into the isothermal process equation:\n\n(nRT / V1) * V1 = P2V2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nnRT = P2V2\n\nNow we can solve for the initial volume (V1):\n\nV1 = nRT / P2 = (2 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(300 K) / (810.6 kPa)\n\nV1 = 4.96 m³\n\nNow that we have the initial volume, we can calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal process. The formula for work done during an isothermal process is:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(V2 / V1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, ln is the natural logarithm, and V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes, respectively.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nW = -(2 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(300 K) * ln(0.02 m³ / 4.96 m³)\n\nW = -4987.2 J * ln(0.00403)\n\nW ≈ -4987.2 J * (-5.51)\n\nW ≈ 27462 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during this process is approximately 27,462 J."
