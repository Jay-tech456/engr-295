    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom when it is in the n=4 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (Z=1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n=4 in this case).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 4^2)\nE_4 = -13.6 eV * (1 / 16)\nE_4 = -0.85 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom when it is in the n=4 energy level is approximately -0.85 electron volts (eV)."
