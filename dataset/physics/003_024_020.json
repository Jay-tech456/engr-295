    "message_1": "A current-carrying inductor has an inductance of 2 H and carries a current of 3 A. What is the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the inductor?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the inductor, we need to know the geometry of the inductor. The magnetic field strength depends on the shape and size of the inductor, such as whether it is a solenoid, toroid, or a simple loop.\n\nPlease provide more information about the geometry of the inductor."
