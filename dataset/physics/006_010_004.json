    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of deflection for an alpha particle undergoing Rutherford scattering, we can use the formula for the scattering angle θ:\n\nθ = 2 * arctan(Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (2 * π * ε₀ * b * E))\n\nwhere:\nθ is the scattering angle\nZ₁ and Z₂ are the charges of the interacting particles (in this case, Z₁ = 2 for the alpha particle and Z₂ = 79 for the gold nucleus)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/Nm²)\nb is the impact parameter (1.0 x 10^-13 m)\nE is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle (4.0 MeV, which is 4.0 x 10^6 eV or 6.4 x 10^-13 J)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nθ = 2 * arctan((2 * 79 * (1.602 x 10^-19)²) / (2 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12) * (1.0 x 10^-13) * (6.4 x 10^-13)))\n\nθ = 2 * arctan((2 * 79 * (1.602 x 10^-19)²) / (2 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12) * (1.0 x 10^-13) * (6.4 x 10^-13)))\n\nθ ≈ 2 * arctan(0.000131)\n\nθ ≈ 2 * 0.131\n\nθ ≈ 0.262 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor (180°/π):\n\nθ ≈ 0.262 * (180°/π) ≈ 15.0°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of deflection for the alpha particle is approximately 15.0°."
