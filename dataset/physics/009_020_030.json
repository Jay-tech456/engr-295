    "message_1": "A diffraction grating with 2500 lines per centimeter is illuminated with white light. What is the angle between the first-order maxima of red light and violet light?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the diffraction grating formula:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the diffraction grating, θ is the angle of the maxima, m is the order of the maxima, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the diffraction grating (d). Since there are 2500 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 2500 lines/cm = 1 / 2500 cm/line = 1 / (2500 * 10^4) m/line = 4 * 10^-6 m/line\n\nNext, we need to find the wavelengths of red and violet light. The wavelength of red light is approximately 700 nm, and the wavelength of violet light is approximately 400 nm. We need to convert these values to meters:\n\nλ_red = 700 * 10^-9 m\nλ_violet = 400 * 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can use the diffraction grating formula to find the angles for the first-order maxima (m = 1) of red and violet light:\n\nFor red light:\nd * sin(θ_red) = 1 * λ_red\nsin(θ_red) = λ_red / d\nθ_red = arcsin(λ_red / d)\n\nFor violet light:\nd * sin(θ_violet) = 1 * λ_violet\nsin(θ_violet) = λ_violet / d\nθ_violet = arcsin(λ_violet / d)\n\nFinally, we can find the angle between the first-order maxima of red and violet light:\n\nΔθ = θ_red - θ_violet\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nθ_red = arcsin((700 * 10^-9) / (4 * 10^-6)) ≈ 10.19°\nθ_violet = arcsin((400 * 10^-9) / (4 * 10^-6)) ≈ 5.74°\n\nΔθ = 10.19° - 5.74° ≈ 4.45°\n\nSo, the angle between the first-order maxima of red and violet light is approximately 4.45°."
