    "message_2": "To calculate the required power input for the plasma thruster, we can use the following equation:\n\nPower = (Thrust × Exhaust Velocity) / (2 × Efficiency)\n\nwhere\nThrust = 0.1 N (specific thrust)\nExhaust Velocity = 40 km/s = 40,000 m/s\nEfficiency = 60% = 0.6\n\nFirst, let's calculate the product of thrust and exhaust velocity:\n\nThrust × Exhaust Velocity = 0.1 N × 40,000 m/s = 4,000 Nm/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the power:\n\nPower = (4,000 Nm/s) / (2 × 0.6) = 4,000 Nm/s / 1.2 = 3,333.33 W\n\nTherefore, the required power input to operate the plasma thruster is approximately 3,333.33 watts."
