    "message_2": "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the highest critical temperature of a superconductor that has been synthesized is around 203 Kelvin (-70°C or -94°F). This record was achieved in 2015 by a team of researchers led by Mikhail Eremets at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany.\n\nThe material used to achieve this high critical temperature is a hydrogen sulfide compound (H2S) under extremely high pressure. The researchers subjected the hydrogen sulfide to pressures of around 150 gigapascals (approximately 1.5 million times the atmospheric pressure at sea level) to create a superconducting phase. At this pressure, the hydrogen sulfide is transformed into a metallic state, which exhibits superconductivity at the mentioned temperature.\n\nIt is important to note that research in the field of superconductivity is ongoing, and new materials and methods are continually being explored to achieve higher critical temperatures and more practical applications."
