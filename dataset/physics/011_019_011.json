    "message_2": "To calculate the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (β), we can use the relationship between linear thermal expansion coefficient (α) and volumetric thermal expansion coefficient for a cubic crystal:\n\nβ = 3α\n\nGiven that the linear thermal expansion coefficient (α) is 3.5 × 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$, we can calculate the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (β) as follows:\n\nβ = 3 × (3.5 × 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$) = 10.5 × 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$\n\nNow, we need to find the increase in volume of the crystal when it is heated from 300 K to 400 K. We can use the formula for the change in volume due to thermal expansion:\n\nΔV = V₀ × β × ΔT\n\nwhere ΔV is the change in volume, V₀ is the initial volume, β is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven that the initial volume (V₀) is 20 nm$^3$, the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (β) is 10.5 × 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is 400 K - 300 K = 100 K, we can calculate the change in volume (ΔV) as follows:\n\nΔV = (20 nm$^3$) × (10.5 × 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$) × (100 K) = 21 × 10$^{-3}$ nm$^3$\n\nSo, the increase in volume of the crystal when it is heated from 300 K to 400 K is 21 × 10$^{-3}$ nm$^3$."
