    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection in an optical fiber, we need to consider the refractive index of the core (n1) and the refractive index of the cladding (n2). In this case, we are given the refractive index of the core (n1 = 1.5), but we do not have the refractive index of the cladding (n2). \n\nHowever, I can provide you with the general formula to find the critical angle (θc) for total internal reflection:\n\nθc = arcsin(n2/n1)\n\nOnce you have the refractive index of the cladding (n2), you can plug it into this formula along with the given refractive index of the core (n1 = 1.5) to find the critical angle. The minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection will be greater than this critical angle."
