    "message_1": "A long wire with a resistance of 2 ohms carries a current of 3A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 3 A and r = 4 cm = 0.04 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm * 3) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.08 m)\n\nB = 1.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is 1.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
