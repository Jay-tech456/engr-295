    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the particle, we will use the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity in m/s:\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nm = 1 kg / sqrt(1 - (2.4 x 10^8 m/s)^2/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nm = 1 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm = 1 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm = 1 kg / 0.6\n\nm â‰ˆ 1.67 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the particle is approximately 1.67 kg."
