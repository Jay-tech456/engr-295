    "message_2": "To find the focal length of the convex lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nWe are given that the image is twice the size of the object. Therefore, the magnification (M) is 2. The magnification formula for a lens is:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nSince M = 2, we have:\n\n2 = -v/u\n\nWe are also given that the image is located 40 cm from the lens, so v = 40 cm. Now we can find the distance of the object from the lens (u):\n\n2 = -40/u\nu = -20 cm\n\nNote that the negative sign indicates that the object is on the opposite side of the lens, which is not possible in this case. However, we will continue with the calculation to find the focal length.\n\nNow we can use the lens formula to find the focal length (f):\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n1/f = 1/40 - 1/(-20)\n1/f = 1/40 + 1/20\n1/f = (1+2)/40\n1/f = 3/40\n\nNow, find the focal length (f):\n\nf = 40/3\nf â‰ˆ 13.33 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the convex lens is approximately 13.33 cm."
