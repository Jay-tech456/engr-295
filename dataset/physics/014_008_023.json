    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. They constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere, where they interact with air molecules and produce secondary particles. The sources of cosmic rays can be classified into three main categories: solar, galactic, and extragalactic. Each of these sources differs in their composition and energy spectrum.\n\n1. Solar cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from the Sun, particularly during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar cosmic rays are primarily composed of protons, electrons, and alpha particles (helium nuclei). They have relatively low energies, typically ranging from a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to a few hundred MeV (mega-electron volts). Due to their lower energies, solar cosmic rays are more easily deflected by the Earth's magnetic field and are less likely to reach the ground.\n\n2. Galactic cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from within our Milky Way galaxy and are produced by various astrophysical processes, such as supernova explosions, pulsars, and the acceleration of particles in the interstellar medium. Galactic cosmic rays have a much wider range of energies, from a few MeV to several EeV (exa-electron volts). They are primarily composed of protons (about 90%) and alpha particles (about 9%), with the remaining 1% consisting of heavier atomic nuclei and a small fraction of electrons. The energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays follows a power-law distribution, with the number of particles decreasing as the energy increases.\n\n3. Extragalactic cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from sources outside our galaxy, such as active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and other powerful astrophysical phenomena. Extragalactic cosmic rays have the highest energies, reaching up to several ZeV (zetta-electron volts) in extreme cases. Their composition is not well understood, but they are thought to be primarily composed of protons and atomic nuclei. The energy spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays is also believed to follow a power-law distribution, similar to galactic cosmic rays.\n\nIn summary, the possible sources of cosmic rays include solar, galactic, and extragalactic sources. Solar cosmic rays have the lowest energies and are primarily composed of protons, electrons, and alpha particles. Galactic cosmic rays have a wider range of energies and are predominantly composed of protons and alpha particles, with a small fraction of heavier nuclei and electrons. Extragalactic cosmic rays have the highest energies and are thought to be primarily composed of protons and atomic nuclei. The energy spectra of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays follow a power-law distribution, with fewer particles at higher energies."
