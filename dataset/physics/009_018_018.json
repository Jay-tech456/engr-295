    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 500 nm is passed through a double-slit with a separation of 0.1 mm. The screen is located 2 meters away from the double-slit. If the interference pattern from the double-slit has a maximum intensity at an angle of 30 degrees with the central axis, what is the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular separation of bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angular separation, m is the order of the fringe (an integer), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the separation between the slits.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 5 * 10^(-7) m\nd = 0.1 mm = 1 * 10^(-4) m\nθ = 30 degrees = (30 * π) / 180 radians ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nNow we can solve for m:\n\nm = (θ * d) / λ\nm ≈ (0.5236 * 1 * 10^(-4)) / (5 * 10^(-7))\nm ≈ 1.0472\n\nSince m must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is m = 1.\n\nNow that we have the order of the fringe, we can find the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen. We can use the formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance between adjacent bright fringes, L is the distance between the double-slit and the screen, and the other variables are as defined before.\n\nL = 2 m\n\ny = (1 * 5 * 10^(-7) * 2) / (1 * 10^(-4))\ny = 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen is 10^(-6) meters, or 1 μm."
