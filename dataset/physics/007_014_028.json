    "message_2": "The Oxygen-17 nucleus has 8 protons and 9 neutrons. To determine the nuclear spin and parity of the ground state, we need to consider the shell model of the nucleus.\n\nIn the shell model, protons and neutrons occupy different energy levels, or shells. For Oxygen-17, the first energy level (1s1/2) can hold up to 2 protons and 2 neutrons, while the second energy level (1p3/2) can hold up to 4 protons and 4 neutrons. The third energy level (1p1/2) can hold up to 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\nFor Oxygen-17, the first two energy levels are completely filled with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The last neutron occupies the 1p1/2 level. The 1p1/2 level has a total angular momentum (j) of 1/2.\n\nSince there is only one unpaired nucleon (the last neutron) in the Oxygen-17 nucleus, the nuclear spin (I) of the ground state is equal to the total angular momentum of the unpaired nucleon, which is 1/2.\n\nThe parity (P) of a nucleus is determined by the orbital angular momentum (l) of the unpaired nucleon. For the 1p1/2 level, the orbital angular momentum is 1. Since the parity is given by (-1)^l, the parity of Oxygen-17 is (-1)^1 = -1, which is usually denoted as negative parity.\n\nSo, the nuclear spin and parity of the ground state of Oxygen-17 nucleus are 1/2 and negative parity, respectively. This is often written as 1/2-."
