    "message_2": "The sliding filament theory explains the mechanism of muscle contraction, where the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, causing the muscle to shorten and generate force. To determine the force generated by the muscle during contraction, we need to make some assumptions.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The muscle is contracting isometrically, meaning the muscle length remains constant during contraction.\n2. The muscle is generating enough force to overcome the external resistance of 50 N.\n3. The force generated by the muscle is directly proportional to the number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin filaments.\n\nGiven the external resistance of 50 N, the muscle must generate at least 50 N of force to overcome this resistance. However, muscles typically have a safety factor, meaning they can generate more force than the minimum required to overcome the external resistance. Let's assume a safety factor of 1.5.\n\nForce generated by the muscle = External resistance × Safety factor\nForce generated by the muscle = 50 N × 1.5\nForce generated by the muscle = 75 N\n\nUsing the sliding filament theory and the given assumptions, the muscle generates a force of 75 N during contraction when subjected to an external resistance of 50 N."
