    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section for the D(d,n)3He nuclear reaction, we can use the Breit-Wigner formula for resonant reactions. The formula is given by:\n\nσ(E) = (πħ²)/(2μE) * (Γ₁Γ₂) / [(E - E_R)² + (Γ/2)²]\n\nwhere σ(E) is the cross-section at energy E, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, μ is the reduced mass of the interacting particles, Γ₁ and Γ₂ are the partial widths of the entrance and exit channels, E_R is the resonance energy, and Γ is the total width of the resonance.\n\nGiven the deuteron energy of 50 keV, we first need to convert it to MeV:\n\nE = 50 keV = 0.05 MeV\n\nNext, we need to find the reduced mass μ of the interacting particles. For the D(d,n)3He reaction, the interacting particles are deuterium (D) and deuterium (d). The mass of deuterium is approximately 2 amu (atomic mass units), so the reduced mass is:\n\nμ = (2 * 2) / (2 + 2) = 1 amu\n\nNow we need to find the partial widths Γ₁ and Γ₂. Since the relative strengths of the resonance are given as 1:2, we can assume that Γ₁ = Γ and Γ₂ = 2Γ. The total width of the resonance is then:\n\nΓ_total = Γ₁ + Γ₂ = Γ + 2Γ = 3Γ\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Breit-Wigner formula:\n\nσ(0.05 MeV) = (πħ²)/(2 * 1 amu * 0.05 MeV) * (Γ * 2Γ) / [(0.05 MeV - 5.5 MeV)² + (3Γ/2)²]\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine the values of Γ and ħ²/μ. However, if these values were provided, we could plug them into the formula and calculate the cross-section for the D(d,n)3He nuclear reaction at a deuteron energy of 50 keV."
