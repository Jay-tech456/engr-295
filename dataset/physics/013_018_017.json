    "message_2": "The average dose of cosmic ray background radiation that a human body is exposed to in one year is approximately 0.3 millisieverts (mSv). This value can vary depending on factors such as altitude, latitude, and solar activity. For instance, people living at higher altitudes or closer to the poles are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation.\n\nThe potential long-term effects of cosmic ray background radiation on human health are relatively low, as the dose is quite small compared to other sources of radiation exposure, such as medical procedures or natural background radiation from the Earth. However, long-term exposure to low levels of radiation can still slightly increase the risk of developing cancer or other radiation-related health issues. It is important to note that the overall risk remains low, and the human body has evolved to repair most of the damage caused by low levels of radiation exposure.\n\nIn summary, the average dose of cosmic ray background radiation that a human body is exposed to in one year is about 0.3 mSv, and the potential long-term effects on human health are relatively low but may include a slightly increased risk of cancer or other radiation-related health issues."
