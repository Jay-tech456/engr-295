    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula, which describes the change in wavelength of a photon after scattering off a stationary electron. The formula is:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\nΔλ is the change in wavelength,\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js),\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg),\nc is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s),\nθ is the scattering angle (60° in this case).\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60° * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/3))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2.727 x 10^(-22) Js) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ = 0.243 x 10^(-12) m\n\nSince the initial wavelength is given in Ångströms, let's convert the change in wavelength to Ångströms as well:\n\nΔλ = 0.243 x 10^(-12) m * (10^10 Å/m) = 2.43 x 10^(-3) Å\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of the X-ray photon is approximately 2.43 x 10^(-3) Å."
