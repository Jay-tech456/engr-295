    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to perform the double-slit experiment using a laser of wavelength 633 nm aimed at two slits spaced 0.25 mm apart. If the distance from the slits to the screen is 1.0 m, what is the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen? What would happen to the interference pattern if the distance between the slits is tripled?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nΔy = (λL) / d\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between adjacent bright fringes, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nGiven the values:\nλ = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\nL = 1.0 m\nd = 0.25 mm = 0.25 * 10^(-3) m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔy = (633 * 10^(-9) m * 1.0 m) / (0.25 * 10^(-3) m)\nΔy ≈ 2.532 * 10^(-3) m\n\nSo, the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen is approximately 2.532 mm.\n\nNow, let's see what happens to the interference pattern if the distance between the slits is tripled. The new distance between the slits, d', is:\n\nd' = 3 * d = 3 * 0.25 * 10^(-3) m = 0.75 * 10^(-3) m\n\nUsing the same formula for the double-slit interference pattern, we get:\n\nΔy' = (λL) / d'\nΔy' = (633 * 10^(-9) m * 1.0 m) / (0.75 * 10^(-3) m)\nΔy' ≈ 0.844 * 10^(-3) m\n\nSo, when the distance between the slits is tripled, the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen is approximately 0.844 mm.\n\nIn conclusion, when the distance between the slits is tripled, the interference pattern becomes more closely spaced, with the distance between adjacent bright fringes decreasing from 2.532 mm to 0.844 mm."
