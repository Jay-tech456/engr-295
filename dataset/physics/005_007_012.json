Calculate the age difference between the twins if one twin traveled at 0.8c (80% of the speed of light) for 5 years according to the twin paradox.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the age difference between the twins, we need to use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere:\nΔt' is the time experienced by the traveling twin (the proper time)\nΔt is the time experienced by the twin on Earth (the coordinate time)\nv is the speed of the traveling twin (0.8c)\nc is the speed of light\n\nFirst, we need to find the time dilation factor:\n\n√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = √(1 - 0.64) = √(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can find the proper time experienced by the traveling twin:\n\nΔt' = Δt / 0.6\n\nSince the twin on Earth experienced 5 years:\n\nΔt' = 5 years / 0.6 ≈ 8.33 years\n\nThe traveling twin experienced approximately 8.33 years. The age difference between the twins is:\n\nAge difference = 8.33 years - 5 years = 3.33 years\n\nSo, the twin who stayed on Earth aged 3.33 years more than the twin who traveled at 0.8c."
