    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a non-rotating black hole is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, a 10 solar mass black hole has a mass of:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius, which is also the event horizon of the non-rotating black hole, is approximately 29,500 meters or 29.5 kilometers."
