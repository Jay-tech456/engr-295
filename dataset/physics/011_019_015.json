    "message_2": "The thermal expansion coefficient of a sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal can be expressed in terms of its linear thermal expansion coefficient. The linear thermal expansion coefficient (α) is given as 23.1 x 10^-6 K^-1. \n\nTo find the volume thermal expansion coefficient (β) of the NaCl crystal, we can use the following relationship:\n\nβ = 3α\n\nSubstituting the given value of α:\n\nβ = 3 * (23.1 x 10^-6 K^-1)\nβ = 69.3 x 10^-6 K^-1\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of a sodium chloride crystal at a temperature of 293 K is 69.3 x 10^-6 K^-1."
