Specifically, how does the bulk geometry of Anti-de Sitter space correspond to the boundary quantum field theory, and what are the mathematical methods used to map between these two theories?",
    "message_2": "The holographic duality, also known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, is a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories: a quantum field theory with gravity (specifically, a string theory) and a classical theory of gravity (a conformal field theory, or CFT). The correspondence states that the string theory on an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is equivalent to a conformal field theory on the boundary of that space.\n\nThe bulk geometry of the Anti-de Sitter space is a negatively curved, Lorentzian manifold. The boundary of this space is a conformal field theory, which is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a dictionary that allows us to map between the two theories.\n\nHere are some key aspects of the correspondence:\n\n1. The partition function: The partition function of the quantum field theory on the boundary is related to the partition function of the string theory in the bulk. Specifically, the partition function of the CFT is equal to the partition function of the string theory on the AdS space.\n\n2. The correlation functions: The correlation functions of the CFT can be calculated from the correlation functions of the string theory in the bulk. This is done by taking the limit of the bulk correlation functions as the boundary is approached.\n\n3. The holographic principle: The degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory on the boundary are encoded in the degrees of freedom of the string theory in the bulk. This means that the information in the bulk theory can be described by a lower-dimensional theory on the boundary.\n\nMathematical methods used to map between the two theories include:\n\n1. The use of the holographic renormalization group (HRG) to relate the renormalization group flow of the CFT to the radial direction in the AdS space.\n\n2. The use of the GKP-Witten relation, which relates the classical action of the bulk theory to the generating functional of the CFT.\n\n3. The use of the AdS/CFT dictionary, which provides a set of rules for translating between observables in the bulk and boundary theories.\n\nIn summary, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between quantum field theories with gravity and classical theories of gravity. The correspondence allows us to map between the bulk geometry of Anti-de Sitter space and the boundary quantum field theory, providing insights into the nature of quantum gravity and the holographic principle."
