    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = γmc²\n\nwhere E is the relativistic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the particle's velocity (v = 0.6c):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can use the relativistic energy equation to find the rest mass (m) of the particle:\n\nE = γmc²\n\nWe are given the relativistic energy (E) as 5.5 MeV, which we need to convert to Joules:\n\n1 MeV = 1.60218 × 10⁻¹³ J\n\n5.5 MeV = 5.5 × 1.60218 × 10⁻¹³ J ≈ 8.812 × 10⁻¹³ J\n\nNow we can solve for the rest mass (m):\n\n8.812 × 10⁻¹³ J = (1.25)m(3 × 10⁸ m/s)²\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for m:\n\nm = (8.812 × 10⁻¹³ J) / (1.25 × (3 × 10⁸ m/s)²)\n\nm ≈ (8.812 × 10⁻¹³ J) / (1.25 × 9 × 10¹⁶ m²/s²)\n\nm ≈ 7.85 × 10⁻³¹ kg\n\nSo, the rest mass of the particle is approximately 7.85 × 10⁻³¹ kg."
