    "message_1": "What is the electrical conductivity of a copper rod of length 10 cm and cross-sectional area of 2 cm^2 at a temperature of 100 K, given that the resistivity of copper at this temperature is 1.7 x 10^-8 Ωm?",
    "message_2": "To find the electrical conductivity of the copper rod, we first need to understand the relationship between resistivity (ρ) and conductivity (σ). They are inversely related, meaning:\n\nσ = 1/ρ\n\nGiven the resistivity of copper at 100 K is 1.7 x 10^-8 Ωm, we can find the conductivity as follows:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.7 x 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.88 x 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper rod at 100 K is approximately 5.88 x 10^7 Siemens per meter (S/m)."
