    "message_2": "The quantum gravity effects on the scattering amplitudes of two gravitons in a quantum field theory are related to the interactions between gravitons, which are the hypothetical elementary particles that mediate the force of gravity in the framework of quantum field theory. These effects are important for understanding the behavior of gravity at very small distances and high energies, where classical general relativity breaks down.\n\nTo calculate these effects using perturbative techniques, one can employ the framework of perturbative quantum gravity, which is an approach to quantizing general relativity based on the principles of quantum field theory. The main idea is to treat the metric tensor, which describes the geometry of spacetime, as a sum of a classical background metric and a small quantum fluctuation. The quantum fluctuations are then quantized as gravitons.\n\nThe scattering amplitudes of two gravitons can be calculated using Feynman diagrams, which are graphical representations of the interactions between particles in a quantum field theory. In the case of graviton scattering, the diagrams involve the exchange of gravitons between the initial and final states, as well as the possible creation and annihilation of virtual particles.\n\nTo compute the scattering amplitudes, one needs to sum over all possible Feynman diagrams that contribute to the process, taking into account the corresponding amplitudes and the combinatorial factors associated with each diagram. This summation is organized as a perturbation series in the gravitational coupling constant, which is related to the Newton's constant and determines the strength of the gravitational interaction.\n\nHowever, perturbative quantum gravity faces several challenges, such as the non-renormalizability problem, which means that the perturbation series diverges and cannot be used to make precise predictions. This issue has led researchers to explore alternative approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, which aim to provide a consistent and finite description of gravity at the quantum level.\n\nIn summary, the quantum gravity effects on the scattering amplitudes of two gravitons can be calculated using perturbative techniques based on Feynman diagrams and the principles of quantum field theory. However, the perturbative approach faces significant challenges, and alternative frameworks are being explored to better understand the quantum nature of gravity."
