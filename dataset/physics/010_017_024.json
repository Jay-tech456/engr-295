    "message_1": "A steel container with a volume of 2 m³ is partially filled with water to a height of 1.5 meters. A small oscillating pump is placed inside, and it vibrates at a frequency of 10 Hz. Calculate the maximum horizontal force exerted on the walls of the container due to fluid-structure interaction. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³ and the dimensions of the container are 2 meters in length, 1.5 meters in width and 2 meters in height.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum horizontal force exerted on the walls of the container due to fluid-structure interaction, we need to find the mass of the water in the container and the acceleration of the water due to the oscillating pump.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the water in the container. Since the container is filled to a height of 1.5 meters, the volume of the water is:\n\nV_water = length * width * height\nV_water = 2 m * 1.5 m * 1.5 m\nV_water = 4.5 m³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the water:\n\nmass_water = density_water * V_water\nmass_water = 1000 kg/m³ * 4.5 m³\nmass_water = 4500 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the water due to the oscillating pump. The acceleration can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = 2 * π * f * A\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, f is the frequency of oscillation (10 Hz), and A is the amplitude of oscillation. However, we do not have the amplitude of oscillation given in the problem. Without this information, we cannot calculate the acceleration of the water and, therefore, the maximum horizontal force exerted on the walls of the container.\n\nIf the amplitude of oscillation were provided, we could proceed with the calculation by finding the acceleration and then using Newton's second law (F = m * a) to find the maximum horizontal force exerted on the walls of the container."
