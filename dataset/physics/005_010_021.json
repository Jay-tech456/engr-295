If a light beam is emitted from a source on the spaceship at an angle of 45° relative to the direction of motion, calculate the angle at which the light appears to be traveling from the perspective of the Earth observer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula and the Lorentz transformation. Let's denote the spaceship's velocity as v = 0.8c, and the angle of the light beam relative to the direction of motion as θ = 45°.\n\nFirst, we need to find the components of the light beam's velocity in the spaceship's frame of reference. Since the speed of light is always c, we have:\n\nv_x = c * cos(θ) = c * cos(45°) = c * (1/sqrt(2))\nv_y = c * sin(θ) = c * sin(45°) = c * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nNow, we need to transform these velocities to the Earth observer's frame of reference using the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nu_x = (v_x + v) / (1 + (v_x * v) / c^2) = (c * (1/sqrt(2)) + 0.8c) / (1 + (c * (1/sqrt(2)) * 0.8c) / c^2)\nu_x = (1.8c / sqrt(2)) / (1 + 0.8 / sqrt(2)) = 0.96c\n\nu_y = v_y / (γ * (1 + (v_x * v) / c^2)) = (c * (1/sqrt(2))) / (γ * (1 + (c * (1/sqrt(2)) * 0.8c) / c^2))\nHere, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.8^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 5/3\n\nu_y = (c * (1/sqrt(2))) / ((5/3) * (1 + 0.8 / sqrt(2))) = 0.6c\n\nNow that we have the components of the light beam's velocity in the Earth observer's frame of reference, we can find the angle at which the light appears to be traveling:\n\ntan(θ') = u_y / u_x = (0.6c) / (0.96c) = 0.625\n\nθ' = arctan(0.625) ≈ 32.01°\n\nSo, the angle at which the light appears to be traveling from the perspective of the Earth observer is approximately 32.01°."
