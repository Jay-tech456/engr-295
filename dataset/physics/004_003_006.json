    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime near a massive object like a black hole significantly affects the trajectory of light. This effect is a direct consequence of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\nWhen light passes near a massive object, its path is bent due to the curvature of spacetime. This bending of light is known as gravitational lensing. The amount of bending depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the light and the object. In the case of a black hole, the spacetime curvature is extremely strong, causing light to bend significantly.\n\nGravitational lensing can lead to several observable phenomena:\n\n1. Multiple images: When a distant light source, like a star or a galaxy, is aligned with a massive object and an observer, the light can take multiple paths around the object to reach the observer. This can result in multiple images of the same source appearing in different positions in the sky.\n\n2. Einstein rings: If the alignment between the light source, the massive object, and the observer is perfect, the light can be bent into a complete circle, forming an \"Einstein ring\" around the massive object.\n\n3. Microlensing: When a massive object passes in front of a more distant light source, the light can be temporarily magnified, causing the background source to appear brighter for a short period of time. This is known as microlensing.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: The bending of light near a black hole can also be influenced by the presence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects. These waves can cause additional distortions in the observed light, providing indirect evidence for their existence.\n\nIn summary, the curvature of spacetime near a massive object like a black hole affects the trajectory of light, causing it to bend due to gravitational lensing. This effect leads to several observable phenomena, such as multiple images, Einstein rings, microlensing, and the influence of gravitational waves on the light's path."
