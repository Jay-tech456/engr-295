    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe exact properties of dark matter particles are still unknown, as they have not been directly detected. However, several theoretical candidates have been proposed based on their expected properties and interactions with the known particles of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are one of the leading candidates for dark matter particles. They are expected to have masses in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton and interact with other particles through the weak nuclear force. WIMPs are predicted to be electrically neutral and stable, which means they do not decay into other particles. They would only interact with the known particles of the Standard Model through the weak force and gravity, making them extremely difficult to detect.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are another candidate for dark matter particles. They are predicted to be very light, with masses in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-3 electron volts (eV). Axions are expected to be electrically neutral and interact very weakly with other particles, primarily through the electromagnetic force. They would interact with the known particles of the Standard Model through the electromagnetic force and gravity, making them challenging to detect as well.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known particles of the Standard Model, except through gravity. They are called \"sterile\" because they do not participate in any of the known fundamental forces, except for gravity. Sterile neutrinos could have a wide range of masses, from very light to very heavy, and their properties would depend on their mass.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many dark matter particle candidates that have been proposed. The exact properties and interactions of dark matter particles with the known particles of the Standard Model remain a mystery, and their discovery would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe. Ongoing experiments, such as those using particle colliders, direct detection experiments, and astronomical observations, are actively searching for evidence of dark matter particles and their interactions with the known particles of the Standard Model."
