Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy and the lifetime of the particle before it decays into two particles with rest masses of 1 GeV/c² each. (Note: The decay is an example of a relativistic decay due to the high velocity of the particle.)",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the relativistic kinetic energy. We can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m₀ * c²\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m₀ is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFor the given problem, we have:\n\nv = 0.8c\nm₀ = 4 GeV/c²\n\nLet's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 = 5/3\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (5/3 - 1) * 4 GeV = (2/3) * 4 GeV = 8/3 GeV ≈ 2.67 GeV\n\nNext, let's calculate the lifetime of the particle before it decays. We can use the following formula:\n\nt = t₀ * γ\n\nwhere t is the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, t₀ is the proper lifetime of the particle, and γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe proper lifetime of the particle can be found using the conservation of energy:\n\nE_initial = E_final\n\nwhere E_initial is the initial energy of the particle (rest mass energy + kinetic energy), and E_final is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two decay products.\n\nE_initial = m₀ * c² + K.E. = 4 GeV + 2.67 GeV = 6.67 GeV\nE_final = 2 * 1 GeV = 2 GeV\n\nSince the initial energy is greater than the final energy, the decay is allowed. The proper lifetime of the particle can be found by equating the initial and final energies:\n\nt₀ = (E_initial - E_final) / (m₀ * c²) = (6.67 GeV - 2 GeV) / (4 GeV) = 1.1675\n\nNow, we can calculate the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame:\n\nt = t₀ * γ = 1.1675 * (5/3) ≈ 1.946 s\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 2.67 GeV, and the lifetime of the particle before it decays is approximately 1.946 seconds."
