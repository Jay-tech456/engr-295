    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the gravitational wave produced by a binary system with two black holes, we can use the following formula for the dimensionless strain amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / (c⁴ * D)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\n- M is the total mass of the binary system (in this case, 30 + 20 = 50 solar masses)\n- ω is the angular frequency of the orbit (2 * π * f, where f is the frequency)\n- r is the distance between the black holes (300 km)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n- D is the distance from the binary system to the observer (we will assume 1 Mpc or 3.086 × 10²² m for this calculation)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg\n30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 5.967 × 10³¹ kg\n20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 3.978 × 10³¹ kg\n\nTotal mass (M) = 5.967 × 10³¹ kg + 3.978 × 10³¹ kg = 9.945 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to calculate the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 100 Hz = 200 * π rad/s\n\nNow, we can convert the distance between the black holes to meters:\n\nr = 300 km = 300,000 m\n\nFinally, we can plug all the values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / (c⁴ * D)\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 9.945 × 10³¹ kg * (200 * π rad/s)² * 300,000 m) / ((2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴ * 3.086 × 10²² m)\nh ≈ 1.28 × 10⁻²¹\n\nThe magnitude of the gravitational wave produced by the binary system is approximately 1.28 × 10⁻²¹."
