    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change of the copper block, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT / T\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, m is the mass of the copper block, c is the specific heat of copper, ΔT is the change in temperature, and T is the average temperature during the process.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C\nΔT = 50°C\n\nNext, let's find the average temperature (T) during the process:\n\nT = (T_initial + T_final) / 2\nT = (25°C + 75°C) / 2\nT = 100°C / 2\nT = 50°C\n\nNow, we need to convert the average temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 50°C + 273.15\nT(K) = 323.15 K\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy change (ΔS):\n\nΔS = mcΔT / T\nΔS = (500 g)(0.385 J/g°C)(50°C) / 323.15 K\n\nΔS = 9625 J/°C / 323.15 K\nΔS ≈ 29.79 J/K\n\nThe entropy change of the copper block is approximately 29.79 J/K."
