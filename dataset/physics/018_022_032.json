    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a W boson decaying into a muon and a neutrino with a transverse mass greater than 50 GeV, we need to consider the branching ratio of the W boson decay and the kinematic constraints of the decay products.\n\nThe W boson can decay into a lepton (electron, muon, or tau) and its corresponding neutrino with a total branching ratio of about 33%. The branching ratio for each lepton generation is roughly equal, so the probability of a W boson decaying into a muon and a neutrino is about 11% (1/3 of the total leptonic decay probability).\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the kinematic constraint of having a transverse mass greater than 50 GeV. The transverse mass (MT) is defined as:\n\nMT = sqrt(2 * pT(muon) * pT(neutrino) * (1 - cos(delta_phi)))\n\nwhere pT is the transverse momentum of the muon and neutrino, and delta_phi is the difference in azimuthal angle between them.\n\nTo calculate the probability of having a transverse mass greater than 50 GeV, we would need to integrate the differential cross-section of the W boson production and decay over the phase space of the muon and neutrino, taking into account the detector acceptance and efficiency of the CMS experiment.\n\nThis calculation is quite complex and requires detailed knowledge of the CMS detector and the theoretical predictions for the W boson production and decay. However, the CMS collaboration has published results on the measurement of the W boson production cross-section in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. You can find the relevant information in the following publication:\n\nCMS Collaboration, \"Measurement of the inclusive W and Z production cross sections in pp collisions at âˆšs = 13 TeV\", JHEP 10 (2016) 007, doi:10.1007/JHEP10(2016)007.\n\nIn this publication, you can find the measured cross-sections and the corresponding kinematic distributions of the decay products, which can be used to estimate the probability of a W boson decaying into a muon and a neutrino with a transverse mass greater than 50 GeV."
