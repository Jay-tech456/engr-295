    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is equal to the mass of the sun (M_sun), we can substitute the values:\n\nG = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nM_sun = 1.989 × 10^30 kg (mass of the sun)\nc = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nR_s = 2 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ 2.954 × 10^3 meters\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass equal to that of the sun is approximately 2.954 kilometers."
