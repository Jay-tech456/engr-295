    "message_2": "The nuclear structure of an atom with an atomic number of 12 (magnesium) can be determined by analyzing its atomic number and mass number.\n\n1. Number of protons:\nThe atomic number (Z) represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. Since the atomic number of magnesium is 12, there are 12 protons in its nucleus.\n\n2. Number of neutrons:\nTo calculate the number of neutrons, we need to know the mass number (A) of the magnesium isotope. The most common isotope of magnesium is magnesium-24, with a mass number of 24. The number of neutrons (N) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nN = A - Z\n\nFor magnesium-24:\nN = 24 - 12\nN = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 neutrons in the nucleus of magnesium-24.\n\n3. Mass number:\nThe mass number (A) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For magnesium-24, the mass number is 24.\n\n4. Nuclear radius:\nThe nuclear radius (R) can be estimated using the formula:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nWhere R₀ is a constant equal to approximately 1.2 femtometers (fm) and A is the mass number. For magnesium-24:\n\nR = 1.2 * 24^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.2 * 2.884\nR ≈ 3.46 fm\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of magnesium-24 is approximately 3.46 femtometers.\n\n5. Binding energy per nucleon:\nThe binding energy per nucleon is the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. It is usually expressed in mega-electron volts (MeV) per nucleon. For magnesium-24, the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8.49 MeV.\n\nIn summary, the magnesium-24 nucleus has 12 protons and 12 neutrons, a mass number of 24, a nuclear radius of approximately 3.46 femtometers, and a binding energy per nucleon of approximately 8.49 MeV."
