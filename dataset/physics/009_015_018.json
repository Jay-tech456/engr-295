    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 20 cm is used to form a real image of an object. Due to spherical aberration, the mirror produces five slightly blurred images of the object, with the innermost image being the sharpest. Calculate the radius of curvature of the mirror, given that the aperture diameter is 10 cm and the refractive index of air is 1.00.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the radius of curvature of the concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\nf = R/2\n\nwhere f is the focal length and R is the radius of curvature. We are given the focal length (f) as 20 cm. We can rearrange the equation to solve for R:\n\nR = 2f\n\nNow, we can plug in the given focal length:\n\nR = 2(20 cm)\nR = 40 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the concave mirror is 40 cm."
