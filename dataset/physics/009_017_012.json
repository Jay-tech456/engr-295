    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first minimum of the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\na = 0.15 mm = 0.15 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\nm = 1 (for the first minimum)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.15 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 0.004\n\nNow, to find the angular position θ, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.004)\n\nθ ≈ 0.229 degrees\n\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum of the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.229 degrees."
