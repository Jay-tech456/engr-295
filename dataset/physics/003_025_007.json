    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight current-carrying conductor, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current flowing through the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 3 A and the distance r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (12 × 10⁻⁷ T) / (0.1 m)\nB = 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
