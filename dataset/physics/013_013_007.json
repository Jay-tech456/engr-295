    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a neutron star can have before it collapses into a black hole depends on the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron-rich matter, which describes the relationship between pressure, density, and temperature in the star. The exact EOS for neutron stars is still an area of active research, and different models can lead to slightly different maximum masses.\n\nHowever, based on current understanding and observational data, the maximum mass for a neutron star is typically estimated to be around 2 to 2.5 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). If a neutron star exceeds this mass, it will likely collapse into a black hole due to the overwhelming force of gravity."
