    "message_1": "Here's a precise problem: A gas undergoes a thermodynamic process where its volume decreases from 5 L to 3 L while it absorbs 100 Joules of heat. Calculate the work done by the gas during this process.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during this process, we need to know the pressure of the gas and the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) or constant volume (Cv). However, since this information is not provided, we can only solve this problem using the first law of thermodynamics, which states:\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nwhere ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat absorbed by the gas, and W is the work done by the gas.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to calculate ΔU or W directly, we cannot find the exact value of the work done by the gas during this process. Please provide more information about the gas, such as its pressure or specific heat capacities, to solve this problem."
