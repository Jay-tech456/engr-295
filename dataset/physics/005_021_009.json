    "message_1": "A physics student must calculate the maximum speed at which a particle can travel in a medium with refractive index n, based on relativistic optics principles. The refractive index is 1.5 and the rest mass of the particle is 1 g. What is the maximum speed the particle can travel before it emits radiation?",
    "message_2": "In a medium with a refractive index n, the speed of light is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. When a charged particle travels through a medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium, it emits radiation, known as Cherenkov radiation.\n\nThe refractive index n is given as 1.5, so the speed of light in the medium is:\n\nv_light = c/n = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.5 = 2.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nThe maximum speed the particle can travel before emitting Cherenkov radiation is equal to the speed of light in the medium:\n\nv_max = 2.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nSo, the maximum speed the particle can travel in the medium with a refractive index of 1.5 is 2.0 x 10^8 m/s before it emits radiation."
