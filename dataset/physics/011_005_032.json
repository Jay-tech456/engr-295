    "message_2": "In a ferromagnetic material, the relationship between temperature and magnetization can be described using the Curie-Weiss law. The magnetization (M) of a ferromagnetic material decreases as the temperature (T) increases. This is because, at higher temperatures, the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments of the material to become more randomly oriented, reducing the net magnetization.\n\nThe Curie-Weiss law is given by the equation:\n\nM = C(T - Tc)^(-β)\n\nwhere M is the magnetization, T is the temperature, Tc is the Curie temperature, C is a material-specific constant, and β is the critical exponent (usually close to 0.5 for ferromagnetic materials).\n\nThe Curie temperature (Tc) is the critical temperature at which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic. At the Curie temperature, the thermal energy is high enough to overcome the magnetic interactions between the magnetic moments, and the material loses its spontaneous magnetization.\n\nTo determine the Curie temperature of a ferromagnetic material, one can perform experiments to measure the magnetization of the material at various temperatures. By plotting the magnetization as a function of temperature and fitting the data to the Curie-Weiss law, one can extract the value of Tc from the fit. Alternatively, one can also analyze the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, which is the inverse of the Curie-Weiss law, to determine the Curie temperature."
