    "message_2": "The cosmological constant, denoted by the Greek letter Lambda (Λ), was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1917 as a modification to his General Theory of Relativity. At that time, the prevailing belief was that the universe was static and unchanging, and Einstein added the cosmological constant to counterbalance the attractive force of gravity and maintain a stable, non-expanding universe.\n\nHowever, in the late 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was not static but was actually expanding. This discovery led Einstein to abandon the cosmological constant, calling it his \"biggest blunder.\" For many years, the cosmological constant was largely ignored in cosmology.\n\nThe significance of the cosmological constant re-emerged in the late 20th century when observations of distant supernovae provided evidence that the expansion of the universe was not only happening but was also accelerating. This acceleration could not be explained by the standard model of cosmology, which only accounted for the attractive force of gravity.\n\nTo explain this observed acceleration, scientists reintroduced the cosmological constant as a form of \"dark energy\" – an unknown form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a repulsive force, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. In this context, the cosmological constant represents the energy density of empty space, or vacuum energy.\n\nIn the framework of General Relativity, the cosmological constant appears as an additional term in Einstein's field equations, which describe the relationship between the geometry of spacetime and the distribution of matter and energy. The presence of the cosmological constant implies that empty space has an inherent energy that contributes to the overall dynamics of the universe.\n\nThe current consensus in cosmology is that the universe is composed of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter. The cosmological constant, as a form of dark energy, plays a crucial role in explaining the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe and shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos. However, the exact nature and origin of dark energy remain one of the most significant unsolved problems in modern physics."
