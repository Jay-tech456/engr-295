    "message_2": "The gravitational interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in explaining the observed galaxy rotation curves. Galaxy rotation curves show the relationship between the orbital velocities of stars and gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity (v) of an object in a circular orbit around a massive body is given by:\n\nv^2 = GM(r)/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M(r) is the mass enclosed within the radius r, and r is the distance from the center of the galaxy.\n\nIn the case of a galaxy, if we assume that the mass distribution is dominated by the luminous matter (stars, gas, and dust), we would expect the rotation curve to show a Keplerian decline, i.e., the orbital velocity should decrease as we move away from the center of the galaxy. However, observations of galaxy rotation curves, particularly for spiral galaxies, show a different behavior. The rotation curves tend to be flat or even slightly rising at large radii, indicating that the mass distribution in galaxies is more extended than the distribution of luminous matter.\n\nThis discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on luminous matter alone led to the hypothesis of dark matter. Dark matter is a form of non-luminous, non-baryonic matter that interacts primarily through gravity. The presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy can explain the observed flat rotation curves.\n\nTo understand this, let's consider a galaxy with both luminous matter (M_L) and dark matter (M_DM). The total mass enclosed within a radius r can be written as:\n\nM(r) = M_L(r) + M_DM(r)\n\nThe dark matter is assumed to be distributed in a spherical halo with a density profile that can be described by various models, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile or the isothermal profile. For simplicity, let's consider the isothermal profile, which has a density distribution given by:\n\nρ_DM(r) = ρ_0 / (1 + (r/r_c)^2)\n\nwhere ρ_0 is the central density, and r_c is the core radius.\n\nIntegrating the density profile over the volume enclosed within radius r, we can find the mass of the dark matter within that radius:\n\nM_DM(r) = 4πρ_0 ∫[0, r] r'^2 dr' / (1 + (r'/r_c)^2)\n\nSolving this integral, we get:\n\nM_DM(r) = 4πρ_0 r_c^2 [r - r_c * arctan(r/r_c)]\n\nNow, we can substitute M(r) back into the equation for orbital velocity:\n\nv^2 = G[M_L(r) + M_DM(r)]/r\n\nAs we move to larger radii, the dark matter contribution becomes dominant, and the rotation curve becomes flat or slightly rising, consistent with observations.\n\nEmpirical evidence supporting the dark matter hypothesis comes from various sources, such as gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure formation. These observations, combined with the analysis of galaxy rotation curves, provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and its significant gravitational influence on the dynamics of galaxies."
