    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a specific problem for a physics student to solve in the subtopic of Calculation of magnetic field due to a current-carrying motor:\n\nA motor-powered conveyor belt has a total length of 10 meters and carries a maximum load of 200 kg with a peak velocity of 2 m/s. The motor is powered by a 12-volt battery and has a wire length of 3 meters. Determine the magnetic field strength produced by the current-carrying motor at a distance of 2 meters from the wire.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength produced by the current-carrying motor, we first need to find the current flowing through the wire. We can do this by calculating the power required to move the conveyor belt and then using Ohm's law to find the current.\n\n1. Calculate the power required to move the conveyor belt:\n\nPower (P) = Force (F) × Velocity (v)\n\nThe force required to move the conveyor belt can be calculated using the formula:\n\nForce (F) = Mass (m) × Acceleration (a)\n\nSince the conveyor belt is moving at a constant velocity, we can assume that the acceleration is due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s²). Therefore, the force required to move the conveyor belt is:\n\nF = m × g = 200 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 1962 N\n\nNow, we can calculate the power required to move the conveyor belt:\n\nP = F × v = 1962 N × 2 m/s = 3924 W\n\n2. Calculate the current flowing through the wire:\n\nUsing Ohm's law, Voltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R), we can find the current. However, we need to find the resistance of the wire first. We can use the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nAssuming the wire is made of copper, the resistivity (ρ) is approximately 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm. We need the wire's cross-sectional area to calculate the resistance. Let's assume the wire has a diameter (d) of 2 mm (0.002 m), then the cross-sectional area (A) can be calculated as:\n\nA = π × (d/2)² = π × (0.002/2)² = 3.14 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance of the wire:\n\nR = ρ × L / A = (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm) × 3 m / (3.14 × 10⁻⁶ m²) ≈ 0.016 Ω\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's law to find the current:\n\nI = V / R = 12 V / 0.016 Ω ≈ 750 A\n\n3. Calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nWe can use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field strength (B) at a distance (r) from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ × I) / (2 × π × r)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 750 A) / (2 × π × 2 m) ≈ 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength produced by the current-carrying motor at a distance of 2 meters from the wire is approximately 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ T (Tesla)."
