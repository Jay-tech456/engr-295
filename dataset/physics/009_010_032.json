    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification formula is given by:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWe are given the focal length (f) as 15 cm and the object distance (u) as 10 cm. Note that since the mirror is concave, the focal length is negative. Therefore, f = -15 cm. Now, we can plug in the values and solve for v:\n\n1/(-15) = 1/10 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(-10 + 15)/(-150) = 1/v\n\nNow, simplify and solve for v:\n\n5/(-150) = 1/v\n\nv = -150/5\n\nv = -30 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance (v), we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-30)/10\n\nM = 30/10\n\nM = 3\n\nSo, the magnification of the image is 3.\n\nNow, let's determine if the image is virtual or real. For a concave mirror, if the image distance (v) is negative, the image is virtual and erect. If the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted. In our case, the image distance (v) is -30 cm, which is negative. Therefore, the image formed is virtual and erect."
