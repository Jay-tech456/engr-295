    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification of the object, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -15 cm (concave lens)\nu = -30 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention)\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the lens formula:\n1/(-15) = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n1/v = 1/(-15) - 1/(-30)\n1/v = 2/(-30)\nv = -30/2\nv = -15 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is -15 cm, which means the image is formed 15 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\nm = -(-15)/(-30)\nm = 15/30\nm = 0.5\n\nThe magnification of the object is 0.5, which means the image is half the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright and virtual."
