    "message_2": "The likelihood of primordial black holes (PBHs) being formed due to the collapse of dark matter in the early universe is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among physicists. Some theories suggest that PBHs could have formed from the collapse of high-density regions in the early universe, which could have been dominated by dark matter. However, the exact probability of this occurring is not well-established and depends on various factors, such as the nature of dark matter and the initial conditions of the universe.\n\nAs for the minimum mass required for a primordial black hole to form, it is generally believed to be around the Planck mass, which is approximately 2.2 x 10^-8 kg. This value is derived from fundamental constants in physics, such as the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and the reduced Planck constant. However, it is important to note that PBHs with such a small mass would have already evaporated due to Hawking radiation by now. The minimum mass for a PBH to still exist today is estimated to be around 10^15 kg, which is roughly the mass of a small asteroid.\n\nIn summary, the likelihood of primordial black holes being formed due to the collapse of dark matter in the early universe is still uncertain and depends on various factors. The minimum mass required for a PBH to form is around the Planck mass, but those with such small masses would have already evaporated. The minimum mass for a PBH to still exist today is estimated to be around 10^15 kg."
