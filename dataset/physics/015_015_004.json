    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage difference in amplitude between the two polarizations (elliptical and linear) of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we need to first find the amplitudes of both polarizations.\n\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves (h) is given by the formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * R) / c⁴\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the total mass of the binary black hole system, ω is the angular frequency of the orbit, R is the distance from the source to the observer, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total mass of the binary black hole system (100 solar masses) to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg. Therefore, the total mass of the binary black hole system is:\n\nM = 100 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³² kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from the source to the observer (1 billion light-years) to meters. One light-year is approximately 9.461 × 10¹⁵ m. Therefore, the distance is:\n\nR = 1 × 10⁹ * 9.461 × 10¹⁵ m = 9.461 × 10²⁴ m\n\nNow, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) of the orbit. For simplicity, we will assume that the binary black hole system is in the last stable orbit before merging. In this case, the angular frequency can be approximated as:\n\nω = (c³ / (6 * G * M))^(1/2)\n\nω = (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)³ / (6 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.989 × 10³² kg)^(1/2)\n\nω ≈ 1.77 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves (h):\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.989 × 10³² kg * (1.77 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹)² * 9.461 × 10²⁴ m) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴\n\nh ≈ 1.16 × 10⁻²²\n\nFor an inclination angle of 45 degrees, the amplitudes of the two polarizations are given by:\n\nh_+ = h * (1 + cos²(45°)) / 2\nh_x = h * cos(45°)\n\nCalculating the amplitudes:\n\nh_+ ≈ 1.16 × 10⁻²² * (1 + (0.7071)²) / 2 ≈ 9.67 × 10⁻²³\nh_x ≈ 1.16 × 10⁻²² * 0.7071 ≈ 8.20 × 10⁻²³\n\nNow we can find the percentage difference in amplitude between the two polarizations:\n\nPercentage difference = (|h_+ - h_x| / ((h_+ + h_x) / 2)) * 100%\n\nPercentage difference = (|9.67 × 10⁻²³ - 8.20 × 10⁻²³| / ((9.67 × 10⁻²³ + 8.20 × 10⁻²³) / 2)) * 100%\n\nPercentage difference ≈ 8.19%\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference in amplitude between the two polarizations (elliptical and linear) of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with a total mass of 100 solar masses located 1 billion light-years away, assuming an inclination angle of 45 degrees, is approximately 8.19%."
