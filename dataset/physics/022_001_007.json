    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Several particle candidates have been proposed as dark matter constituents, each with specific physical properties that make them suitable candidates. Here, we will discuss some of the most promising candidates and the evidence supporting their existence.\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are hypothetical particles that interact with other particles through the weak nuclear force and gravity. WIMPs are expected to have a mass in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton. Theoretical models, such as supersymmetry, predict the existence of WIMPs. The suitability of WIMPs as dark matter candidates arises from their predicted relic abundance, which is consistent with the observed dark matter density in the universe. Direct detection experiments, such as XENON1T and LUX, are searching for WIMPs through their scattering off atomic nuclei, but so far, no definitive signal has been detected.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are very light, with a mass in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-3 electron volts (eV). Axions interact very weakly with other particles, making them suitable dark matter candidates. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is searching for axions by looking for their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. While no direct detection of axions has been made yet, their properties make them a compelling dark matter candidate.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through any of the known fundamental forces except gravity. They are heavier than the known active neutrinos and could be produced in the early universe through various mechanisms. Sterile neutrinos could be suitable dark matter candidates due to their weak interactions and predicted relic abundance. Some X-ray observations from galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies have hinted at the possible existence of sterile neutrinos, but more data and analysis are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n4. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs): PBHs are black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could have a wide range of masses, from much smaller than the mass of the Sun to several solar masses. PBHs could serve as dark matter candidates because they do not emit, absorb, or reflect light, and their gravitational effects would be consistent with dark matter observations. However, recent observations from the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors and microlensing surveys have constrained the possible mass range and abundance of PBHs, making them less likely to account for all dark matter.\n\nIn summary, several particle candidates, such as WIMPs, axions, sterile neutrinos, and primordial black holes, have been proposed as dark matter constituents. Each of these candidates has specific physical properties that make them suitable for explaining the observed gravitational effects attributed to dark matter. While there have been some hints and indirect evidence for these candidates, no direct detection or definitive proof has been found yet. Ongoing and future experiments will continue to search for these particles and may eventually provide a clear answer to the nature of dark matter."
