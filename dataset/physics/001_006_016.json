    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron hitting a specific point on the screen, we need to consider the interference pattern created by the electron passing through the double-slit. The probability is related to the intensity of the interference pattern at that specific point.\n\nLet's denote the following variables:\n\n- λ: wavelength of the electron\n- d: spacing between the slits\n- L: distance between the slits and the screen\n- y: vertical distance from the central maximum (bright fringe) to the specific point on the screen\n- θ: angle between the central maximum and the specific point\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle θ using the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nNext, we need to find the path difference between the two slits at the specific point:\n\npath difference = d * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can find the phase difference:\n\nphase difference = (2 * π / λ) * path difference\n\nThe probability of the electron hitting the specific point on the screen is related to the intensity of the interference pattern at that point. The intensity can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ * [cos²(1/2 * phase difference)]\n\nwhere I₀ is the maximum intensity at the central maximum.\n\nFinally, the probability of the electron hitting the specific point on the screen is proportional to the intensity I(θ). To find the exact probability, you would need to normalize the intensity over the entire screen and then find the intensity at the specific point."
