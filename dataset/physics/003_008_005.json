    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced on the axis of a circular current-carrying sheet of radius 'R' and carrying a current 'I' at a point located at a distance 'd' from the center of the sheet using the Biot-Savart law, we need to consider an infinitesimally small current element on the sheet and integrate the magnetic field produced by this element over the entire sheet.\n\nLet's consider a small current element 'dl' on the sheet at a distance 'r' from the center. The magnetic field 'dB' produced by this element at the point on the axis can be given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r') / |r'|³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, r' is the vector from the current element to the point on the axis, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current element and the point on the axis are in the same plane, the angle between dl and r' is 90 degrees. Therefore, the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl × r' = dl * r' * sin(90) = dl * r'\n\nNow, the magnetic field dB can be written as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r') / |r'|³\n\nThe distance from the current element to the point on the axis is:\n\n|r'| = √(r² + d²)\n\nSo, the magnetic field dB becomes:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r') / (r² + d²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire sheet. Since the sheet is circular and symmetric, we can integrate over the radius 'r' and the angle 'θ':\n\nB = ∫∫ dB\n\nLet's first integrate over the angle θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nB_r = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r') / (r² + d²)^(3/2) * dθ\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed, we can write the current element as:\n\ndl = 2π * r * dr\n\nNow, the expression for B_r becomes:\n\nB_r = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * 2π * r * dr * r') / (r² + d²)^(3/2) * dθ\n\nIntegrating over θ from 0 to 2π, we get:\n\nB_r = (μ₀ * I * r * dr * r') / (r² + d²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the radius 'r' from 0 to R:\n\nB = ∫ (μ₀ * I * r * dr * r') / (r² + d²)^(3/2)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet x = r² + d², then 2r dr = dx\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r' / 2) * ∫ (dx) / x^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating this expression, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r' / 2) * [-2 / √x]\n\nNow, substitute back the value of x:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r') * [-1 / √(r² + d²)]\n\nFinally, evaluate the integral from r = 0 to r = R:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r') * [1 / √(d²) - 1 / √(R² + d²)]\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r') * [(√(R² + d²) - d) / (d * √(R² + d²))]\n\nSince r' = d, the magnetic field B on the axis of the circular current-carrying sheet is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * d) * [(√(R² + d²) - d) / (d * √(R² + d²))]"
