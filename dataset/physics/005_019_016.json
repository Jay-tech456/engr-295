    "message_1": "A beam of light of frequency 5×10^14 Hz is emitted from a source and travels a distance of 10 meters before encountering a barrier with two slits that are separated by 0.1 mm. If the interference pattern on a screen placed 1 meter away from the barrier shows a dark fringe at an angle of 10 degrees from the central maximum, calculate the width of the central maximum.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the double-slit interference formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the fringe from the central maximum, m is the order of the fringe (m = 0 for the central maximum, m = 1 for the first dark fringe, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength of the light. We can use the formula:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nλ = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (5 × 10^14 Hz) = 6 × 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can use the double-slit interference formula to find the angle of the first dark fringe (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 6 × 10^-7 m) / (0.1 × 10^-3 m)\n\nsin(θ) = 6 × 10^-4\n\nθ = arcsin(6 × 10^-4) ≈ 0.0349 radians ≈ 2 degrees\n\nSince the problem states that the dark fringe is at an angle of 10 degrees from the central maximum, the width of the central maximum is the difference between the angles of the first dark fringe and the central maximum:\n\nWidth of central maximum = 10 degrees - 2 degrees = 8 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the width of the central maximum on the screen:\n\nWidth = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere L is the distance from the barrier to the screen (1 meter) and θ is the angle of the central maximum in radians.\n\nWidth = 1 m * tan(8 degrees) ≈ 1 m * 0.1392 = 0.1392 m\n\nSo, the width of the central maximum on the screen is approximately 0.1392 meters or 13.92 cm."
