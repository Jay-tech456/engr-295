    "message_1": "What is the estimated rate of gravitational wave detections that can be observed by the upcoming LISA observatory, and how does it compare to the rate of detections observed by previous observatories such as LIGO and Virgo?",
    "message_2": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a future space-based gravitational wave observatory, planned for launch in the 2030s. It is designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves in the range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz, which are not accessible to ground-based observatories like LIGO and Virgo. LISA will be sensitive to a variety of astrophysical sources, including merging massive black holes, compact binary systems in our galaxy, and possibly even signals from the early universe.\n\nThe estimated rate of gravitational wave detections by LISA depends on the type of sources being considered. For massive black hole mergers, LISA is expected to detect around 10 to 100 events per year. For extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a smaller compact object spirals into a massive black hole, the detection rate is estimated to be around 25 to 100 events per year. For compact binary systems in our galaxy, LISA could detect thousands of systems, with many of them being continuously observable throughout the mission.\n\nIn comparison, LIGO and Virgo have been detecting gravitational waves primarily from binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers. The current detection rate for LIGO and Virgo is around 1 event per week, which translates to approximately 50 to 100 events per year. However, this rate is expected to increase as the detectors' sensitivities improve in the coming years.\n\nIn summary, LISA is expected to detect a similar or higher rate of gravitational wave events compared to LIGO and Virgo, but from different types of sources and frequency ranges. This will provide complementary information and help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of the gravitational wave universe."
