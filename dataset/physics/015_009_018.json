    "message_2": "To estimate the average frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by a binary neutron star system, we can use the chirp mass formula and the inspiral phase of the waveform. The chirp mass (M_c) is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the individual masses of the neutron stars. Since the total mass is 3.5 solar masses, we can assume m1 = m2 = 1.75 solar masses for simplicity.\n\nM_c = (1.75 * 1.75)^(3/5) / (1.75 + 1.75)^(1/5) ≈ 1.46 solar masses\n\nNow, we can use the chirp mass to estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase. The frequency (f) is given by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5 / 96)^(3/8) * (π * M_c)^(-5/8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the chirp mass from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nM_c ≈ 1.46 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 2.9 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf ≈ (3 x 10^8)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5 / 96)^(3/8) * (π * 2.9 x 10^30)^(-5/8)\nf ≈ 157 Hz\n\nSo, the average frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary neutron star system is approximately 157 Hz. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and the actual frequency may vary depending on the specific parameters of the system and the stage of the inspiral."
