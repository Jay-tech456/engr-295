    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total energy and momentum of the system before and after the collision. We'll use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy: E = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n2. Relativistic momentum: p = mv / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy and momentum of the proton and antiproton before the collision.\n\nThe mass of a proton (and antiproton) is approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nProton:\nv1 = 0.5c = 0.5 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 1.5 x 10^8 m/s\n\nEnergy: E1 = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (1.5 x 10^8 m/s)^2/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nE1 ≈ 1.503 x 10^-10 J\n\nMomentum: p1 = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(1.5 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (1.5 x 10^8 m/s)^2/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\np1 ≈ 1.11 x 10^-19 kg m/s\n\nAntiproton:\nv2 = 0.6c = 0.6 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 1.8 x 10^8 m/s\n\nEnergy: E2 = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (1.8 x 10^8 m/s)^2/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nE2 ≈ 2.039 x 10^-10 J\n\nMomentum: p2 = -(1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(1.8 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (1.8 x 10^8 m/s)^2/(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\np2 ≈ -1.47 x 10^-19 kg m/s (negative sign indicates opposite direction)\n\nNow, let's find the total energy and momentum before the collision:\n\nTotal energy before collision: E_total_before = E1 + E2 ≈ 1.503 x 10^-10 J + 2.039 x 10^-10 J ≈ 3.542 x 10^-10 J\n\nTotal momentum before collision: p_total_before = p1 + p2 ≈ 1.11 x 10^-19 kg m/s - 1.47 x 10^-19 kg m/s ≈ -0.36 x 10^-19 kg m/s\n\nSince the collision is perfectly elastic, the total energy and momentum will be conserved after the collision. Therefore, the total energy and momentum after the collision will be the same as before the collision:\n\nTotal energy after collision: E_total_after ≈ 3.542 x 10^-10 J\nTotal momentum after collision: p_total_after ≈ -0.36 x 10^-19 kg m/s"
