    "message_2": "To determine the kinetic energy of the spaceship, we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is given by:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy using the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK.E. = (2.294 - 1)(1000 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 1.294 × 1000 kg × (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 1.164 × 10^20 Joules\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.164 × 10^20 Joules."
