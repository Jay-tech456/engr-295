    "message_2": "The renormalization procedure in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a mathematical technique used to deal with the infinities that arise in calculations involving the interactions of charged particles, such as electrons and photons. These infinities are a consequence of the self-energy of charged particles, which is the energy associated with the interaction of a particle with its own electromagnetic field.\n\nThe problem of infinite self-energy arises when we try to calculate the physical properties of charged particles, such as their mass and charge, using the principles of QED. The calculations involve summing over all possible interactions between the particles and their electromagnetic fields, which leads to divergent integrals and infinite results. This is clearly unphysical, as we know that particles have finite mass and charge.\n\nThe renormalization procedure is a way to make sense of these infinite results by introducing a regularization scheme and redefining the physical parameters of the theory. The basic idea is to separate the infinite contributions from the finite ones and absorb the infinities into the redefinition of the parameters, such as the bare mass and charge of the particles.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the renormalization procedure in QED:\n\n1. Regularization: Introduce a regularization scheme to make the divergent integrals finite. This can be done using various methods, such as introducing a momentum cutoff or using dimensional regularization.\n\n2. Renormalization of the mass and charge: Split the bare mass and charge of the particles into a finite part and an infinite part. The finite part corresponds to the observed mass and charge, while the infinite part is absorbed into the redefinition of the parameters.\n\n3. Renormalization of the fields: Redefine the fields in terms of renormalized fields, which have finite values and are related to the bare fields by a renormalization constant.\n\n4. Renormalization of the coupling constant: Redefine the coupling constant, which describes the strength of the interaction between the particles and the electromagnetic field, in terms of a renormalized coupling constant.\n\n5. Renormalized perturbation theory: Perform calculations using the renormalized parameters and fields, which yield finite results for physical observables.\n\nBy applying the renormalization procedure, we can obtain finite and physically meaningful results for the properties of charged particles in QED, despite the presence of infinite self-energy contributions. This technique has been crucial in the development of modern particle physics and has been successfully applied to other quantum field theories as well."
