    "message_2": "To find the specific angle of incidence on a polarizing filter for which the intensity of the transmitted light is half the intensity of the incident light, we can use Malus's Law. Malus's Law states that the intensity of transmitted light (I_t) through a polarizing filter is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the plane of polarization of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_i is the intensity of the incident light.\n\nWe are given that the intensity of the transmitted light is half the intensity of the incident light:\n\nI_t = 0.5 * I_i\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.5 * I_i = I_i * cos^2(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I_i:\n\n0.5 = cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides:\n\nθ = arccos(1/sqrt(2))\n\nθ ≈ 45°\n\nSo, the specific angle of incidence on a polarizing filter for which the intensity of the transmitted light is half the intensity of the incident light is approximately 45 degrees."
