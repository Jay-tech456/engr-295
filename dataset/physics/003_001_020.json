    "message_1": "A long straight wire with a radius of 1mm and carrying a current of 2A is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.5 T. What is the magnitude of magnetic force acting on a 10cm length of the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field, we can use the formula:\n\nF = B * I * L * sinθ\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, B is the magnetic field, I is the current, L is the length of the wire, and θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the angle θ is 90 degrees, and sin(90) = 1.\n\nGiven values:\nB = 0.5 T (Tesla)\nI = 2 A (Amperes)\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m (meters, converted from centimeters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nF = (0.5 T) * (2 A) * (0.1 m) * sin(90)\nF = 1 T*A*m\n\nSince 1 T*A*m = 1 N (Newton), the magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the 10 cm length of the wire is:\n\nF = 1 N"
