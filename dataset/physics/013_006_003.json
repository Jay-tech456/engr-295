    "message_2": "A typical supernova explosion releases an enormous amount of energy, on the order of 10^44 joules (1 foe, where \"foe\" stands for \"ten to the power of fifty-one ergs\"). This energy is released in various forms, including:\n\n1. Kinetic energy of the ejected material: A significant portion of the energy, about 1% (10^42 joules), is converted into the kinetic energy of the ejected material. This material, which consists of the outer layers of the star, is expelled at speeds of up to 10,000 km/s. As this material expands and interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium, it forms a supernova remnant, which can be observed as a glowing nebula.\n\n2. Neutrinos: The majority of the energy released in a supernova explosion, about 99% (10^46 joules), is carried away by neutrinos. Neutrinos are extremely light, neutral particles that interact very weakly with matter. They are produced in vast quantities during the core collapse of a massive star, and they escape the core almost immediately, carrying away energy in the process. Although most of the neutrinos pass through the surrounding material without interacting, a small fraction of them do interact with the outer layers of the star, providing an additional source of energy that contributes to the explosion.\n\n3. Electromagnetic radiation: A small fraction of the energy released in a supernova explosion is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, X-rays, and gamma rays. This radiation is produced by various processes, such as the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes created during the explosion (e.g., nickel-56 decaying to cobalt-56 and then to iron-56) and the thermal radiation from the hot, expanding ejecta. The visible light emitted by a supernova can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, making it visible from great distances.\n\n4. Gravitational energy: The core collapse that triggers a supernova explosion also leads to the formation of a compact object, either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the progenitor star. The gravitational potential energy released during the core collapse contributes to the overall energy budget of the supernova.\n\nIn summary, a typical supernova explosion releases an immense amount of energy, primarily in the form of neutrinos, but also as kinetic energy of the ejected material, electromagnetic radiation, and gravitational energy. This energy is conveyed to the surrounding environment through the expansion of the supernova remnant, the emission of electromagnetic radiation, and the interactions of neutrinos with surrounding matter."
