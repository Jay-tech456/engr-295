    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the laminar sub-layer and estimate the drag force per unit width of the car due to the boundary layer, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Convert the car's speed to meters per second (m/s):\n60 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 16.67 m/s\n\n2. Assume the kinematic viscosity of air (ν) to be approximately 1.5 x 10^-5 m^2/s.\n\n3. Calculate the Reynolds number (Re) at the edge of the boundary layer:\nRe = (U * δ) / ν\nwhere U is the car's speed, and δ is the boundary layer thickness.\n\nRe = (16.67 m/s * 0.002 m) / (1.5 x 10^-5 m^2/s) = 2222.67\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 5000, we can assume the boundary layer is laminar.\n\n4. Calculate the thickness of the laminar sub-layer (δ_laminar) using the formula:\nδ_laminar = 5 * ν / U\n\nδ_laminar = 5 * (1.5 x 10^-5 m^2/s) / (16.67 m/s) = 4.5 x 10^-6 m = 4.5 μm\n\n5. Estimate the drag force per unit width of the car due to the boundary layer using the formula for the drag force on a flat plate in a laminar flow:\nF_d = (1/2) * ρ * U^2 * C_f * L\nwhere ρ is the air density (approximately 1.225 kg/m^3), C_f is the skin friction coefficient, and L is the length of the car in contact with the boundary layer.\n\nFor a laminar boundary layer, the skin friction coefficient can be calculated as:\nC_f = 1.328 / sqrt(Re)\n\nC_f = 1.328 / sqrt(2222.67) = 0.0282\n\nAssuming the length of the car in contact with the boundary layer is 4 meters, we can calculate the drag force per unit width:\n\nF_d = (1/2) * 1.225 kg/m^3 * (16.67 m/s)^2 * 0.0282 * 4 m = 246.5 N\n\nSo, the thickness of the laminar sub-layer is approximately 4.5 μm, and the estimated drag force per unit width of the car due to the boundary layer is 246.5 N."
