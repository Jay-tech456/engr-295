    "message_2": "To calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a non-rotating black hole, we use the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, 10 solar masses is:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nNow, let's consider a rotating black hole with the same mass. The event horizon radius of a rotating black hole is given by the Kerr metric, which depends on the black hole's angular momentum. The formula for the event horizon radius (R+) of a maximally rotating black hole is:\n\nR+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\n\nwhere a is the specific angular momentum, which is equal to GM/c for a maximally rotating black hole.\n\nFor our black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses, we have:\n\na = GM/c = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\na ≈ 4.43 x 10^4 m\n\nNow we can calculate the event horizon radius:\n\nR+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\nR+ ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m + sqrt((2.95 x 10^4 m)^2 - (4.43 x 10^4 m)^2)\nR+ ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m + sqrt(8.70 x 10^8 m^2 - 1.96 x 10^9 m^2)\nR+ ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m + sqrt(-9.89 x 10^8 m^2)\nR+ ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m + 0\nR+ ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe event horizon radius of a maximally rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is also approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole and the event horizon radius of a maximally rotating black hole with the same mass of 10 solar masses are approximately equal, both being around 29.5 kilometers."
