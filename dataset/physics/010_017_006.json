    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank is filled with water and is mounted on a frame. The frame vibrates at a natural frequency of 10 Hz. The diameter of the tank is 2 meters and the height is 3 meters. Determine the natural frequency of the water in the tank and the amplitude of the water surface vibrations.",
    "message_2": "To determine the natural frequency of the water in the tank, we can use the following formula for the natural frequency of a liquid in a cylindrical container:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(g / R)\n\nwhere f is the natural frequency, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and R is the radius of the tank.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the tank. Since the diameter is 2 meters, the radius R is half of that:\n\nR = 2 m / 2 = 1 m\n\nNow we can calculate the natural frequency of the water:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(9.81 m/s² / 1 m)\nf ≈ 0.498 Hz\n\nThe natural frequency of the water in the tank is approximately 0.498 Hz.\n\nNext, we need to determine the amplitude of the water surface vibrations. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nA = (X * f²) / (f² - f₀²)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, X is the displacement of the frame (which we will assume to be 1 m for simplicity), f is the natural frequency of the water, and f₀ is the natural frequency of the frame.\n\nWe already found the natural frequency of the water (f ≈ 0.498 Hz), and we are given that the natural frequency of the frame is 10 Hz. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = (1 m * (0.498 Hz)²) / ((0.498 Hz)² - (10 Hz)²)\nA ≈ 0.0025 m\n\nThe amplitude of the water surface vibrations is approximately 0.0025 meters, or 2.5 millimeters."
