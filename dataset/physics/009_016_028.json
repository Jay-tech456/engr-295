    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 500 nm is diffracted through a single slit of width 0.2 mm. At what angle from the central maximum will the first diffraction minimum be observed on a screen placed 1 meter away from the slit?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of the first diffraction minimum, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle from the central maximum, m is the order of the diffraction minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\nSlit width (a) = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 2.5 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(2.5 * 10^(-6))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 1.43 * 10^(-3) radians\n\nTo convert this angle to degrees, we can use the conversion factor (180°/π):\n\nθ ≈ (1.43 * 10^(-3)) * (180/π) ≈ 0.082°\n\nSo, the first diffraction minimum will be observed at an angle of approximately 0.082° from the central maximum."
