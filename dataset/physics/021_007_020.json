    "message_2": "The effect of a black hole's gravitational pull on a nearby celestial body, such as a star, depends on the distance between the two objects and the masses involved. When a star is in the vicinity of a black hole, it experiences a strong gravitational force that can significantly influence its orbit and eventual fate.\n\n1. Orbit: If the star is at a safe distance from the black hole, it may enter into a stable orbit around the black hole, similar to how planets orbit around stars. This stable orbit is determined by a balance between the gravitational force pulling the star towards the black hole and the star's orbital velocity, which prevents it from falling inwards. The closer the star is to the black hole, the faster it needs to move to maintain a stable orbit.\n\n2. Tidal forces: As the star gets closer to the black hole, it experiences tidal forces due to the difference in gravitational pull on the near and far sides of the star. This can cause the star to become elongated and distorted, potentially leading to tidal disruption. If the tidal forces are strong enough, they can tear the star apart, with some of the material being ejected into space and some being accreted onto the black hole.\n\n3. Accretion and emission of radiation: As the star's material falls towards the black hole, it forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The material in the accretion disk becomes heated due to friction and gravitational energy, emitting radiation in the form of light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. This process can cause the black hole to grow in mass, while the star loses mass over time.\n\n4. Eventual fate: The eventual fate of the star depends on its initial mass, distance from the black hole, and the rate at which it loses mass due to tidal forces and accretion. If the star remains in a stable orbit and loses mass slowly, it may continue to orbit the black hole for a long time. However, if the star loses a significant amount of mass or gets too close to the black hole, it may be completely disrupted and consumed by the black hole.\n\nIn summary, a black hole's gravitational pull can have significant effects on a nearby star, influencing its orbit, causing tidal disruption, and potentially leading to the star's eventual consumption by the black hole. The specific outcome depends on the initial conditions and the properties of both the black hole and the star."
