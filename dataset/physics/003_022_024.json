    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by the motor at a distance of 0.1 meters from its center, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a small segment of a current-carrying wire (with current I) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current = 2 A\ndl = length of the small segment of the wire\nθ = angle between dl and the position vector r (in this case, it's 90 degrees since the wire is orthogonal to the magnetic field)\nr = distance from the wire segment to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field = 0.1 m\n\nSince the motor is 0.5 meters long, we can divide it into small segments and integrate the magnetic field produced by each segment. However, to simplify the calculation, we can approximate the magnetic field produced by the motor by considering the motor as a straight wire with a length of 0.5 meters.\n\nIn this case, the angle θ is 90 degrees, so sinθ = 1. We can now calculate the magnetic field produced by the motor at a distance of 0.1 meters from its center:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nIntegrating over the length of the wire (0.5 meters), we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * L) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire (0.5 meters).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.5 m) / (4 * π * (0.1 m)²)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.5) / (4 * π * 0.01)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 1) / (4 * π * 0.01)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nB = (10^(-7) * 1) / (0.01)\nB = 10^(-7) / 0.01\nB = 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced by the motor at a distance of 0.1 meters from its center is approximately 10^(-5) Tesla."
