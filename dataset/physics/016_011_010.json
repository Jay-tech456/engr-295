    "message_2": "Temperature plays a crucial role in the formation of Cooper pairs and the phenomenon of superconductivity. Cooper pairs are formed when two electrons with opposite spins and momenta are attracted to each other through an effective attractive interaction mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons) in the material. This attractive interaction overcomes the natural repulsion between electrons due to their negative charge.\n\nAt high temperatures, the thermal energy of the electrons is too high, and the attractive interaction between electrons is not strong enough to form stable Cooper pairs. The electrons move independently, and the material exhibits normal electrical resistance.\n\nAs the temperature is lowered, the thermal energy of the electrons decreases, and the attractive interaction between electrons becomes more significant. Below a critical temperature (Tc), the attractive interaction is strong enough to bind electrons into Cooper pairs. These pairs of electrons can move through the lattice without scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations, resulting in zero electrical resistance, a characteristic of superconductivity.\n\nThe critical temperature (Tc) is a material-dependent property and varies for different superconducting materials. For conventional superconductors, Tc is typically below 30 K (-243.15 °C). However, for high-temperature superconductors, Tc can be as high as 138 K (-135.15 °C).\n\nIn summary, temperature affects the formation of Cooper pairs in superconductivity by determining the balance between the attractive interaction between electrons and their thermal energy. At low temperatures, the attractive interaction dominates, leading to the formation of Cooper pairs and the onset of superconductivity."
