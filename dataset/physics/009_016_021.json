    "message_2": "To find the angle of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m and the slit width a = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m, we can find the angle for the first minimum (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 2.5 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(2.5 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 2.5 * 10^(-6) radians (since the angle is very small, sin(θ) ≈ θ in radians)\n\nTo convert the angle from radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor 180°/π:\n\nθ ≈ (2.5 * 10^(-6) * 180) / π\n\nθ ≈ 1.43 * 10^(-4) degrees\n\nSo, the angle of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 1.43 * 10^(-4) degrees."
