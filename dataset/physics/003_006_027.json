    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the radius R = 10 cm = 0.1 m and the current I = 2 A, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.2\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the circular coil is approximately 1.2566 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (going counterclockwise when viewed from above), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing upwards (out of the plane) at the center of the coil."
