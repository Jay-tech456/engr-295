    "message_1": "A generator coil consists of a circular-shaped loop with a radius of 0.1 meters and 50 turns. The current flowing through the coil is 5 amps. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 50) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 5 * 50) / 0.2\n\nB = (10π × 10^(-7) * 50) / 0.2\n\nB = (500π × 10^(-7)) / 0.2\n\nB = 2500π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 7.85 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 7.85 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
