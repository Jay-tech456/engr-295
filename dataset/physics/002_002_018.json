If the rate of heat transfer from the rod to its surroundings is found to be 200 J/s, what is the thermal conductivity of the material of the rod?\"",
    "message_2": "We can use the formula for the rate of heat transfer through a rod, which is given by:\n\nQ/t = k * A * (T1 - T2) / L\n\nwhere Q/t is the rate of heat transfer (200 J/s), k is the thermal conductivity of the material, A is the cross-sectional area (5 cm²), T1 and T2 are the temperatures at the two ends of the rod (150°C and 50°C), and L is the length of the rod (50 cm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length and area to meters and square meters, respectively:\n\nL = 50 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.5 m\nA = 5 cm² * (1 m² / 10000 cm²) = 0.0005 m²\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula and solve for k:\n\n200 J/s = k * 0.0005 m² * (150°C - 50°C) / 0.5 m\n\n200 J/s = k * 0.0005 m² * 100°C / 0.5 m\n\n200 J/s = k * 0.0005 m² * 100°C / 0.5 m\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n200 J/s = k * 0.0005 * 100 / 0.5\n\n200 J/s = k * 0.1\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = (200 J/s) / 0.1\n\nk = 2000 J/(m·s·°C)\n\nThe thermal conductivity of the material of the rod is 2000 J/(m·s·°C)."
