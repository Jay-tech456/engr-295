Assuming time dilation due to special relativity, what time will the clock on Earth read when the spaceship's clock reads 11:00 AM? Use Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula derived from the Lorentz transformation. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time interval measured in the moving frame (spaceship's frame), Δt is the time interval measured in the stationary frame (Earth's frame), v is the relative velocity between the two frames, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the spaceship is traveling at a velocity of 0.8c relative to Earth. The clock onboard the spaceship reads 10:00 AM when the spaceship passes Earth, and we want to find out what time the clock on Earth will read when the spaceship's clock reads 11:00 AM.\n\nThe time interval in the spaceship's frame is Δt' = 1 hour (from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM). We can now plug in the values into the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = Δt' * √(1 - v^2/c^2)\nΔt = 1 hour * √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nΔt = 1 hour * √(1 - 0.64)\nΔt = 1 hour * √(0.36)\nΔt = 1 hour * 0.6\n\nΔt = 1.6667 hours\n\nSo, the time interval measured on Earth is 1.6667 hours. Adding this to the initial time of 10:00 AM:\n\n10:00 AM + 1.6667 hours = 11:40 AM (approximately)\n\nTherefore, when the spaceship's clock reads 11:00 AM, the clock on Earth will read approximately 11:40 AM."
