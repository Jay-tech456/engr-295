    "message_2": "The minimum number of qubits required for a quantum annealer to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for n cities can be determined by formulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In this formulation, we need to define n^2 binary variables, where each variable x_ij represents whether the salesman visits city i at step j or not. Therefore, the minimum number of qubits required is n^2.\n\nThe corresponding annealing time required for this computation depends on various factors, such as the quantum annealer's architecture, the specific algorithm used, and the problem's complexity. In general, the annealing time for quantum annealers increases with the problem size and complexity. However, it is difficult to provide an exact value for the annealing time without knowing the specific details of the quantum annealer and the algorithm used.\n\nIt is also important to note that the quantum annealing approach does not guarantee an optimal solution for the TSP, as it is a heuristic method. The performance of quantum annealers in solving TSP instances is still an active area of research, and improvements in algorithms and hardware may lead to better solutions in the future."
