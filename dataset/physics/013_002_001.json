    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a star can have before it undergoes a supernova explosion is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit is approximately 3 solar masses (Mâ˜‰) for neutron stars, which are the remnants of supernova explosions. However, the progenitor star (the star before the supernova) can have a much larger mass, typically between 8 to 20 solar masses or even higher, depending on various factors such as metallicity and rotation.\n\nThere are two main types of supernova explosions: Type Ia and Type II. The nucleosynthesis processes that occur during these explosions are as follows:\n\n1. Type Ia Supernova: This type of supernova occurs in a binary star system, where a white dwarf accretes mass from its companion star. When the white dwarf's mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 solar masses), it becomes unstable and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion. The main nucleosynthesis process during a Type Ia supernova is the explosive burning of carbon and oxygen, which produces a large amount of iron-group elements (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt) and intermediate-mass elements (such as silicon, sulfur, and calcium).\n\n2. Type II Supernova: This type of supernova occurs when a massive star (with a mass greater than 8 solar masses) exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity. The core-collapse triggers a powerful shock wave that propagates through the outer layers of the star, causing the explosion. The main nucleosynthesis processes during a Type II supernova are:\n\n   a. Silicon burning: This process occurs in the final stages of the massive star's life, producing iron-group elements. The silicon burning is quenched by the core-collapse, leaving an iron-nickel core.\n\n   b. Explosive nucleosynthesis: The shock wave generated by the core-collapse heats the outer layers of the star, causing explosive burning of lighter elements. This process produces intermediate-mass elements and some heavier elements up to the iron-group.\n\n   c. Neutron capture processes: During the explosion, a large number of neutrons are released, which can be captured by seed nuclei to produce heavier elements. There are two main neutron capture processes: the rapid (r-process) and the slow (s-process). The r-process occurs in the high-neutron-density environment of the supernova and is responsible for the production of about half of the elements heavier than iron, including many rare and radioactive isotopes. The s-process occurs in the outer layers of the star before the explosion and contributes to the production of stable isotopes of elements heavier than iron.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of a star before it undergoes a supernova explosion is typically between 8 to 20 solar masses or even higher. The main nucleosynthesis processes during the explosion include explosive burning of carbon and oxygen (Type Ia), silicon burning, explosive nucleosynthesis, and neutron capture processes (Type II)."
