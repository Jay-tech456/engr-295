    "message_2": "First, let's find the velocity of the proton with respect to the accelerator. We know that the kinetic energy of the proton is given by:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light. We can rearrange this equation to solve for γ:\n\nγ = 1 + K/(mc^2)\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately m = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and the speed of light is c = 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nγ = 1 + (10 x 10^9 eV) / ((1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nγ ≈ 10.6\n\nNow we can find the velocity of the proton with respect to the accelerator using the Lorentz factor:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2)\nv ≈ 0.995c\n\nNow, let's find the velocity of the proton according to the observer moving at a relative velocity of 0.8c with respect to the accelerator. We can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv' = (v - u) / (1 - vu/c^2)\n\nwhere v' is the velocity of the proton according to the observer, v is the velocity of the proton with respect to the accelerator, and u is the relative velocity of the observer with respect to the accelerator.\n\nv' = (0.995c - 0.8c) / (1 - (0.995c)(0.8c)/c^2)\nv' ≈ 0.609c\n\nSo, the velocity of the proton according to the observer moving at a relative velocity of 0.8c with respect to the accelerator is approximately 0.609c."
