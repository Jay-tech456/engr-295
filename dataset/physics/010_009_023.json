    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of water in the tank and the flow rate of the drain. Then, we can calculate the time it takes to drain the tank.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of water in the tank:\nThe water forms a spherical cap in the tank. The volume of a spherical cap can be calculated using the formula:\nV = (1/6) * π * h * (3a^2 + h^2)\n\nwhere V is the volume, h is the height of the cap (3 meters, since the tank has a radius of 5 meters and is filled up to 8 meters), and a is the radius of the base of the cap.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the base (a) using the Pythagorean theorem:\na^2 + h^2 = R^2\na^2 = R^2 - h^2\na^2 = 5^2 - 3^2\na^2 = 25 - 9\na^2 = 16\na = 4 meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of water in the tank:\nV = (1/6) * π * 3 * (3 * 4^2 + 3^2)\nV = (1/6) * π * 3 * (48 + 9)\nV = (1/2) * π * 57\nV ≈ 89.65 m^3\n\n2. Calculate the flow rate of the drain:\nWe can use the Torricelli's law to find the velocity of the water flowing out of the drain:\nv = √(2 * g * h)\n\nwhere v is the velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the water above the drain (8 meters).\n\nv = √(2 * 9.81 * 8)\nv ≈ 12.65 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the flow rate (Q) using the formula:\nQ = A * v\n\nwhere A is the area of the drain. The drain has a diameter of 20 cm, which is equal to 0.2 meters. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\nA = π * r^2\n\nThe radius of the drain is 0.1 meters, so:\nA = π * (0.1)^2\nA ≈ 0.0314 m^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the flow rate:\nQ = 0.0314 * 12.65\nQ ≈ 0.397 m^3/s\n\n3. Calculate the time it takes to drain the tank:\nFinally, we can find the time (t) it takes to drain the tank using the formula:\nt = V / Q\n\nt = 89.65 / 0.397\nt ≈ 225.7 seconds\n\nIt will take approximately 225.7 seconds (or about 3 minutes and 46 seconds) to completely drain the tank."
