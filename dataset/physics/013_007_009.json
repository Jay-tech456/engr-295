    "message_2": "The distribution of mass within the Milky Way's disk can be broadly categorized into three main components: the stellar disk, the gas disk, and the dark matter halo. The stellar disk contains the majority of the stars in the galaxy, while the gas disk is composed of interstellar gas and dust. The dark matter halo is a hypothetical component that is believed to surround the galaxy and account for the unexplained mass needed to explain the observed rotation curve.\n\nThe motion of stars within the disk is governed by the gravitational forces acting upon them, which are primarily determined by the distribution of mass in the galaxy. According to Newton's law of gravitation, the force acting on a star is proportional to the mass of the galaxy enclosed within the star's orbit and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the star and the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe observed rotation curve of the Milky Way, which plots the orbital velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the galactic center, shows that the velocities remain roughly constant or even slightly increase with increasing distance from the center. This is contrary to what would be expected if the mass distribution followed the visible matter alone (stars and gas), in which case the velocities should decrease with distance due to the decreasing mass enclosed within the orbits.\n\nTo explain this discrepancy, astronomers have proposed the existence of dark matter, a form of non-luminous matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is thus invisible to telescopes. The presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy would provide the additional mass needed to account for the observed rotation curve. The exact nature and composition of dark matter are still unknown, but its existence is supported by various lines of evidence, including the dynamics of galaxy clusters and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of mass within the Milky Way's disk, including the stellar disk, gas disk, and dark matter halo, affects the motion of stars within the disk. The observed rotation curve of the Milky Way can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides the additional mass needed to account for the velocities of stars at large distances from the galactic center."
