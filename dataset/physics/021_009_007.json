    "message_2": "The current theory on the fate of information that falls into a black hole is described by the Black Hole Information Paradox, which arises from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. This paradox was first introduced by Stephen Hawking in the 1970s.\n\nAccording to classical general relativity, once information falls into a black hole, it is lost forever as nothing can escape from the black hole's event horizon. However, Hawking discovered that black holes can emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation causes the black hole to lose mass and eventually evaporate completely.\n\nThe problem arises because Hawking radiation is thermal and does not carry any information about the matter that fell into the black hole. This contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics, which state that information must be conserved in any physical process. This conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics is the essence of the Black Hole Information Paradox.\n\nSeveral proposals have been made to resolve this paradox, including:\n\n1. Black hole complementarity: This idea, proposed by Leonard Susskind, suggests that the information is both inside and outside the black hole, but in a complementary way. Observers outside the black hole see the information encoded in the Hawking radiation, while observers falling into the black hole see the information inside. However, no observer can access both sets of information simultaneously.\n\n2. Holographic principle: This principle states that the information of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary, like a hologram. In the context of black holes, the information about the matter that fell in could be stored on the event horizon, and then released as the black hole evaporates.\n\n3. Firewall hypothesis: This proposal suggests that a highly energetic \"firewall\" exists at the event horizon, which destroys any information that falls into the black hole. However, this idea is controversial as it contradicts the equivalence principle of general relativity.\n\n4. Loop quantum gravity: This approach to quantum gravity suggests that the structure of spacetime at the Planck scale could resolve the information paradox. In this framework, the black hole singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the information could be released as the black hole evaporates.\n\nDespite these proposals, a complete and universally accepted resolution to the Black Hole Information Paradox has not yet been found. The paradox remains an active area of research, and its resolution is expected to provide crucial insights into the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, potentially leading to a theory of quantum gravity."
