    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current, dL is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being measured.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a uniformly charged sphere, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by each infinitesimally small current element on the sphere's surface. To do this, we will integrate the Biot-Savart Law over the entire surface of the sphere.\n\nLet's first find the total current on the surface of the sphere. The surface area of the sphere is given by:\n\nA = 4 * π * R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere (0.2 meters). So,\n\nA = 4 * π * (0.2)^2 ≈ 0.50265 m²\n\nSince the sphere carries a total current of 2 A, the current density (J) on the surface of the sphere is:\n\nJ = I / A ≈ 2 A / 0.50265 m² ≈ 3.979 A/m²\n\nNow, let's consider a small area dA on the sphere's surface. The current through this small area is given by:\n\ndI = J * dA\n\nThe magnetic field dB at a point 0.1 meters from the center of the sphere due to this small current is given by the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nSince we are considering a uniformly charged sphere, the magnetic field at the point 0.1 meters from the center will be the same in all directions. Therefore, we can integrate the above equation over the entire surface of the sphere to find the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = ∫∫ (μ₀ * J * dA * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the sphere, the magnetic field contributions from opposite points on the sphere will cancel each other out. This means that the net magnetic field at a point 0.1 meters from the center of the sphere will be zero.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.1 meters from the center of the uniformly charged sphere is 0 T (tesla)."
