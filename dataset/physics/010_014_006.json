The flow ahead of the shock is at a pressure of 101.3 kPa and a temperature of 288 K. Assume that the flow is isentropic behind the shock wave.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shock wave angle and the pressure ratio across the shock wave, we need to use the oblique shock relations. First, let's find the speed of sound at 10,000 meters altitude. We can use the standard atmosphere model to estimate the temperature at this altitude:\n\nT = T0 - L * h\nwhere T0 = 288 K (sea level standard temperature), L = 0.0065 K/m (temperature lapse rate), and h = 10,000 m (altitude).\n\nT = 288 - 0.0065 * 10,000 = 223 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed of sound (a) using the equation:\n\na = sqrt(γ * R * T)\nwhere γ = 1.4 (ratio of specific heats for air), R = 287 J/(kg*K) (specific gas constant for air), and T = 223 K (temperature at 10,000 meters altitude).\n\na = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 223) ≈ 295.5 m/s\n\nSince the rocket is traveling at Mach 2, its velocity (V) is:\n\nV = M * a\nwhere M = 2 (Mach number).\n\nV = 2 * 295.5 ≈ 591 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the shock wave angle (β) using the Mach angle equation:\n\nsin(μ) = 1/M\nwhere μ is the Mach angle.\n\nμ = arcsin(1/2) ≈ 30°\n\nFor an attached oblique shock, the shock wave angle (β) is always greater than the Mach angle (μ). Therefore, we can estimate the shock wave angle to be around 45°.\n\nNext, we can calculate the pressure ratio across the shock wave using the normal shock relations. First, we need to find the normal component of the velocity (Vn) across the shock wave:\n\nVn = V * sin(β - μ)\nwhere β ≈ 45° and μ ≈ 30°.\n\nVn = 591 * sin(45 - 30) ≈ 295.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the normal Mach number (Mn) ahead of the shock:\n\nMn = Vn / a\nMn = 295.5 / 295.5 = 1\n\nUsing the normal shock relations for pressure ratio (P2/P1) for a given Mach number:\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * γ * M^2 - (γ - 1))/(γ + 1)\nwhere M = 1 (normal Mach number) and γ = 1.4.\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * 1.4 * 1^2 - (1.4 - 1))/(1.4 + 1) ≈ 2.8\n\nSo, the pressure ratio across the shock wave is approximately 2.8.\n\nIn conclusion, the shock wave angle is approximately 45°, and the pressure ratio across the shock wave is approximately 2.8."
