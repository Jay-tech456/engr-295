    "message_1": "A monochromatic light ray is incident on the interface between glass and air at an angle of 50°. If the refractive indices of the glass and air are 1.6 and 1.0 respectively, what is the critical angle for total internal reflection to occur?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (glass and air in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90°.\n\nFor total internal reflection:\nn1 * sin(θ1_critical) = n2 * sin(90°)\n\nWe are given the refractive indices of glass (n1 = 1.6) and air (n2 = 1.0). We can now solve for the critical angle (θ1_critical):\n\n1.6 * sin(θ1_critical) = 1.0 * sin(90°)\nsin(θ1_critical) = 1.0 / 1.6\nθ1_critical = arcsin(1.0 / 1.6)\n\nθ1_critical ≈ 38.21°\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection to occur at the interface between glass and air is approximately 38.21°."
