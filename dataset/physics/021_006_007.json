Calculate this distance for a planet with the same mass and density as Earth, and for a planet with 10 times the mass and 2 times the radius of Jupiter.

    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum distance a planet can be from a black hole without being pulled into it by tidal forces, we need to find the Roche limit. The Roche limit is the minimum distance at which a celestial body, held together only by its own gravity, will disintegrate due to tidal forces exceeding the gravitational forces that hold the celestial body together.\n\nThe Roche limit (d) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nd = R * (2 * (M_bh / M_p)^(1/3))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the planet, M_bh is the mass of the black hole, and M_p is the mass of the planet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Roche limit for a planet with the same mass and density as Earth. The mass of Earth (M_p1) is approximately 5.97 * 10^24 kg, and its radius (R1) is approximately 6,371 km or 6.371 * 10^6 m. We'll assume the black hole has a mass of 10 solar masses (M_bh = 1.989 * 10^31 kg).\n\nd1 = R1 * (2 * (M_bh / M_p1)^(1/3))\nd1 = 6.371 * 10^6 m * (2 * (1.989 * 10^31 kg / 5.97 * 10^24 kg)^(1/3))\nd1 ≈ 2.44 * 10^7 m\n\nThe minimum distance for the Earth-like planet is approximately 24.4 million meters (24,400 km) from the black hole.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Roche limit for a planet with 10 times the mass and 2 times the radius of Jupiter. The mass of Jupiter (M_J) is approximately 1.898 * 10^27 kg, and its radius (R_J) is approximately 69,911 km or 6.9911 * 10^7 m. The mass of the second planet (M_p2) is 10 * M_J = 1.898 * 10^28 kg, and its radius (R2) is 2 * R_J = 1.39822 * 10^8 m.\n\nd2 = R2 * (2 * (M_bh / M_p2)^(1/3))\nd2 = 1.39822 * 10^8 m * (2 * (1.989 * 10^31 kg / 1.898 * 10^28 kg)^(1/3))\nd2 ≈ 3.49 * 10^8 m\n\nThe minimum distance for the Jupiter-like planet is approximately 349 million meters (349,000 km) from the black hole.\n\nAs for other noticeable effects from the black hole's gravitational pull, both planets would experience gravitational time dilation, meaning that time would pass more slowly for them compared to an observer far away from the black hole. Additionally, the planets would be subjected to gravitational lensing, which would cause the light from stars behind the black hole to be bent and distorted, creating a unique visual effect known as an \"Einstein ring.\""
