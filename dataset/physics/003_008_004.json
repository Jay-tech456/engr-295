    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a point above the center of the sheet, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current per unit length, and d is the distance from the point to the sheet.\n\nFirst, we need to find the current per unit length. Since the current is uniformly distributed throughout the area of the sheet, we can divide the total current by the width of the sheet to find the current per unit length:\n\nI_total = 5 A\nWidth = 0.2 m\n\nI = I_total / Width\nI = 5 A / 0.2 m\nI = 25 A/m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 25 A/m) / (2 * π * 0.4 m)\n\nB = (10^(-7) * 100 Tm) / (0.8 m)\n\nB = 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a point 0.4 m above the center of the sheet is 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
