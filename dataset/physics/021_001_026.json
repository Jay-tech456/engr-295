    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a collapsing star, the size of its event horizon, and the formation of a black hole can be described using the concept of the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the critical radius at which a mass becomes so dense that it forms a black hole, with an event horizon from which nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere:\n- Rs is the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon)\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the collapsing star\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nWhen a massive star reaches the end of its life, it can undergo gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of a black hole if its mass is above a certain threshold (approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun). As the star collapses, its density increases, and if the radius of the collapsing star becomes smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, an event horizon forms, creating a black hole.\n\nThe mass of the collapsing star (M) is directly proportional to the size of the event horizon (Rs), as seen in the formula for the Schwarzschild radius. This means that as the mass of the star increases, so does the size of the event horizon. In other words, more massive black holes have larger event horizons.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the mass of a collapsing star, the size of its event horizon, and the formation of a black hole is described by the Schwarzschild radius. The mass of the star determines if a black hole will form and the size of the event horizon, with more massive stars forming larger black holes with larger event horizons."
