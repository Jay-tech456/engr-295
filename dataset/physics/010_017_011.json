The plate is subjected to sinusoidal excitation in its own plane with acceleration g. If the amplitude of oscillation is small compared to L and B, then calculate the frequency of oscillation and the drag force acting on the plate assuming the flow to be two-dimensional and steady.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the motion of the plate and the fluid dynamics around it. Since the amplitude of oscillation is small compared to L and B, we can use the linearized potential flow theory to analyze the flow around the plate.\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of oscillation. The plate is subjected to sinusoidal excitation in its own plane with acceleration g. The equation of motion for the plate can be written as:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(ω * t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the plate, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. The acceleration of the plate is the second derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\na(t) = d²x(t) / dt² = -ω² * A * sin(ω * t)\n\nSince the acceleration is given as g, we can equate the two expressions for acceleration:\n\ng = -ω² * A * sin(ω * t)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angular frequency ω:\n\nω = sqrt(g / A)\n\nThe frequency of oscillation, f, is related to the angular frequency by:\n\nf = ω / (2 * π)\n\nNow, let's find the drag force acting on the plate. In potential flow theory, the drag force on a body is given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem:\n\nF_D = ρ * Γ * U\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, ρ is the fluid density, Γ is the circulation around the plate, and U is the velocity of the plate. Since the plate is oscillating sinusoidally, its velocity can be written as:\n\nU(t) = d(x(t)) / dt = A * ω * cos(ω * t)\n\nThe circulation around the plate can be found using the Kutta condition, which states that the circulation is such that the flow leaves the trailing edge of the plate smoothly. For a rectangular plate, the circulation can be approximated as:\n\nΓ = -2 * π * A * U(t)\n\nSubstituting this expression for circulation into the drag force equation, we get:\n\nF_D = ρ * (-2 * π * A * U(t)) * U(t)\n\nF_D = -2 * π * ρ * A * (A * ω * cos(ω * t))^2\n\nSince we are interested in the steady drag force, we can take the time average of this expression:\n\nF_D_avg = -(1/T) * ∫(2 * π * ρ * A * (A * ω * cos(ω * t))^2) dt, from 0 to T\n\nwhere T is the period of oscillation, T = 1/f.\n\nAfter integrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nF_D_avg = -(2/3) * π * ρ * A² * ω³\n\nNow we have expressions for both the frequency of oscillation and the steady drag force acting on the plate:\n\nFrequency of oscillation, f = ω / (2 * π) = sqrt(g / A) / (2 * π)\n\nSteady drag force, F_D_avg = -(2/3) * π * ρ * A² * ω³"
