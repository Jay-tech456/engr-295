    "message_1": "What is the internal energy of a system made up of 2 moles of an ideal gas at a temperature of 300 K? Given that the molar heat capacity at constant volume of the gas is 20.8 J/molK and the gas constant R is 8.314 J/molK.",
    "message_2": "To find the internal energy of the system, we can use the formula:\n\nInternal Energy (U) = n * C_v * T\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, C_v is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2 moles\nC_v = 20.8 J/molK\nT = 300 K\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nU = 2 moles * 20.8 J/molK * 300 K\n\nU = 2 * 20.8 * 300\n\nU = 41.6 * 300\n\nU = 12480 J\n\nSo, the internal energy of the system is 12,480 Joules."
