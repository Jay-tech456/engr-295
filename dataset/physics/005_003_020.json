A second spaceship moves at a velocity of 0.8c in the positive y-direction relative to the first spaceship. What is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the Earth?",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the Earth, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is given by:\n\nV = (V1 + V2) / (1 + (V1 * V2) / c^2)\n\nwhere V is the relative velocity between the second spaceship and the Earth, V1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to the Earth (0.6c), and V2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship (0.8c).\n\nHowever, since the velocities are in perpendicular directions (x and y), we need to find the magnitude of the combined velocity vector. We can do this by finding the x and y components of the second spaceship's velocity relative to the Earth and then using the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the combined velocity vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the x and y components of the second spaceship's velocity relative to the Earth:\n\nVx = V1 + V2x / (1 + (V1 * V2x) / c^2)\nVy = V2y / (1 + (V1 * V2y) / c^2)\n\nSince the second spaceship is moving in the positive y-direction relative to the first spaceship, V2x = 0 and V2y = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the equations, we get:\n\nVx = 0.6c\nVy = (0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation for Vy, we get:\n\nVy = (0.8c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nVy = (0.8c) / 1.48\n\nVy ≈ 0.54c\n\nNow that we have the x and y components of the second spaceship's velocity relative to the Earth, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the combined velocity vector:\n\nV = sqrt(Vx^2 + Vy^2)\n\nV = sqrt((0.6c)^2 + (0.54c)^2)\n\nV ≈ 0.81c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the Earth is approximately 0.81c."
