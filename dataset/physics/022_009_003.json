    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of gamma rays detection from the annihilation of dark matter particles, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The number density of dark matter particles (n_DM) in the given volume.\n2. The annihilation cross-section (σv) of the dark matter particles.\n3. The volume of the spherical region (V).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number density of dark matter particles:\n\nn_DM = dark matter density / mass of dark matter particle\nn_DM = (0.3 GeV/cm³) / (10 GeV)\nn_DM = 0.03 cm^(-3)\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of the spherical region:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\nV = (4/3) * π * (10 kpc)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * (10 * 3.086e21 cm)^3\nV ≈ 1.24e68 cm³\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of dark matter particles (N_DM) in the spherical region:\n\nN_DM = n_DM * V\nN_DM = 0.03 cm^(-3) * 1.24e68 cm³\nN_DM ≈ 3.72e66\n\nNow, we can calculate the annihilation rate (R) of dark matter particles:\n\nR = 0.5 * N_DM * (σv) * n_DM\nR = 0.5 * 3.72e66 * (3e-26 cm³/s) * 0.03 cm^(-3)\n\n(Note that we multiply by 0.5 because each annihilation event involves two dark matter particles.)\n\nR ≈ 1.67e40 s^(-1)\n\nSo, the rate of gamma rays detection from the annihilation of 10 GeV dark matter particles within a spherical region of radius 10 kpc centered at the galactic center is approximately 1.67e40 per second."
