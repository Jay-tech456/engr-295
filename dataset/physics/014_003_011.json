    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation with a wavelength of 1.064 mm, we can use the formula:\n\nc = λ * f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), λ is the wavelength (1.064 mm), and f is the frequency we want to find.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength to meters:\n\n1.064 mm = 1.064 x 10^-3 m\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to solve for the frequency:\n\nf = c / λ\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.064 x 10^-3 m)\n\nf ≈ 2.82 x 10^11 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the CMB radiation with a wavelength of 1.064 mm is approximately 2.82 x 10^11 Hz.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is the remnant radiation from the early universe, specifically from the time when the universe was about 380,000 years old. It provides valuable information about the early universe, such as:\n\n1. The age of the universe: By studying the CMB, scientists have determined that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old.\n\n2. The composition of the universe: The CMB has helped to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe.\n\n3. The large-scale structure of the universe: The CMB contains small temperature fluctuations, which are the seeds of the large-scale structures (galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc.) that we observe today.\n\n4. The geometry of the universe: The CMB has provided evidence that the universe is flat, meaning that the geometry of space is Euclidean on large scales.\n\n5. The inflationary epoch: The CMB supports the theory of cosmic inflation, which posits that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the first moments after the Big Bang. This theory helps to explain the uniformity of the CMB and the large-scale structure of the universe."
