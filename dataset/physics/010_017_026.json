The water density is 1000 kg/m³ and the plate density is 2500 kg/m³. Determine the resonant frequency of vibrations of the plate in the water if the spring constant of the material is 3x10⁹ N/m³.",
    "message_2": "To determine the resonant frequency of the plate in water, we need to consider the mass of the plate, the spring constant of the material, and the added mass due to the water.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the plate:\nVolume of the plate = length × width × thickness = 0.5 m × 0.2 m × thickness\nLet's assume the thickness of the plate is t meters.\nVolume = 0.1t m³\n\nMass of the plate = volume × density = 0.1t × 2500 kg/m³ = 250t kg\n\nNow, let's find the added mass due to the water. The added mass is the mass of water displaced by the plate when it vibrates. For a rectangular plate, the added mass (m_a) can be approximated as:\n\nm_a = 2πρ_water × width × thickness / 4\nm_a = 2π × 1000 kg/m³ × 0.2 m × t / 4\nm_a = 100πt kg\n\nThe total mass (m_total) is the sum of the mass of the plate and the added mass due to the water:\n\nm_total = 250t + 100πt = (250 + 100π)t kg\n\nNow, we can find the resonant frequency (f) using the formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) × √(k / m_total)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant of the material (3 × 10⁹ N/m³).\n\nf = (1 / 2π) × √(3 × 10⁹ N/m³ / (250 + 100π)t kg)\n\nSince we don't have the value of the thickness (t), we cannot find the exact value of the resonant frequency. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the resonant frequency for any given thickness of the plate."
