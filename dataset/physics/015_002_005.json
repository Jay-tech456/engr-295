    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger GW170817, we need to know the masses of the two neutron stars and the time frame in which the merger occurred. The distance from Earth is not directly relevant to the frequency calculation.\n\nThe masses of the two neutron stars in the GW170817 event were approximately 1.17 and 1.60 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of the Sun, approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg). The merger occurred over a time frame of about 100 seconds.\n\nWe can use the chirp mass formula to estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves. The chirp mass (Mc) is given by:\n\nMc = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars.\n\nUsing the given masses:\n\nMc = (1.17 * 1.60)^(3/5) / (1.17 + 1.60)^(1/5)\nMc ≈ 1.188 solar masses\n\nNow, we can use the chirp mass and the time frame of the merger to estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves. The frequency (f) is given by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/8) * (Mc / T^(3/5))\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2), and T is the time frame of the merger (100 seconds).\n\nConverting the chirp mass to kg:\n\nMc ≈ 1.188 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nMc ≈ 2.362 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2) * (5/8) * (2.362 x 10^30 kg / 100^(3/5) s)\nf ≈ 70.4 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger GW170817 is approximately 70.4 Hz."
