    "message_2": "Designing an experiment to detect gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) requires a multi-step approach. Here's a possible plan:\n\n1. Identify the target: Intermediate-mass black holes are black holes with masses between 100 and 100,000 solar masses. They are expected to form through the merger of smaller black holes or the collapse of massive stars. Their gravitational wave signatures would be different from those of smaller stellar-mass black holes or larger supermassive black holes.\n\n2. Choose the appropriate detector: Gravitational waves from IMBHs are expected to have frequencies in the range of millihertz to hertz. Current ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to frequencies above 10 Hz, which is not ideal for detecting IMBHs. Instead, space-based detectors like the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) would be more suitable, as they are designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz range.\n\n3. Develop a data analysis strategy: To maximize the chances of detecting gravitational waves from IMBHs, we need to develop data analysis techniques that can identify their unique signatures in the detector data. This may involve matched filtering, where we compare the data to a library of theoretical IMBH waveforms, or machine learning algorithms that can recognize the characteristic patterns of IMBH mergers.\n\n4. Perform a targeted search: Since IMBHs are expected to form in dense stellar environments like globular clusters or galactic nuclei, we can perform a targeted search for gravitational waves from these regions. This would involve analyzing the detector data for signals coming from the direction of known globular clusters or galactic nuclei.\n\n5. Confirm the observations: To confirm the existence of IMBHs, we need to gather additional evidence from other astronomical observations. This may include:\n\n   a. Electromagnetic counterparts: If the IMBH merger is accompanied by the emission of electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X-rays or gamma rays), we can use telescopes to observe these counterparts and confirm the event's astrophysical origin.\n\n   b. Dynamical evidence: Observations of the motion of stars or gas in the vicinity of the IMBH can provide indirect evidence for its existence. For example, if stars are observed to be moving faster than expected, this could be due to the gravitational influence of an unseen IMBH.\n\n   c. Statistical analysis: By analyzing the properties of multiple IMBH merger events, we can build a statistical case for their existence. This would involve comparing the observed distribution of IMBH masses, merger rates, and other properties to theoretical predictions.\n\nIn summary, detecting gravitational waves from intermediate-mass black holes requires a combination of appropriate detectors, data analysis techniques, targeted searches, and multi-messenger observations. The upcoming LISA mission, along with ground-based telescopes and other astronomical facilities, will play a crucial role in this endeavor."
