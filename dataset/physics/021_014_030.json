    "message_2": "The correlation between the mass of a black hole and the luminosity of the quasar it powers is described by the Eddington luminosity limit. The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity that a black hole can achieve through the process of accretion, where the gravitational force pulling matter inwards is balanced by the radiation pressure pushing it outwards. The Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) is proportional to the mass (M) of the black hole:\n\nL_Edd = k * M\n\nwhere k is a constant that depends on the efficiency of the accretion process and the mass-to-light conversion factor.\n\nThis relationship supports the theory that quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies because the observed luminosities of quasars are consistent with the Eddington luminosity limit for black holes with masses in the range of millions to billions of solar masses. The fact that the luminosity of quasars is directly related to the mass of the central black hole implies that the energy output of quasars is primarily due to the accretion of matter onto these supermassive black holes.\n\nFurthermore, the observed correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the luminosity of the quasar is consistent with the predictions of the accretion theory. As the mass of the black hole increases, so does the gravitational force it exerts on the surrounding matter, leading to a higher accretion rate and, consequently, a higher luminosity. This correlation has been observed in many quasars and active galactic nuclei, providing strong evidence that these objects are indeed powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies."
