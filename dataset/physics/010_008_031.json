Calculate the buoyant force acting on the object and determine the volume of water displaced by the object. Given that the density of the water is 1000 kg/m³ and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s².",
    "message_2": "To calculate the buoyant force acting on the object, we first need to determine the volume of the object. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can calculate the volume:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (0.1)³\nV ≈ 0.00419 m³\n\nNow that we have the volume of the object, we can determine the volume of water displaced by the object, which is equal to the volume of the object:\n\nVolume of water displaced = 0.00419 m³\n\nNext, we can calculate the buoyant force acting on the object using Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object:\n\nBuoyant force (F_b) = Density of water (ρ) * Volume of water displaced (V) * Acceleration due to gravity (g)\n\nGiven the density of water ρ = 1000 kg/m³ and acceleration due to gravity g = 9.81 m/s², we can calculate the buoyant force:\n\nF_b = 1000 * 0.00419 * 9.81\nF_b ≈ 41.1 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the object is approximately 41.1 N, and the volume of water displaced by the object is 0.00419 m³."
