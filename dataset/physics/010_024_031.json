    "message_1": "What is the minimum mass a star must have in order to undergo nuclear fusion and become a main sequence star, assuming it is composed of pure hydrogen gas and at a temperature of 10 million Kelvin?",
    "message_2": "The minimum mass a star must have in order to undergo nuclear fusion and become a main sequence star is determined by the conditions required for the fusion of hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form helium. This process, known as the proton-proton chain, requires high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between protons.\n\nThe minimum mass required for a star to sustain nuclear fusion is approximately 0.08 solar masses, or about 80 times the mass of Jupiter. This value is derived from theoretical models and observations of the lowest-mass main sequence stars, known as red dwarfs. At this mass, the core temperature and pressure are sufficient to sustain hydrogen fusion, allowing the star to enter the main sequence phase of its life."
