    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity (specific heat) of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy applied (in Joules), m is the mass of the water (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Mass of water (m) = 50 grams\n- Initial temperature (T1) = 25°C\n- Final temperature (T2) = 45°C\n- Heat energy applied (Q) = 500 Joules\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 45°C - 25°C = 20°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (m * ΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 500 J / (50 g * 20°C) = 500 J / 1000 g°C = 0.5 J/g°C\n\nThe heat capacity of the 50 grams of water is 0.5 J/g°C."
