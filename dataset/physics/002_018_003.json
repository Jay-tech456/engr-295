    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the ideal gas law and Boyle's law. The ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nBoyle's law states that for a given amount of gas at constant temperature, the product of pressure and volume is constant:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nwhere P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume.\n\nWe are given the initial volume (V1) as 2 L, the initial pressure (P1) as 5 atm, and the final volume (V2) as 1 L. We need to find the final pressure (P2) and the Boyle temperature (T).\n\nFirst, let's find the final pressure (P2) using Boyle's law:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n5 atm * 2 L = P2 * 1 L\n10 atm = P2\n\nSo, the final pressure (P2) is 10 atm.\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the temperature (T). Since the temperature is constant, we can write the ideal gas law for both the initial and final states:\n\nP1V1 = nRT1\nP2V2 = nRT2\n\nSince T1 = T2 (constant temperature), we can write:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nWe already found P2, so we can solve for T:\n\n5 atm * 2 L = 10 atm * 1 L\n10 atm * L = nRT\n\nSince we are not given the number of moles (n) or the value of R, we cannot find the exact value of the temperature (T). However, we can express the temperature in terms of n and R:\n\nT = (10 atm * L) / (nR)\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature of the gas is (10 atm * L) / (nR)."
