    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n=1) to the n=3 excited state, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = E3 - E1 = -13.6 eV * (1/n3² - 1/n1²)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E3 is the energy of the n=3 state, E1 is the energy of the n=1 state, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n3:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/3² - 1/1²)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/9 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-8/9)\n\nΔE ≈ 12.1 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state to the n=3 excited state is approximately 12.1 electron volts (eV)."
