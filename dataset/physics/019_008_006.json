    "message_2": "The anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is a measure of the deviation of the electron's magnetic moment from the classical prediction given by the Dirac equation. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), this deviation can be calculated using perturbation theory, where the interaction between the electron and the electromagnetic field is treated as a small perturbation.\n\nTo third-order perturbation theory, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron (a_e) is given by the famous Schwinger's formula:\n\na_e = (α / 2π) + K_2 (α / π)^2 + K_3 (α / π)^3 + ...\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant, and K_2 and K_3 are numerical constants that depend on the details of the third-order QED calculations. The fine-structure constant α is approximately equal to 1/137.\n\nThe first term (α / 2π) is the leading-order contribution, and it is already quite accurate. The second and third terms represent the second and third-order corrections, respectively. The values of K_2 and K_3 are known from extensive QED calculations:\n\nK_2 ≈ 0.328\nK_3 ≈ 1.181\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of α, K_2, and K_3 to calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron to third-order perturbation theory:\n\na_e ≈ (1/137) / (2π) + 0.328 * (1/137)^2 / π^2 + 1.181 * (1/137)^3 / π^3\na_e ≈ 0.00116 + 0.00000044 + 0.000000002\n\nTo an accuracy of 3 decimal places, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is:\n\na_e ≈ 0.001 (3 decimal places)"
