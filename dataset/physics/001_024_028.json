    "message_2": "In the context of quantum thermodynamics and information theory, the minimum amount of energy required to erase one bit of classical information is given by Landauer's principle. Landauer's principle states that the minimum energy required to erase one bit of information is given by the product of the Boltzmann constant (k) and the temperature (T) of the system, multiplied by the natural logarithm of 2.\n\nE = k * T * ln(2)\n\nHowever, the problem states that the system is at absolute zero temperature. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, where the temperature is exactly 0 Kelvin (0K).\n\nIn this case, since the temperature T = 0K, the minimum energy required to erase one bit of classical information would be:\n\nE = k * 0K * ln(2) = 0\n\nAt absolute zero temperature, the minimum energy required to erase one bit of classical information is 0. However, it's important to note that reaching absolute zero temperature is practically impossible according to the third law of thermodynamics."
