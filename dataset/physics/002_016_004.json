    "message_1": "Calculating critical temperature of a substance may differ for different equations of state. For a Van der Waals gas, the critical temperature is given by the formula Tc = (8a/27Rb) where a and b are constants for the gas.\n\nIf the Van der Waals constants for propane are a = 5.590 and b = 0.0274, what is its critical temperature?",
    "message_2": "Given the Van der Waals constants for propane are a = 5.590 and b = 0.0274, we can calculate the critical temperature using the formula Tc = (8a/27Rb).\n\nFirst, we need to know the value of the gas constant R. The universal gas constant R is approximately 8.314 J/(mol·K).\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nTc = (8 * 5.590) / (27 * 8.314 * 0.0274)\n\nTc = 44.72 / (27 * 8.314 * 0.0274)\n\nTc ≈ 44.72 / (6.023 * 0.227916)\n\nTc ≈ 44.72 / 1.372\n\nTc ≈ 32.6 K\n\nTherefore, the critical temperature of propane is approximately 32.6 K."
