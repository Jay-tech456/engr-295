    "message_1": "A physics student measures the temperature change of 250 grams of water when heated with 500 Joules of energy. The initial temperature of water was 20°C and it rose to 50°C after absorbing the energy. Calculate the specific heat capacity of water in J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the energy absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass of the water (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nQ = 500 J\nm = 250 g\nΔT = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C\n\nWe need to solve for c:\n\n500 J = 250 g × c × 30°C\n\nNow, we can isolate c by dividing both sides by (250 g × 30°C):\n\nc = 500 J / (250 g × 30°C)\nc = 500 J / 7500 g°C\nc ≈ 0.0667 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of water in this case is approximately 0.0667 J/g°C."
