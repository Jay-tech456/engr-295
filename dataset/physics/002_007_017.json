    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed (in joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nQ = 500 J\nm = 250 g\nΔT = 10°C\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 500 J / (250 g × 10°C)\n\nc = 500 J / 2500 g°C\n\nc = 0.2 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the block of aluminum is 0.2 J/g°C."
