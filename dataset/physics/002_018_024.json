    "message_2": "The Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a gas's pressure and volume are inversely proportional, while the number of moles and the gas constant remain constant. In this case, we are given the initial volume (V1), pressure (P1), and temperature (T1) of the gas, as well as the final pressure (P2). We are asked to find the final temperature (T2) when the volume remains constant.\n\nSince the gas follows the ideal gas law, we can use the equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWe are given that the number of moles and the gas constant remain constant, so we can write the initial and final conditions as:\n\nP1V1 = nR(T1)\nP2V2 = nR(T2)\n\nSince the volume remains constant (V1 = V2), we can write:\n\nP1V = nR(T1)\nP2V = nR(T2)\n\nNow, we can divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(P2V) / (P1V) = (nR(T2)) / (nR(T1))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nP2 / P1 = T2 / T1\n\nWe are given P1 = 1 atm, P2 = 0.5 atm, and T1 = 25°C. First, we need to convert the initial temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1(K) = T1(°C) + 273.15\nT1(K) = 25 + 273.15\nT1(K) = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nT2 / T1 = P2 / P1\nT2 / 298.15 = 0.5 / 1\nT2 = 298.15 * 0.5\nT2 = 149.075 K\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature (T2) of the gas sample is approximately 149.075 K when its pressure is reduced to 0.5 atm while maintaining its initial volume."
