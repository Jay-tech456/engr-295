    "message_2": "The interaction of gamma-ray photons with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation becomes significant when the energy of the gamma-ray photon is high enough to produce electron-positron pairs through the interaction with CMB photons. This process is known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit.\n\nThe threshold energy for this interaction can be determined by considering the conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame of the colliding photons. The threshold condition for electron-positron pair production is:\n\nE_gamma * E_CMB * (1 - cosθ) ≥ (m_e * c^2)^2,\n\nwhere E_gamma is the energy of the gamma-ray photon, E_CMB is the energy of the CMB photon, θ is the angle between the momenta of the two photons, m_e is the electron mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe CMB radiation has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The peak energy of the CMB photons can be estimated using Wien's displacement law:\n\nE_CMB ≈ 3.3 * k_B * T,\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. For T = 2.7 K, E_CMB ≈ 6.1 x 10^(-4) eV.\n\nAssuming a head-on collision (cosθ = -1) for the most efficient interaction, we can rewrite the threshold condition as:\n\nE_gamma * 2 * E_CMB ≥ (m_e * c^2)^2.\n\nThe electron mass energy is m_e * c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV, or 511 keV. Solving for E_gamma, we get:\n\nE_gamma ≥ (m_e * c^2)^2 / (2 * E_CMB) ≈ (511 keV)^2 / (2 * 6.1 x 10^(-4) eV) ≈ 2.15 x 10^(11) eV.\n\nSo, the maximum energy that a gamma-ray photon can have before its interaction with the cosmic microwave background radiation becomes significant is approximately 2.15 x 10^(11) eV, or 215 EeV (exaelectronvolts)."
