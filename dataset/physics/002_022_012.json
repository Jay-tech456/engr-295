    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient (γ) of a substance in a solution, we can use the Debye-Hückel equation for electrolyte solutions or the van't Hoff factor for non-electrolyte solutions. However, since we are given an interaction parameter, it seems we are dealing with a non-ideal solution. In this case, we can use the Wilson equation to calculate the activity coefficient.\n\nThe Wilson equation is given by:\n\nln(γ) = -ln(x + (1 - x) * λ) + (1 - x) * (λ / (x + (1 - x) * λ))\n\nwhere γ is the activity coefficient, x is the mole fraction of the substance, and λ is the interaction parameter.\n\nGiven the mole fraction (x) = 0.4 and the interaction parameter (λ) = -0.3, we can plug these values into the Wilson equation:\n\nln(γ) = -ln(0.4 + (1 - 0.4) * (-0.3)) + (1 - 0.4) * (-0.3 / (0.4 + (1 - 0.4) * (-0.3)))\n\nln(γ) = -ln(0.4 + 0.6 * (-0.3)) + 0.6 * (-0.3 / (0.4 + 0.6 * (-0.3)))\n\nln(γ) = -ln(0.4 - 0.18) + 0.6 * (-0.3 / (0.22))\n\nln(γ) = -ln(0.22) + 0.6 * (-0.3 / 0.22)\n\nln(γ) = -ln(0.22) - 0.8182\n\nNow, to find the activity coefficient (γ), we can take the exponent of both sides:\n\nγ = exp(-ln(0.22) - 0.8182)\n\nγ ≈ 2.29\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of the substance in the solution is approximately 2.29."
