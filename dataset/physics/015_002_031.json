    "message_2": "To determine the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we need to know the masses of the merging neutron stars and the final moments of the inspiral phase before the merger. The frequency of gravitational waves can be calculated using the chirp mass formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/96 * π^(-8/3) * (M_chirp)^(5/3) * (t_c - t)^(3/8)))^(3/2)\n\nwhere:\nf is the frequency of the gravitational waves,\nc is the speed of light,\nG is the gravitational constant,\nM_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system,\nt_c is the time of coalescence (merger),\nt is the time before coalescence,\nand π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the masses of the neutron stars and the time of coalescence, it is impossible to provide an exact frequency for the gravitational waves emitted by the recent neutron star merger detected by LIGO and Virgo observatories.\n\nIn general, the frequency of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers can range from a few tens of Hz to a few kHz, with the frequency increasing as the neutron stars approach each other and eventually merge. The exact frequency depends on the specific properties of the merging neutron stars."
