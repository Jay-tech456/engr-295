    "message_2": "To find the maximum speed at which a galaxy can recede from us, we can use the Hubble's Law formula:\n\nv = H0 * d\n\nwhere v is the recessional velocity of the galaxy, H0 is the Hubble parameter, and d is the distance to the galaxy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance to the galaxy using its redshift (z = 10). The formula to find the distance using redshift is:\n\nd = c * (z + 1) / H0\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s), z is the redshift, and H0 is the Hubble parameter.\n\nd = (300,000 km/s) * (10 + 1) / (70 km/s/Mpc)\nd ≈ 47.14 Mpc\n\nNow, we can use Hubble's Law to find the maximum speed at which the galaxy can recede from us:\n\nv = H0 * d\nv = (70 km/s/Mpc) * (47.14 Mpc)\nv ≈ 3300 km/s\n\nSo, the maximum speed at which a galaxy with a redshift of 10 can recede from us in a universe with a Hubble parameter of 70 km/s/Mpc is approximately 3300 km/s."
