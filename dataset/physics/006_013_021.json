    "message_2": "To calculate the tunneling probability of an electron through an energy barrier, we can use the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential well. The tunneling probability can be estimated using the transmission coefficient (T) which is given by the formula:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the decay constant, and L is the width of the potential barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant K, which is given by:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron, V is the potential barrier height, E is the energy of the electron, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nGiven the barrier height (V) is 1 eV, and the electron's energy is 1/5 of the barrier height, we have:\n\nE = V / 5 = 1 eV / 5 = 0.2 eV\n\nNow, we need to convert the energy values from eV to Joules:\n\n1 eV = 1.6 x 10^(-19) J\n\nV = 1 eV * 1.6 x 10^(-19) J/eV = 1.6 x 10^(-19) J\nE = 0.2 eV * 1.6 x 10^(-19) J/eV = 0.32 x 10^(-19) J\n\nThe mass of an electron (m) is 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg, and the reduced Planck constant (hbar) is 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js.\n\nNow we can calculate the decay constant K:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg * (1.6 x 10^(-19) J - 0.32 x 10^(-19) J) / (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js)^2)\nK ≈ 1.026 x 10^10 m^(-1)\n\nThe width of the potential barrier (L) is given as 0.05 nm, which we need to convert to meters:\n\nL = 0.05 nm * 10^(-9) m/nm = 5 x 10^(-11) m\n\nNow we can calculate the transmission coefficient (T):\n\nT = e^(-2 * 1.026 x 10^10 m^(-1) * 5 x 10^(-11) m)\nT ≈ 1.52 x 10^(-9)\n\nSo, the probability of an electron tunneling through the energy barrier is approximately 1.52 x 10^(-9) or 0.000000152%."
