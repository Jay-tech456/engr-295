    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, which is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has a mass of about 125.1 GeV/c² and is unstable, decaying into other particles shortly after being produced.\n\n1. Decay into two W bosons and a Z boson:\n\nThis decay mode is not possible for a single Higgs boson because it violates the conservation of electric charge. A Higgs boson can decay into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-) or a pair of Z bosons, but not a combination of both. Let's discuss these two separate decay modes:\n\na) Higgs boson decaying into two W bosons (W+ and W-):\n\nIn this decay mode, the Higgs boson decays into a W+ boson and a W- boson. The W bosons are massive, with a mass of about 80.4 GeV/c², and carry an electric charge of +1 or -1. They are responsible for mediating the weak nuclear force. The W bosons can further decay into a lepton and a neutrino or a quark-antiquark pair. The branching ratio for this decay mode is about 21.5%.\n\nb) Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons:\n\nIn this decay mode, the Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons, which are electrically neutral and have a mass of about 91.2 GeV/c². They also mediate the weak nuclear force. The Z bosons can decay into a pair of leptons or a quark-antiquark pair. The branching ratio for this decay mode is about 2.6%.\n\n2. Decay into four leptons:\n\nThe Higgs boson can decay into four leptons through an intermediate state involving two Z bosons (H → ZZ → 4 leptons). In this decay mode, the Higgs boson first decays into two Z bosons, which then each decay into a lepton-antilepton pair. The leptons can be electrons, muons, or tau particles, along with their corresponding antiparticles.\n\nThis decay mode is considered a \"golden channel\" for Higgs boson detection because it has a very clean experimental signature, with relatively low background noise. However, the branching ratio for this decay mode is quite small, at about 0.01%.\n\nIn summary, the Higgs boson cannot decay into two W bosons and a Z boson simultaneously due to charge conservation. However, it can decay into two W bosons or two Z bosons, with the latter being a pathway to the four-lepton decay mode. The properties of the Higgs boson in these decay modes are determined by the properties of the W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak nuclear force and can decay into leptons or quarks. The four-lepton decay mode has a cleaner experimental signature but a smaller branching ratio compared to the W and Z boson decay modes."
