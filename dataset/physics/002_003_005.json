    "message_1": "A gas in a piston-cylinder system undergoes a process where the pressure decreases from 2 bar to 1 bar, and its volume increases from 1 m³ to 2 m³. If the gas initially had an internal energy of 1000 kJ, what is the final internal energy of the gas, assuming no heat transfer and work done during the process is negligible?",
    "message_2": "If there is no heat transfer and the work done during the process is negligible, then the change in internal energy is zero. This is because the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (∆U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\n∆U = Q - W\n\nIn this case, Q = 0 (no heat transfer) and W ≈ 0 (work done is negligible). Therefore, the change in internal energy is:\n\n∆U = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nSince the initial internal energy of the gas is 1000 kJ, the final internal energy of the gas will be the same:\n\nFinal internal energy = Initial internal energy + ∆U\nFinal internal energy = 1000 kJ + 0\nFinal internal energy = 1000 kJ"
