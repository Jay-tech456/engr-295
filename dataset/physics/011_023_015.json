    "message_2": "The magnetic properties of a magnetic domain wall can vary with temperature and applied magnetic field. These variations can be attributed to changes in the magnetization, domain wall energy, and domain wall mobility. To understand these variations, we can look at experimental data and theoretical models that describe the behavior of magnetic domain walls under different conditions.\n\n1. Temperature dependence:\n\nAs temperature increases, the thermal energy of the magnetic system also increases, which can lead to a reduction in the magnetization of the material. This is because the thermal energy can cause the magnetic moments to become more randomly oriented, reducing the overall magnetization. This effect is described by the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nM(T) = M0(1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nwhere M(T) is the magnetization at temperature T, M0 is the saturation magnetization, Tc is the Curie temperature, and β is a critical exponent.\n\nExperimental data supporting this behavior can be found in various studies, such as the work by Kittel (1949), where the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials was investigated.\n\n2. Applied magnetic field dependence:\n\nThe applied magnetic field can affect the magnetic domain wall properties in several ways. First, it can change the domain wall energy, which is given by the sum of the exchange energy, magnetostatic energy, and Zeeman energy. The Zeeman energy, which depends on the applied magnetic field, can cause the domain wall energy to decrease, leading to a more favorable condition for domain wall motion.\n\nSecond, the applied magnetic field can also affect the domain wall mobility. The domain wall motion is driven by the competition between the driving force (due to the applied magnetic field) and the pinning force (due to defects and inhomogeneities in the material). As the applied magnetic field increases, the driving force increases, leading to an increase in domain wall mobility.\n\nExperimental data supporting these effects can be found in studies such as the work by Hubert and Schäfer (1998), where the magnetic domain wall motion in thin films was investigated as a function of the applied magnetic field.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic properties of a magnetic domain wall can change with temperature and applied magnetic field. These changes can be attributed to variations in magnetization, domain wall energy, and domain wall mobility. Experimental data from various studies support these observations and provide a basis for understanding the behavior of magnetic domain walls under different conditions."
