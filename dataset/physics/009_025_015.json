    "message_1": "A fiber optic cable has a core diameter of 62.5 μm and a cladding diameter of 125 μm. If the refractive index of the core is 1.48 and the refractive index of the cladding is 1.45, what is the critical angle of incidence for this fiber optic cable?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence for the fiber optic cable, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of the core (1.48), and n2 is the refractive index of the cladding (1.45). The critical angle occurs when the light is refracted at an angle of 90 degrees (θ2 = 90°) along the boundary between the core and the cladding. In this situation, sin(θ2) = sin(90°) = 1.\n\nRearranging Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 / n1\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.45 / 1.48\n\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.9797\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of this value:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.9797)\n\nθ1 ≈ 78.2°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for this fiber optic cable is approximately 78.2 degrees."
