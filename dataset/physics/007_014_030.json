    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear density of a Boron-10 atom, we will use the formula for nuclear density:\n\ndensity = mass/volume\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the nucleus, which is assumed to be spherical. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nvolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius of the Boron-10 nucleus is given as 2.34 femtometers (fm).\n\nvolume = (4/3)π(2.34 fm)³ ≈ 53.76 fm³\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass of the Boron-10 atom from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 u = 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\nmass = 10.013 u × (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/u) ≈ 1.663 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n\nNow we can calculate the nuclear density:\n\ndensity = mass/volume = (1.663 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) / (53.76 fm³)\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ meters, we need to convert the volume to cubic meters:\n\n53.76 fm³ × (10⁻¹⁵ m/fm)³ = 53.76 × 10⁻⁴⁵ m³\n\nNow we can calculate the nuclear density in kg/m³:\n\ndensity = (1.663 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) / (53.76 × 10⁻⁴⁵ m³) ≈ 3.09 × 10¹⁷ kg/m³\n\nSo, the nuclear density of a Boron-10 atom is approximately 3.09 × 10¹⁷ kg/m³."
