    "message_2": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a future space-based gravitational wave observatory that is expected to be launched in the 2030s. LISA will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves compared to ground-based interferometers like LIGO, allowing it to detect different types of astronomical events.\n\nLISA is expected to detect gravitational waves from various sources, including supermassive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and galactic binary systems. The estimated rate of detections for LISA varies depending on the type of source:\n\n1. Supermassive black hole mergers: LISA is expected to detect a few to several tens of these events per year.\n2. Extreme mass ratio inspirals: LISA could detect a few to several tens of these events per year as well.\n3. Galactic binary systems: LISA will observe thousands of these systems, with the strongest signals detectable throughout the mission.\n\nIn comparison, LIGO has detected dozens of gravitational wave events since its first detection in 2015, primarily from binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers. The current rate of detections by LIGO and its partner observatory Virgo is around one event per week during observing runs.\n\nWhile LISA is expected to detect fewer supermassive black hole mergers and extreme mass ratio inspirals per year compared to LIGO's current rate of detections, it will observe a significantly larger number of galactic binary systems. Additionally, LISA's sensitivity to lower-frequency gravitational waves will enable it to probe different astrophysical phenomena and complement the observations made by ground-based interferometers like LIGO."
