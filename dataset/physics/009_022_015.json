    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to find the angle of incidence at which the reflected light from a glass surface becomes completely polarized according to Brewster's Law. The refractive index of glass is given to be 1.52. What is the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized?",
    "message_2": "According to Brewster's Law, the angle of incidence (θi) at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized can be found using the following formula:\n\ntan(θi) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (air, in this case, with a refractive index of 1) and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass, with a refractive index of 1.52).\n\ntan(θi) = 1.52 / 1\ntan(θi) = 1.52\n\nNow, to find the angle of incidence, we need to take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of both sides:\n\nθi = arctan(1.52)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθi ≈ 56.3°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized is approximately 56.3°."
