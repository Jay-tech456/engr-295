    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is the thermal radiation left over from the early stages of the universe, specifically from the time when the universe was about 380,000 years old. It is a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which describes the origin and evolution of the universe.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature of the CMB and the age of the universe can be understood through the concept of cosmic expansion. As the universe expands, the wavelength of the CMB radiation also stretches, causing the temperature to decrease. This relationship can be described by the following equation:\n\nT = T₀ / (1 + z)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the CMB at a given time, T₀ is the current temperature of the CMB (approximately 2.725 K), and z is the redshift, which is a measure of the cosmic expansion.\n\nThe age of the universe can be determined using the Hubble constant (H₀), which describes the rate of expansion of the universe. The current best estimate for the Hubble constant is about 67.4 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec). Using this value, the age of the universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years.\n\nAs the universe ages and continues to expand, the temperature of the CMB will continue to decrease. The relationship between the temperature and the age of the universe is not a simple linear one, as the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time due to the influence of dark energy and dark matter. However, the overall trend is that as the universe ages, the temperature of the CMB decreases.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is inversely proportional to the age of the universe, with the temperature decreasing as the universe expands and ages. This relationship is supported by observational evidence, such as the measurements of the CMB temperature and the Hubble constant, which are consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory."
