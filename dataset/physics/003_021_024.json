    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the transformer coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength of a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the medium, n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given that the coil has 50 turns and a diameter of 8 cm. The length of the coil can be assumed to be equal to its diameter (since it's not specified otherwise). Therefore, the length of the coil is 8 cm or 0.08 m.\n\nn = total number of turns / length\nn = 50 turns / 0.08 m\nn ≈ 625 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T⋅m/A) * (625 turns/m) * (10 A)\nB ≈ 7.854 × 10^-4 T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid. To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm (0.05 m) from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the medium, I is the current, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil.\n\nThe radius of the coil is half of its diameter, so R = 4 cm or 0.04 m.\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T⋅m/A * 10 A * (0.04 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.04 m)^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB ≈ 1.006 × 10^-4 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the transformer coil is approximately 1.006 × 10^-4 T."
