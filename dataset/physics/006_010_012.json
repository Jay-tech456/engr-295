    "message_2": "To calculate the distance of closest approach (impact parameter) for an alpha particle incident on a gold nucleus, we can use the following formula:\n\nb = (k * e^2) / (2 * K.E.)\n\nwhere:\nb = distance of closest approach (impact parameter)\nk = Coulomb's constant (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2)\ne = charge of the alpha particle (2 * elementary charge) and charge of the gold nucleus (79 * elementary charge)\nK.E. = kinetic energy of the alpha particle (5 MeV)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the kinetic energy from MeV to Joules:\n\n1 MeV = 1.60218 × 10^-13 J\n\nK.E. = 5 MeV * (1.60218 × 10^-13 J/MeV) = 8.0109 × 10^-13 J\n\nNext, we need to calculate the product of the charges of the alpha particle and the gold nucleus:\n\ne_alpha = 2 * elementary charge = 2 * (1.60218 × 10^-19 C) = 3.20436 × 10^-19 C\ne_gold = 79 * elementary charge = 79 * (1.60218 × 10^-19 C) = 1.26572 × 10^-17 C\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance of closest approach (impact parameter):\n\nb = (k * e_alpha * e_gold) / (2 * K.E.)\nb = (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2 * 3.20436 × 10^-19 C * 1.26572 × 10^-17 C) / (2 * 8.0109 × 10^-13 J)\nb = (3.086 × 10^-26 N m^2) / (1.602 × 10^-12 J)\nb = 1.927 × 10^-14 m\n\nSo, the distance of closest approach (impact parameter) for an alpha particle in the Rutherford scattering experiment when it is incident on a nucleus of gold with a kinetic energy of 5 MeV is approximately 1.927 × 10^-14 meters."
