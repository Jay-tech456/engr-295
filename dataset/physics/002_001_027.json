    "message_2": "To calculate the work done during the compression of a gas at constant pressure, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nIn this case, the initial volume (V1) is 5 L, the final volume (V2) is 3 L, and the constant pressure is 2 atm.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in volume (ΔV):\n\nΔV = V2 - V1\nΔV = 3 L - 5 L\nΔV = -2 L\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\nW = -(2 atm) * (-2 L)\n\nW = 4 L*atm\n\nThe work done during the compression of the gas is 4 L*atm. Note that the work done is positive, which means that work is done on the gas (compressing it) rather than the gas doing work on its surroundings."
