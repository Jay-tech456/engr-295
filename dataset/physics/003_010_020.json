    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we'll use Ampere's Law, which states that the integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nWe'll consider a circular Amperian loop of radius r centered at the axis of the cylindrical wire. Since the magnetic field is azimuthal (in the φ direction) and symmetrical around the axis, the integral becomes:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the Amperian loop of radius r. Since the current is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of the wire, we can find the current density (J) as:\n\nJ = I / (πR²)\n\nThe enclosed current (I_enclosed) can be found by multiplying the current density (J) by the area enclosed by the Amperian loop (πr²):\n\nI_enclosed = J * πr² = (I / (πR²)) * πr²\n\nNow, we can substitute I_enclosed back into Ampere's Law equation:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * (I / (πR²)) * πr²\n\nWe can now solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r) / (2πR²)\n\nThis is the expression for the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance r from the center of the cylinder, where r < R."
