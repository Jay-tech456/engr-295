    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we first need to find the relativistic mass of the particle. The relativistic mass (m) can be found using the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 6 grams = 0.006 kg (converting to SI units)\nv = 0.75c\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = 0.006 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.75c)^2/c^2)\nm = 0.006 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.5625)\nm = 0.006 kg / sqrt(0.4375)\nm ≈ 0.00907 kg\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy using the equation:\n\nK = (m - m0)c^2\n\nK = (0.00907 kg - 0.006 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 0.00307 kg × 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nK ≈ 2.763 × 10^14 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 2.763 × 10^14 Joules."
