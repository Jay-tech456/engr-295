    "message_2": "The evidence for the existence of interaction between dark matter and normal matter primarily comes from astrophysical and cosmological observations. Some of the key observations include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of stars and gas in galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass distribution. The observed rotation curves can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxies, which interacts gravitationally with normal matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is known as gravitational lensing. Observations of strong and weak gravitational lensing effects indicate the presence of large amounts of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe. Detailed measurements of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB provide information about the composition and evolution of the universe. The data strongly supports the existence of dark matter, which interacts with normal matter through gravity.\n\n4. Large scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the predictions of a cosmological model that includes dark matter. Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in the formation of these structures through gravitational interactions with normal matter.\n\nTo detect and study the interactions between dark matter and normal matter experimentally, scientists use several approaches:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei in sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Examples of such experiments include the DarkSide, XENON, and LUX experiments.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples of such experiments include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in the collisions of protons. These particles could then be detected through their interactions with normal matter in the detector. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC are actively searching for signs of dark matter production.\n\n4. Theoretical and numerical simulations: Scientists also use theoretical models and computer simulations to study the properties and interactions of dark matter with normal matter. These simulations help to make predictions that can be tested with observations and experiments.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for the existence of interaction between dark matter and normal matter comes from various astrophysical and cosmological observations. Detecting and studying these interactions experimentally is an ongoing effort, involving a combination of direct detection, indirect detection, collider experiments, and theoretical studies."
