    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength due to a circular loop of wire carrying a current:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (2 A), R is the radius of the circular loop (5 cm or 0.05 m), and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field strength (10 cm or 0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-7) T * 0.0025 / (2 * 0.0559)\n\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10^(-9) T / 0.1118\n\nB ≈ 1.41 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the wire is approximately 1.41 × 10^(-8) T (Tesla).\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the magnetic field. Since the wire is wrapped into a circular loop, the magnetic field lines will be concentric circles around the wire. We can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (clockwise in this case), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field at the point 10 cm from the wire will be tangent to the circle formed by the magnetic field lines, and it will be perpendicular to the radial line connecting the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field."
