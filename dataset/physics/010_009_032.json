    "message_1": "A cylinder with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm is filled with water. At the bottom of the cylinder, a small hole with a radius of 2 mm is opened. What is the speed of water coming out of the hole? (Assuming no friction and neglecting atmospheric pressure)",
    "message_2": "To find the speed of water coming out of the hole, we can use Torricelli's theorem, which states that the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice is related to the height of fluid above the orifice. The formula for Torricelli's theorem is:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * g * h)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the fluid above the orifice.\n\nIn this case, the height of the fluid (h) is equal to the height of the cylinder, which is 10 cm or 0.1 m. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 9.81 m/s² * 0.1 m)\nv = sqrt(1.962 m²/s²)\nv = 1.4 m/s\n\nSo, the speed of water coming out of the hole is approximately 1.4 m/s."
