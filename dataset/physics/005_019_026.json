    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the de Broglie wavelength of the relativistic electron and then calculate the phase difference between the electron and the photon at two points where the intensity is maximum.\n\n1. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the relativistic electron:\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength (λ) of a particle is given by the formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the momentum is given by:\n\np = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), v is the velocity of the electron (0.8c), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the momentum of the electron:\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\np = (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 2.4 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (2.4 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\np ≈ 1.534 x 10^-22 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can find the de Broglie wavelength of the electron:\n\nλ_electron = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (1.534 x 10^-22 kg m/s)\nλ_electron ≈ 4.32 x 10^-12 m\n\n2. Calculate the phase difference between the electron and the photon at two points where the intensity is maximum:\n\nThe phase difference (Δφ) between two waves is given by the formula:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (path difference) / λ\n\nAt the points where the intensity is maximum, the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength. Let's consider two consecutive points of maximum intensity, where the path difference is equal to the wavelength of the photon (λ_photon = 500 nm = 5 x 10^-7 m).\n\nNow, we can find the phase difference between the electron and the photon:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (5 x 10^-7 m) / (4.32 x 10^-12 m)\nΔφ ≈ 727,000 * 2π\n\nSince the phase difference is an angle, we can take its value modulo 2π:\n\nΔφ_mod = (727,000 * 2π) % (2π) ≈ 0\n\nThe phase difference between the electron and the photon at two consecutive points of maximum intensity is approximately 0 radians, which means they are in phase at these points."
