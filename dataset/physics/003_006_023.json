    "message_1": "A student needs to calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from a coil with 50 turns, a radius of 5 cm and a current of 2 A flowing through it. What is the magnetic field strength at this distance?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance from a coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength due to a solenoid, which is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the coil.\n\nHowever, this formula is applicable for a solenoid, which is a long coil. In this case, we have a single coil with a finite radius. To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance from a single coil, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The magnetic field strength at a point on the axis of the coil is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current flowing through the coil, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nN = 50 turns\nI = 2 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 50 * 2 * (0.05)^2) / (2 * ((0.05)^2 + (0.1)^2)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the coil is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
