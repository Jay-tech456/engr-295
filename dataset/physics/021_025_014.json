    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They are different from the black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars or black hole mergers. The formation of PBHs is typically associated with density fluctuations in the early universe, where regions of higher density could collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.\n\nThe likelihood of PBHs being formed as a result of black hole mergers is quite low, as PBHs are expected to have formed much earlier in the universe's history. Black hole mergers, on the other hand, involve the coalescence of two black holes that have formed from the collapse of massive stars or previous mergers. These events are typically associated with the late stages of stellar evolution and are not directly related to the formation of PBHs.\n\nAs for the expected distribution of masses of primordial black holes, it is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among physicists. The mass distribution of PBHs depends on the specifics of the inflationary model and the density fluctuations in the early universe. Some models predict a wide range of PBH masses, from as low as the Planck mass (around 10^-8 kg) to thousands of solar masses. Other models suggest a more narrow mass range, with PBHs having masses similar to those of stellar-mass black holes (a few to several tens of solar masses).\n\nIt is important to note that the existence of primordial black holes has not yet been confirmed observationally, and their properties, including their mass distribution, remain speculative. Future observations, such as those from gravitational wave detectors or other astrophysical probes, may provide more insight into the nature of primordial black holes and their role in the universe's evolution."
