    "message_2": "The expected rate of detection for LISA for gravitational waves emitted by binary white dwarf systems in our galaxy depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the instrument, the number of detectable sources, and the characteristics of the binary white dwarf systems.\n\nAccording to recent studies and simulations, LISA is expected to detect thousands of binary white dwarf systems in our galaxy. A study by Korol et al. (2017) estimates that LISA will detect around 25,000 binary white dwarf systems with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 7. Another study by Breivik et al. (2018) predicts that LISA will observe about 9,000 detached binary white dwarf systems and around 2,000 interacting systems.\n\nThese numbers are based on the current understanding of the population of binary white dwarf systems in our galaxy, as well as the expected sensitivity of LISA. However, it is important to note that these estimates are subject to change as our knowledge of the binary white dwarf population and LISA's capabilities improve.\n\nIn summary, based on the population of known binary white dwarf systems, LISA is expected to detect thousands of gravitational wave signals from these systems in our galaxy. The exact number will depend on the final sensitivity of the instrument and our understanding of the binary white dwarf population.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Korol, V., Rossi, E. M., & Groot, P. J.
