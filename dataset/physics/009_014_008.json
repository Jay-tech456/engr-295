    "message_2": "Longitudinal chromatic aberration is the difference in focal lengths for different colors of light. In this case, we are given the focal lengths for red and blue light.\n\nFocal length for red light (f_red) = 50 mm\nFocal length for blue light (f_blue) = 48 mm\n\nTo calculate the longitudinal chromatic aberration, we simply find the difference between the focal lengths:\n\nLongitudinal chromatic aberration = |f_red - f_blue|\n= |50 mm - 48 mm|\n= 2 mm\n\nSo, the longitudinal chromatic aberration for this 35 mm lens is 2 mm."
