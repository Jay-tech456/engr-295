    "message_1": "A airplane is flying at a constant altitude of 6000 meters with a speed of 200 km/hr. If the air density is 1.2 kg/m³, calculate the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces of the wings, given that the wings have a chord length of 2 meters and air flows over them with an average speed of 180 km/hr. Use Bernoulli’s principle to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Bernoulli's principle, which states that the sum of the pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume of a fluid remains constant along a streamline. In this case, we can ignore the potential energy term as the airplane is flying at a constant altitude.\n\nBernoulli's equation for the top and bottom surfaces of the wings can be written as:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * ρ * V1² = P2 + 0.5 * ρ * V2²\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the pressures on the top and bottom surfaces of the wings, ρ is the air density, and V1 and V2 are the velocities of the air over the top and bottom surfaces of the wings.\n\nWe are given the average speed of the air over the wings as 180 km/hr. Since the airplane is flying at a speed of 200 km/hr, we can assume that the airspeed over the top surface of the wing is slightly less than the average speed, and the airspeed over the bottom surface is slightly more than the average speed. Let's assume that the airspeed over the top surface is 170 km/hr and the airspeed over the bottom surface is 190 km/hr. We need to convert these speeds to meters per second:\n\nV1 = 170 km/hr * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 47.22 m/s\nV2 = 190 km/hr * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 52.78 m/s\n\nNow we can plug these values into Bernoulli's equation:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * ρ * V1² = P2 + 0.5 * ρ * V2²\n\nWe want to find the pressure difference (ΔP) between the top and bottom surfaces of the wings:\n\nΔP = P2 - P1\n\nSubstituting the Bernoulli's equation:\n\nΔP = 0.5 * ρ * (V2² - V1²)\n\nNow we can plug in the given values for air density (ρ = 1.2 kg/m³) and the calculated airspeeds:\n\nΔP = 0.5 * 1.2 kg/m³ * (52.78 m/s² - 47.22 m/s²)\nΔP = 0.6 kg/m³ * (2788.37 m²/s² - 2229.77 m²/s²)\nΔP = 0.6 kg/m³ * 558.6 m²/s²\nΔP = 335.16 Pa\n\nSo, the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces of the wings is approximately 335.16 Pa."
