    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the gravitational lensing observed around galaxies. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as another galaxy or a quasar. This bending of light is due to the gravitational pull of the massive object, which causes the spacetime around it to curve, following the predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect light. However, it does interact gravitationally, and its presence can be inferred through its effects on visible matter and light. Dark matter is believed to make up around 85% of the total matter in the universe, and it plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nWhen a galaxy contains significant amounts of dark matter, its total mass (including both visible and dark matter) is higher, leading to a stronger gravitational pull. This stronger gravity causes more pronounced gravitational lensing effects, such as larger deflections of light and more distorted images of background objects. In some cases, the lensing can even produce multiple images of the same background object, arranged in a characteristic pattern known as an \"Einstein ring.\"\n\nTo quantify the difference in lensing effects between a galaxy with and without significant amounts of dark matter, we can compare their mass distributions and the resulting deflection angles of light. The deflection angle (α) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the lensing object (in this case, the galaxy), c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter, which represents the distance of closest approach of the light to the center of mass of the lensing object.\n\nIn a galaxy with significant amounts of dark matter, the total mass M will be larger, leading to a larger deflection angle α. This means that the lensing effects will be more pronounced, and the images of background objects will be more distorted.\n\nTo determine the exact quantitative difference in lensing effects, one would need to know the mass distributions of the galaxies with and without dark matter, as well as the distances to the lensing galaxies and the background objects. With this information, one could calculate the deflection angles and compare the resulting lensing effects. In general, though, the presence of dark matter leads to stronger gravitational lensing, providing an important observational tool for studying the distribution and properties of this mysterious form of matter."
