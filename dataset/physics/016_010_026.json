    "message_2": "To determine the maximum current that can be transmitted through a superconducting cable without exceeding the critical temperature, we need to know the critical current density (Jc) of the superconducting material used in the cable. The critical current density is the maximum current density that a superconductor can carry without losing its superconducting properties.\n\nThe maximum current (Imax) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nImax = Jc × A\n\nwhere Jc is the critical current density (in A/m²) and A is the cross-sectional area of the cable (in m²).\n\nSince we are not given the critical current density of the superconducting material, we cannot provide a specific value for the maximum current. However, if you provide the critical current density, we can calculate the maximum current for the given cable dimensions."
