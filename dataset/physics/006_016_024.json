    "message_1": "A sample of lithium-6 atom has a nuclear spin of 1/2 and an external magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla is applied to it. Calculate the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation required to produce the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect in lithium-6.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation required to produce the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect in lithium-6, we need to use the following equation:\n\nν = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (which is specific to each nucleus), B is the external magnetic field, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFor lithium-6, the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is approximately 6.267 * 10^7 rad T^-1 s^-1.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nν = (6.267 * 10^7 rad T^-1 s^-1 * 1.5 T) / (2 * π)\n\nν ≈ (9.4005 * 10^7 rad s^-1) / (2 * π)\n\nν ≈ (9.4005 * 10^7 rad s^-1) / (6.28318)\n\nν ≈ 1.497 * 10^7 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation required to produce the NMR effect in lithium-6 is approximately 14.97 MHz.\n\nNow, to calculate the wavelength (λ) of the electromagnetic radiation, we can use the equation:\n\nλ = c / ν\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 * 10^8 m/s).\n\nλ = (3.0 * 10^8 m/s) / (1.497 * 10^7 Hz)\n\nλ ≈ 20.04 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation required to produce the NMR effect in lithium-6 is approximately 20.04 meters."
