    "message_2": "To calculate the change in the period of revolution of a binary star system due to the emission of gravitational waves, we can use the following formula derived from the general relativity:\n\nΔP/P = - (96π/5) * (G²/c⁵) * (M₁*M₂*(M₁+M₂) / a⁴) * Δt\n\nwhere:\nΔP is the change in the period of revolution\nP is the initial period of revolution\nG is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\nc is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\nM₁ and M₂ are the masses of the two stars in the binary system (in kg)\na is the semi-major axis of the binary system (in m)\nΔt is the time interval over which the change in period is measured (in s)\n\nGiven the masses of the two stars (M₁ and M₂), the semi-major axis (a), and the time interval (Δt), we can plug these values into the formula and calculate the change in the period of revolution (ΔP) of the binary system due to the emission of gravitational waves.\n\nNote that this formula assumes that the binary system is composed of two point masses in a circular orbit, and the change in the period is small compared to the initial period. For more complex systems or larger changes in the period, a more detailed analysis would be required."
