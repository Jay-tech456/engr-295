    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 4 centimeters away from the conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying conductor is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the conductor (5 A)\n- dl is the length of the conductor (2 m)\n- r is the distance from the conductor to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field (0.04 m)\n\nHowever, since the conductor is straight, we need to integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the conductor. The magnetic field at a distance r from a straight conductor of length L carrying a current I is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r) * (cos(θ₁) - cos(θ₂))\n\nwhere θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles between the line connecting the point to the ends of the conductor and the perpendicular line from the point to the conductor.\n\nIn our case, the conductor is 2 meters long, and the point is 4 centimeters (0.04 meters) away from the conductor. We can imagine a right triangle formed by the conductor, the perpendicular line from the point to the conductor, and the line connecting the point to one end of the conductor. The hypotenuse of this triangle is:\n\nh = √(r² + (L/2)²) = √(0.04² + (2/2)²) = √(0.04² + 1²) = √(0.0016 + 1) = √1.0016 ≈ 1.0008 m\n\nNow, we can find the angles θ₁ and θ₂:\n\ncos(θ₁) = r / h = 0.04 / 1.0008 ≈ 0.03998\ncos(θ₂) = -cos(θ₁) ≈ -0.03998\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m) * (0.03998 - (-0.03998))\nB = (2 × 10⁻⁶ T * 5) / 0.04 * 0.07996\nB = 10⁻⁵ T / 0.04 * 0.07996\nB ≈ 1.999 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 4 centimeters away from the conductor is approximately 1.999 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla)."
