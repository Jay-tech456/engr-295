    "message_2": "As a text-based AI, I cannot draw a ray diagram. However, I can help you understand the process and provide the necessary information to draw it yourself.\n\nGiven that the magnification (m) is -2.5 and the object distance (u) is 20 cm, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula to find the image distance (v) and the focal length (f) of the concave mirror.\n\nThe mirror formula is:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nThe magnification formula is:\nm = -v/u\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the magnification formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n-2.5 = -v/20\nv = 20 * 2.5\nv = 50 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the focal length (f) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/f = 1/20 + 1/50\n1/f = (5 + 2) / 100\n1/f = 7/100\nf = 100/7\nf â‰ˆ 14.29 cm\n\nNow that we have the focal length and image distance, you can draw the ray diagram as follows:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis.\n2. Draw a vertical line at the center to represent the mirror. Mark the center point as C.\n3. Mark the focal point F at a distance of 14.29 cm to the left of C.\n4. Place the object A at a distance of 20 cm to the left of C.\n5. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object A. This ray will reflect through the focal point F.\n6. Draw a ray from the top of the object A through the focal point F. This ray will reflect parallel to the principal axis.\n7. The intersection of the two reflected rays will give the position of the image A'. The image will be inverted and 2.5 times larger than the object.\n\nNow you have the position and size of the image formed by the concave mirror. The image is 50 cm to the left of the mirror, and it is inverted and magnified by a factor of 2.5."
