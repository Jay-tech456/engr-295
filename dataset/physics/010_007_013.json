    "message_2": "To calculate the buoyant force acting on the sphere, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. \n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can calculate the volume:\n\nV = (4/3)π(0.1)³\nV ≈ 0.00419 m³\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the sphere using its density:\n\nmass = density × volume\n\nGiven the density of the sphere is 8000 kg/m³, we can calculate the mass:\n\nmass = 8000 kg/m³ × 0.00419 m³\nmass ≈ 33.52 kg\n\nNext, we can find the weight of the sphere:\n\nweight = mass × acceleration due to gravity\n\nGiven the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s², we can calculate the weight:\n\nweight = 33.52 kg × 9.8 m/s²\nweight ≈ 328.296 N\n\nNow, we can find the buoyant force acting on the sphere using Archimedes' principle:\n\nbuoyant force = weight of the fluid displaced\n\nSince the sphere is submerged in water, the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere. The weight of the water displaced can be calculated using the volume of the sphere and the density of water:\n\nweight of water displaced = density of water × volume of sphere × acceleration due to gravity\n\nGiven the density of water is 1000 kg/m³, we can calculate the weight of the water displaced:\n\nweight of water displaced = 1000 kg/m³ × 0.00419 m³ × 9.8 m/s²\nweight of water displaced ≈ 41.062 N\n\nTherefore, the buoyant force acting on the sphere is approximately 41.062 N.\n\nNow, to find the depth to which the sphere is submerged in the water, we can use the equilibrium condition:\n\nbuoyant force = weight of the sphere\n\nSince the buoyant force is less than the weight of the sphere, the sphere will sink to the bottom of the water. The depth to which the sphere is submerged will be determined by the depth of the water, not by the buoyant force or the weight of the sphere."
