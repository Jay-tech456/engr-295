    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop of radius \"r\" carrying a current \"I\", we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying ring is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r²) / (2 * (r² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, r is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nAt the center of the loop, the distance x is 0. So, the formula becomes:\n\nB_center = (μ₀ * I * r²) / (2 * (r²)^(3/2))\n\nB_center = (μ₀ * I * r²) / (2 * r³)\n\nB_center = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * r)\n\nNow, let's analyze how the magnetic field varies as the distance from the center (x) increases. We can use the same formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r²) / (2 * (r² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nAs x increases, the denominator (r² + x²)^(3/2) will also increase. Since the numerator (μ₀ * I * r²) remains constant, the overall magnetic field B will decrease as x increases. This means that the magnetic field is strongest at the center of the loop and weakens as we move away from the center along the axis of the loop."
