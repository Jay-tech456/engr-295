    "message_2": "To calculate the specific absorption rate (SAR) of a human body exposed to a 10 GHz electromagnetic radiation field, we need to know the intensity of the electromagnetic field (in W/mÂ²) and the mass of the tissue being exposed. However, since the intensity is not provided, we can only discuss the potential biological impact of exposure to a 10 GHz electromagnetic radiation field.\n\nThe potential biological impact of exposure to a 10 GHz electromagnetic radiation field depends on the intensity of the field and the duration of exposure. In general, higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, such as 10 GHz, are absorbed more superficially in the body, primarily affecting the skin and eyes.\n\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has established guidelines for safe exposure limits to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. For frequencies between 2 and 300 GHz, the recommended maximum SAR for the general public is 0.08 W/kg for whole-body exposure and 2 W/kg for localized exposure (such as the head and trunk).\n\nIf the exposure to the 10 GHz electromagnetic radiation field is within these guidelines, the potential biological impact is expected to be minimal. However, if the exposure exceeds these limits, there may be potential risks, including tissue heating, which can lead to burns, cataracts, and other thermal-related injuries.\n\nIt is important to note that the long-term effects of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are still being researched, and more studies are needed to fully understand the potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure."
