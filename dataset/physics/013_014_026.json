    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the gravitational wave, we need to consider the properties of the black holes and the strain amplitude detected on Earth.\n\n1. Amplitude:\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational wave is directly related to the strain amplitude detected on Earth. The strain amplitude (h) is given as 10^-21. Since the amplitude of the gravitational wave (A) is proportional to the strain amplitude, we can write:\n\nA ∝ h\n\nHowever, without more information about the distance between the black holes and Earth, we cannot determine the exact amplitude of the gravitational wave.\n\n2. Frequency:\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational wave can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c) of the binary system, which is a combination of the masses of the two black holes (m1 and m2):\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nGiven the masses of the black holes as 30 and 40 times the mass of the sun (M_sun), we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_c = (30 * M_sun * 40 * M_sun)^(3/5) / (30 * M_sun + 40 * M_sun)^(1/5)\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational wave (f) is related to the chirp mass and the time before the merger (t):\n\nf = (c^3 / G * M_c)^(5/8) * t^(-3/8)\n\nHowever, without the time before the merger, we cannot determine the exact frequency of the gravitational wave.\n\n3. Wavelength:\n\nThe wavelength (λ) of the gravitational wave can be determined using the speed of light (c) and the frequency (f):\n\nλ = c / f\n\nSince we do not have the exact frequency, we cannot determine the exact wavelength of the gravitational wave.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the distance between the black holes and Earth, the time before the merger, and the exact frequency of the gravitational wave, we cannot determine the amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the gravitational wave emitted from the collision of the two black holes."
