    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current in the loop\nR is the radius of the loop\nx is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis\n\nGiven:\nI = 2 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * 0.0125^(3/2) m^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.60 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis 5 cm from the center of the loop is approximately 1.60 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
