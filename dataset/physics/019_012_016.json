    "message_2": "In the semiclassical approximation, we consider the path integral formulation of quantum field theory. The non-perturbative effects can be computed using the method of instantons, which are classical solutions to the Euclidean field equations that describe tunneling between different vacua.\n\nThe Euclidean action for the massless scalar field theory with potential V(φ) = λφ⁴ is given by:\n\nS_E[φ] = ∫d⁴x [1/2 (∂_μφ)(∂^μφ) + λφ⁴]\n\nTo find the instanton solution, we need to minimize the action. The equation of motion for the scalar field φ is obtained by varying the action with respect to φ:\n\nδS_E / δφ = -∂²φ + 4λφ³ = 0\n\nThis is a nonlinear differential equation, and finding an exact solution is difficult. However, we can make an ansatz (a trial solution) for the instanton solution. A common ansatz for the scalar field is:\n\nφ(x) = η f(ρ)\n\nwhere η is a constant with dimensions of mass, ρ = √(x² + y² + z² + τ²) is the radial coordinate in Euclidean space, and f(ρ) is a dimensionless function that we need to determine.\n\nSubstituting the ansatz into the equation of motion, we get:\n\n-η(∂²ρf(ρ) + 3/ρ ∂ρf(ρ)) + 4λη³f(ρ)³ = 0\n\nNow, we can make a change of variables: ξ = √(8λ)ηρ. The equation of motion becomes:\n\n-(1/4)∂²ξf(ξ) - (3/4ξ)∂ξf(ξ) + f(ξ)³ = 0\n\nThis is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it numerically or look for approximate solutions. One possible solution is the so-called \"kink\" solution:\n\nf(ξ) = ±√2 tanh(ξ/√2)\n\nThe instanton action can be computed by substituting the instanton solution back into the Euclidean action:\n\nS_E[φ] = 8π²/3λ\n\nThe non-perturbative effects in the scalar field theory can be computed using the semiclassical approximation, which involves the exponential of the instanton action:\n\ne^(-S_E[φ]) ∝ e^(-8π²/3λ)\n\nThis result shows that the non-perturbative effects are exponentially suppressed in the weak coupling limit (λ → 0). The method of instantons provides a way to compute these effects in the semiclassical approximation, which can be important for understanding the vacuum structure and tunneling phenomena in quantum field theories."
