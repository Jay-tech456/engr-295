    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the photon in the medium, we can use the formula:\n\nv = c / n\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the photon in the medium, c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nv = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.5\nv ≈ 2.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nThe velocity of the photon in the medium is approximately 2.0 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nTo find the energy of the photon, we can use the formula:\n\nE = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\n500 nm = 500 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow we can calculate the energy:\n\nE = (6.63 x 10^-34 Js)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (500 x 10^-9 m)\nE ≈ 3.98 x 10^-19 J\n\nThe energy of the photon is approximately 3.98 x 10^-19 joules."
