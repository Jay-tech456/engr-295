    "message_1": "A polarizer with transmission axis making an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the vertical plane is placed in front of an unpolarized light source. The polarizer is followed by an analyzer with the transmission axis horizontal. If the intensity of the source is 15 W/m², what is the intensity of the light passing through the analyzer? (Use Malus' Law to calculate the final answer.)",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through two polarizers is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the final intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and analyzer.\n\nIn this case, the initial intensity I₀ is 15 W/m², and the angle θ between the transmission axes of the polarizer and analyzer is 60 degrees. Since the light source is unpolarized, we need to first find the intensity after passing through the first polarizer. The intensity of unpolarized light after passing through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI₁ = I₀ / 2\n\nSo, the intensity after passing through the first polarizer is:\n\nI₁ = 15 W/m² / 2 = 7.5 W/m²\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the intensity of light passing through the analyzer:\n\nI = I₁ * cos²(θ)\nI = 7.5 W/m² * cos²(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 1/2, we have:\n\nI = 7.5 W/m² * (1/2)²\nI = 7.5 W/m² * 1/4\nI = 1.875 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light passing through the analyzer is 1.875 W/m²."
