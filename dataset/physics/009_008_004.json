    "message_2": "To determine the position, nature, and magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = 15 cm\nObject distance (u) = -25 cm (negative sign indicates the object is on the same side as the mirror's reflective surface)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-25) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(-25 - 15) / (15 * -25) = 1/v\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for v:\n\n-40 / (-375) = 1/v\n\nv = 375/40\nv = 9.375 cm\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive, the image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror, which means it is a real and inverted image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -9.375 / -25\nM = 0.375\n\nThe magnification is 0.375, which means the image is smaller than the object (since M < 1).\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is 9.375 cm away from the mirror's vertex on the opposite side, it is real, inverted, and smaller than the object with a magnification of 0.375."
