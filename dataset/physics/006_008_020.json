Given that ionization energy (work function) of hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV. Calculate the kinetic energy and stopping potential of the ejected electron if the frequency of the incident light is twice the required frequency.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum frequency of light required to eject an electron from a hydrogen atom in the ground state, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE = h * f_min\n\nwhere E is the ionization energy (work function), h is the Planck's constant, and f_min is the minimum frequency of light required.\n\nThe ionization energy of hydrogen is given as 13.6 eV. We need to convert this to Joules:\n\nE = 13.6 eV * (1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV) = 2.176 * 10^(-18) J\n\nPlanck's constant, h = 6.626 * 10^(-34) Js\n\nNow we can solve for the minimum frequency:\n\nf_min = E / h = (2.176 * 10^(-18) J) / (6.626 * 10^(-34) Js) = 3.28 * 10^15 Hz\n\nSo, the minimum frequency of light required to eject an electron from a hydrogen atom in the ground state is 3.28 * 10^15 Hz.\n\nNow, let's calculate the kinetic energy and stopping potential of the ejected electron if the frequency of the incident light is twice the required frequency.\n\nf = 2 * f_min = 2 * 3.28 * 10^15 Hz = 6.56 * 10^15 Hz\n\nWe can use the photoelectric effect equation again, but this time we need to find the kinetic energy (K.E.) of the ejected electron:\n\nE = h * f = K.E. + work function\n\nK.E. = h * f - work function = (6.626 * 10^(-34) Js) * (6.56 * 10^15 Hz) - 2.176 * 10^(-18) J\n\nK.E. = 4.352 * 10^(-18) J\n\nNow, let's find the stopping potential (V_s). The stopping potential is the potential difference required to stop the ejected electron. We can use the following equation:\n\nK.E. = e * V_s\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 * 10^(-19) C).\n\nV_s = K.E. / e = (4.352 * 10^(-18) J) / (1.6 * 10^(-19) C) = 27.2 V\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is 4.352 * 10^(-18) J, and the stopping potential is 27.2 V."
