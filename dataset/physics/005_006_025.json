    "message_2": "To calculate the difference in frequency due to gravitational redshift, we can use the formula:\n\nΔf = f₀ * (ΔU / c²)\n\nwhere Δf is the difference in frequency, f₀ is the initial frequency of the photon, ΔU is the difference in gravitational potential energy between the two points, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in gravitational potential energy (ΔU) between the surface of the Earth and the top of the Eiffel Tower. The formula for gravitational potential energy is:\n\nU = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object (in this case, the photon), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height above the reference point (the surface of the Earth).\n\nSince we are interested in the difference in potential energy (ΔU), we can write:\n\nΔU = m * g * (h₂ - h₁)\n\nwhere h₂ is the height at the top of the Eiffel Tower (324 meters) and h₁ is the height at the surface of the Earth (0 meters). Therefore:\n\nΔU = m * g * 324\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula for the difference in frequency:\n\nΔf = f₀ * (ΔU / c²)\n\nΔf = f₀ * (m * g * 324 / c²)\n\nHowever, we cannot calculate the exact difference in frequency without knowing the initial frequency (f₀) and the mass of the photon (m). The mass of a photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = E / c²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency by the formula:\n\nE = h * f₀\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant. Therefore, the mass of a photon can be written as:\n\nm = h * f₀ / c²\n\nSubstituting this expression for the mass of the photon into the formula for the difference in frequency, we get:\n\nΔf = f₀ * (h * f₀ / c² * g * 324 / c²)\n\nΔf = f₀² * h * g * 324 / c⁴\n\nThis formula shows that the difference in frequency depends on the initial frequency of the photon (f₀). However, the effect of gravitational redshift is extremely small, especially for a height difference of only 324 meters. In most practical situations, this difference in frequency would be negligible and difficult to measure."
