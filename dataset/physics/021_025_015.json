    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to extreme density fluctuations. The likelihood of their formation depends on the specific inflationary model and the properties of the early universe. However, it is generally considered to be a rare event.\n\nThe mass of a primordial black hole can range from very small (subatomic) to thousands of solar masses, depending on the size of the density fluctuations during the early universe. The mass distribution of PBHs is still a topic of active research, and there is no definitive answer yet.\n\nIn comparison, black holes formed from collapsing stars, known as stellar black holes, typically have masses between 3 and 20 solar masses. However, recent discoveries of black holes with masses up to 100 solar masses have challenged our understanding of stellar evolution and black hole formation.\n\nThe density of a black hole is not a well-defined concept, as the singularity at the center is considered to have infinite density. However, we can compare the average density within the event horizon (also known as the Schwarzschild radius) of black holes. The Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass of the black hole (R_s = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and c is the speed of light). Therefore, the average density within the event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the mass (œÅ ~ M^-2).\n\nThis means that smaller black holes, such as primordial black holes, would have a higher average density within their event horizons compared to larger stellar black holes. However, it is important to note that this comparison is only meaningful in a limited sense, as the internal structure of black holes is still not well understood due to the limitations of our current understanding of quantum gravity."
