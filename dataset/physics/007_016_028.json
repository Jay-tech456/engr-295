Compare the binding energy per nucleon of carbon-14 with that of helium-4 and suggest why helium-4 is more stable than carbon-14.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy per nucleon for carbon-14, we first need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons.\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately 1.00728 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.00867 amu.\n\nMass of 6 protons = 6 * 1.00728 amu = 6.04368 amu\nMass of 8 neutrons = 8 * 1.00867 amu = 8.06936 amu\nTotal mass of protons and neutrons = 6.04368 amu + 8.06936 amu = 14.11304 amu\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of protons and neutrons - Mass of nucleus\nMass defect = 14.11304 amu - 14.00324 amu = 0.1098 amu\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass defect to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s). We also need to convert amu to kg (1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg).\n\nMass defect in kg = 0.1098 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 1.8226 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can find the binding energy:\n\nBinding energy = (1.8226 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 1.6403 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nTo find the binding energy per nucleon, we divide the binding energy by the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons):\n\nBinding energy per nucleon for carbon-14 = (1.6403 x 10^-11 Joules) / 14 = 1.1716 x 10^-12 Joules/nucleon\n\nNow, let's compare this to the binding energy per nucleon for helium-4. The binding energy of helium-4 is approximately 28.3 MeV (1 MeV = 1.60218 x 10^-13 Joules). Helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so there are 4 nucleons in total.\n\nBinding energy per nucleon for helium-4 = (28.3 MeV) * (1.60218 x 10^-13 Joules/MeV) / 4 = 1.1272 x 10^-12 Joules/nucleon\n\nComparing the binding energy per nucleon for carbon-14 and helium-4:\n\nCarbon-14: 1.1716 x 10^-12 Joules/nucleon\nHelium-4: 1.1272 x 10^-12 Joules/nucleon\n\nHelium-4 has a lower binding energy per nucleon than carbon-14. This means that helium-4 is more stable than carbon-14 because it takes less energy to break apart helium-4 into its individual nucleons. In general, nuclei with lower binding energy per nucleon are more stable and less likely to undergo radioactive decay."
