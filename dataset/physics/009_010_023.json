    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the focal length (f) and the image distance (di).\n\nThe radius of curvature (R) is given as 20 cm. The relationship between the radius of curvature and the focal length is:\n\nf = R / 2\n\nPlugging in the value of R:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di). The mirror equation is:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. We are given the object distance (do) as 30 cm. Plugging in the values of f and do:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator, which is 30:\n\n3/30 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n3/30 - 1/30 = 1/di\n\n2/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find di by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance (di), we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nPlugging in the values of di and do:\n\nM = -15 cm / 30 cm\n\nM = -0.5\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is -0.5. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
