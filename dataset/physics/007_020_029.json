    "message_1": "A nuclear radiation detector has recorded a count rate of 2000 counts per minute for a sample of radioactive material. Suppose the average energy of each emitted photon is 1.2 MeV and the detector efficiency is 80%. Calculate the activity of the sample in Becquerels.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the activity of the sample in Becquerels, we first need to determine the actual count rate, taking into account the detector efficiency.\n\nThe detector efficiency is 80%, which means that it detects 80% of the emitted photons. Therefore, the actual count rate is higher than the recorded count rate. Let's denote the actual count rate as A.\n\nRecorded count rate = 0.8 * A\n\n2000 counts per minute = 0.8 * A\n\nTo find A, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\nA = 2000 counts per minute / 0.8\n\nA = 2500 counts per minute\n\nNow, we need to convert the count rate from counts per minute to counts per second (Becquerel is defined as one radioactive decay per second).\n\nA = 2500 counts per minute * (1 minute / 60 seconds)\n\nA = 2500 counts per minute * (1/60)\n\nA = 41.67 counts per second\n\nTherefore, the activity of the sample is approximately 41.67 Becquerels."
