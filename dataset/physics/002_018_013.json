    "message_2": "To find the Boyle temperature, we first need to determine the final pressure of the gas when the volume is decreased to 10 L while keeping the temperature constant. According to Boyle's Law, the product of the initial pressure and volume is equal to the product of the final pressure and volume when the temperature is constant:\n\nP1 * V1 = P2 * V2\n\nwhere P1 is the initial pressure, V1 is the initial volume, P2 is the final pressure, and V2 is the final volume. We are given:\n\nP1 = 2 atm\nV1 = 20 L\nV2 = 10 L\n\nWe can solve for P2:\n\nP2 = (P1 * V1) / V2\nP2 = (2 atm * 20 L) / 10 L\nP2 = 4 atm\n\nNow that we have the final pressure, we can find the Boyle temperature. The Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a gas obeys Boyle's Law exactly. For an ideal gas, this is true at all temperatures. Since we are given the molar volume at standard conditions (0°C or 273.15 K), we can assume the gas behaves ideally. Therefore, the Boyle temperature is the same as the constant temperature during the process:\n\nT_Boyle = T_constant\n\nSince the problem states that the temperature is constant throughout the process, we can use the Ideal Gas Law to find the temperature:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. We can use the initial conditions to find the temperature:\n\n2 atm * 20 L = n * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * T\n\nWe need to find the number of moles (n) in the gas. We can use the molar volume at standard conditions (24 L/mol) to find n:\n\nn = V1 / molar_volume\nn = 20 L / 24 L/mol\nn = 0.8333 mol\n\nNow we can plug n back into the Ideal Gas Law equation:\n\n2 atm * 20 L = 0.8333 mol * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * T\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = (2 atm * 20 L) / (0.8333 mol * 0.0821 L atm/mol K)\nT ≈ 293.15 K\n\nTherefore, the Boyle temperature of the gas is approximately 293.15 K."
