    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7, also known as YBCO, is approximately 92 Kelvin (-181°C or -294°F). This is the temperature below which the material exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and can carry electrical current without any energy loss.\n\nCompared to other high-temperature superconductors, YBCO has a relatively high critical temperature. For example, the critical temperature of another well-known high-temperature superconductor, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO), is around 85 K (-188°C or -306°F). However, there are some high-temperature superconductors with even higher critical temperatures, such as HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg-1223) with a Tc of around 133 K (-140°C or -220°F).\n\nIt is important to note that these critical temperatures are still significantly lower than room temperature, and cooling is required to achieve superconductivity in these materials. Nonetheless, high-temperature superconductors like YBCO have much higher critical temperatures than conventional superconductors, which typically have critical temperatures below 30 K (-243°C or -405°F). This makes high-temperature superconductors more practical for certain applications, as they can be cooled using liquid nitrogen (which has a boiling point of 77 K) instead of the more expensive and harder-to-handle liquid helium (which has a boiling point of 4.2 K) that is required for cooling conventional superconductors."
