    "message_2": "In the context of the Standard Model of particle physics and assuming lepton flavor is conserved, the probability of observing muon-to-electron conversion in a nucleus via the charged current interaction is effectively zero.\n\nThe reason for this is that lepton flavor conservation forbids such transitions. In the Standard Model, charged current interactions are mediated by W bosons, which couple to leptons and their corresponding neutrinos. Since the lepton flavor is conserved, a muon can only couple to a muon neutrino, and an electron can only couple to an electron neutrino. Therefore, a direct muon-to-electron conversion via charged current interaction is not allowed.\n\nHowever, if there were some new physics beyond the Standard Model that violates lepton flavor conservation, then such a process could be possible. Experiments searching for muon-to-electron conversion are actually conducted to probe for such new physics."
