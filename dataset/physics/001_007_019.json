    "message_2": "The ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E_0 is the ground state energy, hbar is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe angular frequency omega can be calculated using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (0.15 N/m) and m is the mass (0.02 kg).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the angular frequency:\n\nomega = sqrt(0.15 N/m / 0.02 kg) = sqrt(7.5 s^-2) ≈ 2.7386 s^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the ground state energy:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) * (2.7386 s^-1) ≈ 1.444 × 10^-34 J\n\nSo, the ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 1.444 × 10^-34 Joules."
