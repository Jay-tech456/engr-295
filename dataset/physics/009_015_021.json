    "message_1": "A student is designing a telescope with a concave mirror of focal length 30 cm and an aperture of 10 cm. How can the student minimize spherical aberration in the telescope and what is the maximum usable magnification for this telescope?",
    "message_2": "To minimize spherical aberration in the telescope, the student can do the following:\n\n1. Use a parabolic mirror instead of a spherical mirror: Parabolic mirrors focus all incoming parallel light rays to a single point, whereas spherical mirrors do not. This eliminates spherical aberration.\n\n2. Reduce the aperture size: A smaller aperture will reduce the amount of light entering the telescope, which can help minimize spherical aberration. However, this will also reduce the amount of light collected by the telescope, which may not be desirable.\n\n3. Use corrective lenses or mirrors: The student can add additional optical elements, such as lenses or mirrors, to correct for spherical aberration. These elements can be designed to counteract the aberration introduced by the primary mirror.\n\nNow, to calculate the maximum usable magnification for this telescope, we can use the following formula:\n\nMaximum usable magnification = 2 * Aperture (in inches)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the aperture from centimeters to inches:\n\n10 cm * (1 inch / 2.54 cm) ≈ 3.94 inches\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum usable magnification:\n\nMaximum usable magnification = 2 * 3.94 ≈ 7.88\n\nSo, the maximum usable magnification for this telescope is approximately 7.88 times."
