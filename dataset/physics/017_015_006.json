    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity of glasses at low temperatures is significantly influenced by the presence of disorder. In crystalline solids, the specific heat capacity follows the Debye model, which predicts that the specific heat capacity (C) is proportional to the cube of the temperature (T) at low temperatures (C ∝ T^3). However, in glasses, the presence of disorder leads to deviations from the Debye model.\n\nThe disorder in glasses can be attributed to their amorphous structure, which lacks the long-range order found in crystalline solids. This structural disorder leads to the presence of localized vibrational modes, also known as two-level systems (TLS). These TLS are associated with the tunneling of atoms or groups of atoms between two nearly equivalent energy states. At low temperatures, the specific heat capacity of glasses is dominated by the contributions from these TLS.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of glasses at low temperatures can be described by the following equation:\n\nC(T) = C_D(T) + C_TLS(T)\n\nwhere C_D(T) is the Debye contribution (C_D ∝ T^3) and C_TLS(T) is the contribution from the two-level systems. The TLS contribution is typically linear in temperature (C_TLS ∝ T).\n\nAs a result, the specific heat capacity of glasses at low temperatures deviates from the T^3 dependence predicted by the Debye model and exhibits a linear temperature dependence instead. This behavior is commonly known as the \"glassy anomaly\" in specific heat capacity and is a direct consequence of the presence of disorder in the amorphous structure of glasses."
