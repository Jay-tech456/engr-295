    "message_2": "According to the Special Relativity theory, the relativistic mass (m) of an object increases as its velocity (v) approaches the speed of light (c). The formula to calculate the relativistic mass is:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nIn this case, the spaceship's rest mass (m0) is 5000 kg, and it is traveling at 80% of the speed of light (v = 0.8c).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the fraction inside the square root:\n\nv^2 / c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the value inside the square root:\n\n1 - (v^2 / c^2) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNext, we find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic mass (m):\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)) = 5000 kg / 0.6 â‰ˆ 8333.33 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship while traveling at 80% of the speed of light is approximately 8333.33 kg."
