    "message_2": "The maximum dose of cosmic rays that the human body can withstand before experiencing radiation sickness depends on several factors, including the type and energy of the radiation, the duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility. In general, the unit used to measure the biological effect of ionizing radiation is the sievert (Sv).\n\nFor a short-term exposure, a dose of 1 Sv can cause radiation sickness, while a dose of 5 Sv or higher can be lethal. However, for long-term exposure, such as in space missions, the dose limits are much lower to minimize the risk of long-term health effects, such as cancer.\n\nNASA has established career dose limits for astronauts based on their age and sex to minimize the risk of exposure-induced death (REID) from cancer. These limits range from approximately 0.8 to 1.2 Sv for female astronauts and 1.2 to 1.6 Sv for male astronauts, depending on their age at the time of exposure.\n\nCosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originating from outside our solar system, pose a significant radiation risk for manned space missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as missions to the Moon or Mars. In LEO, the Earth's magnetic field provides some protection against cosmic rays, but this shielding effect decreases as spacecraft travel further from Earth.\n\nThe duration of manned space missions beyond LEO is limited by the cumulative radiation dose received by astronauts. For example, a round-trip mission to Mars, which could take around 2-3 years, would expose astronauts to a significant amount of cosmic radiation. Estimates suggest that the radiation dose for a Mars mission could be between 0.3 to 0.6 Sv, which is a considerable fraction of the career dose limits for astronauts.\n\nTo mitigate the radiation risk, several strategies can be employed, such as shielding spacecraft with materials that can absorb or deflect cosmic rays, using advanced propulsion systems to shorten the mission duration, and developing medical countermeasures to minimize the biological effects of radiation exposure. However, the radiation risk remains one of the major challenges for long-duration manned space missions beyond LEO."
