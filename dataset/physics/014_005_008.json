    "message_2": "The current understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe is that it is composed of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and even larger structures called superclusters, which are interconnected by vast cosmic filaments. This cosmic web is primarily shaped by the presence of dark matter and the influence of dark energy.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Evidence for dark matter comes from several observations:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: The observed rotation speeds of stars in galaxies do not match the predictions based on the visible mass of the galaxy. The presence of dark matter in a halo around the galaxy can explain these discrepancies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These observations reveal that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter.\n\nDark energy is a mysterious form of energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. It makes up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe. Evidence for dark energy comes from:\n\n1. Supernovae observations: By measuring the brightness and redshift of distant Type Ia supernovae, astronomers have discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which can be explained by the presence of dark energy.\n\n2. CMB radiation: The CMB also provides evidence for dark energy, as the observed distribution of temperature fluctuations is consistent with a universe dominated by dark energy.\n\n3. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the influence of dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures.\n\nDark matter and dark energy shape the distribution of matter in the universe in several ways:\n\n1. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It helps to hold these structures together and influences their overall distribution in the universe.\n\n2. Dark energy counteracts the gravitational pull of matter, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. This affects the growth of cosmic structures, as it limits the size of galaxy clusters and the overall density of matter in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the large-scale structure of the universe is shaped by the interplay between dark matter, which provides the gravitational framework for the formation of cosmic structures, and dark energy, which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. Evidence for the existence of these mysterious components comes from observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation."
