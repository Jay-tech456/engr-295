    "message_2": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNMR frequency = gyromagnetic ratio × magnetic field strength\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio for hydrogen is 42.58 MHz/T and the magnetic field strength is 2 T, we can calculate the NMR frequency as follows:\n\nNMR frequency = 42.58 MHz/T × 2 T\n\nNMR frequency = 85.16 MHz\n\nSo, the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 2 tesla is 85.16 MHz."
