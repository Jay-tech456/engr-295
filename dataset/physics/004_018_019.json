    "message_2": "To calculate the redshift observed in the photon emitted from the star's surface, we can use the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nz = (1 - 2GM/c^2R)^(-1/2) - 1\n\nwhere z is the redshift, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the center of the star to the detector.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the star is:\n\nM = 2 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the distance from the center of the star to the detector. The radius of the star is 10 km, and the detector is 20 km away from the star's surface, so the total distance is:\n\nR = 10 km + 20 km = 30 km = 30,000 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nz = (1 - 2(6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)(3.978 x 10^30 kg)/(2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2(30,000 m))^(-1/2) - 1\n\nz â‰ˆ 0.00044\n\nThe amount of redshift observed in the photon emitted from the star's surface and received by the detector placed 20 km away from the star's surface is approximately 0.00044."
