    "message_1": "What is the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a spinning black hole of a mass of 10 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, assuming its spin axis is aligned with the line of sight to Earth? How does the frequency and amplitude change if the black hole is instead located at a distance of 100 million light-years?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a spinning black hole, we need to consider the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. However, this formula is only valid for systems where the mass distribution is changing, such as binary systems or supernovae. A single spinning black hole does not emit gravitational waves because its mass distribution is not changing. \n\nHowever, if we consider a spinning black hole in a binary system, we can estimate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced. Let's assume the black hole is in a binary system with another black hole of equal mass (10 solar masses). The frequency of the gravitational waves is determined by the orbital frequency of the binary system.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves (f) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)^(1/2)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and a is the semi-major axis of the binary system. However, we don't have enough information to determine the semi-major axis (a) and thus cannot calculate the frequency.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M1 * M2 / (c^4 * r)) * (G * (M1 + M2) / (c^2 * a))^(-1/2)\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and r is the distance from the binary system to Earth. Again, we don't have enough information to determine the semi-major axis (a) and thus cannot calculate the amplitude.\n\nIf the black hole is instead located at a distance of 100 million light-years, the amplitude of the gravitational waves will be larger due to the inverse relationship between amplitude and distance (h ∝ 1/r). However, the frequency of the gravitational waves will remain the same, as it is determined by the orbital frequency of the binary system and is independent of the distance to Earth."
