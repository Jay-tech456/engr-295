    "message_2": "To find the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole, we can use the equation for the Schwarzschild radius (Rs):\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 10 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass into kilograms. The mass of one solar mass (Msun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\nM = 10 * Msun = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values of G, M, and c into the equation for the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nRs = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for this non-rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 29.5 kilometers."
