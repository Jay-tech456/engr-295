    "message_2": "A W' or Z' boson with a mass of 2 TeV would be a heavy gauge boson, which is a hypothetical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. These particles are expected to decay into various final states, depending on their couplings to other particles. The expected decay signatures in particle detectors for a W' or Z' boson with a mass of 2 TeV can be broadly classified into the following categories:\n\n1. Leptonic decays: The W' or Z' boson can decay into a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau) and a neutrino (for W') or a pair of charged leptons (for Z'). These decays would produce a high transverse momentum (pT) lepton(s) and missing transverse energy (MET) due to the undetected neutrino(s).\n\n2. Hadronic decays: The W' or Z' boson can decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which would subsequently hadronize and form jets. In this case, the decay signature would be two high-pT jets with a large invariant mass consistent with the 2 TeV mass of the W' or Z' boson.\n\n3. Decays into heavy particles: If the W' or Z' boson has significant couplings to heavy particles like top quarks or Higgs bosons, it could decay into these particles, which would then decay further into other particles. For example, a W' boson could decay into a top quark and a bottom quark, and the top quark could subsequently decay into a W boson and another bottom quark. This would result in a complex decay signature involving multiple jets, leptons, and MET.\n\nTo distinguish the W' or Z' boson decay signature from background noise and other signal processes, physicists employ various techniques:\n\n1. Event selection: By applying specific selection criteria on the final state particles (e.g., high-pT leptons, jets, and MET), physicists can enhance the signal-to-background ratio and suppress contributions from other processes.\n\n2. Invariant mass reconstruction: By reconstructing the invariant mass of the decay products, physicists can search for a resonance peak at the expected mass of the W' or Z' boson (2 TeV in this case). This peak would be a clear indication of the presence of a new heavy gauge boson.\n\n3. Advanced analysis techniques: Machine learning algorithms and multivariate analysis techniques can be used to further discriminate between signal and background events based on various kinematic and topological properties of the events.\n\n4. Statistical analysis: By performing a statistical analysis of the data, physicists can estimate the significance of any observed excess of events over the expected background and determine if it is consistent with the production and decay of a W' or Z' boson.\n\nIn summary, the expected decay signature of a 2 TeV W' or Z' boson in particle detectors would involve high-pT leptons, jets, and MET, depending on the decay mode. By employing various event selection, reconstruction, and analysis techniques, physicists can distinguish this signature from background noise and other signal processes."
