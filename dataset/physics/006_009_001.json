The scattering angle is 90 degrees. (Assume the mass of the electron is 9.11 x 10^-31 kg and the Planck's constant is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of an X-ray photon undergoing a Compton scattering event, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h / (m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s), m_e is the mass of the electron (9.11 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle (90 degrees).\n\nFirst, let's convert the scattering angle to radians:\n\nθ = 90 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 2 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s) / ((9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 - cos(π / 2))\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s) / (2.733 x 10^-22 kg·m/s) * (1 - 0)\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s) / (2.733 x 10^-22 kg·m/s)\n\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m\n\nSince the initial wavelength is given in nanometers, we can convert the change in wavelength to nanometers as well:\n\nΔλ ≈ 2.426 x 10^-12 m * (10^9 nm/m) ≈ 2.426 nm\n\nSo, the change in wavelength of the X-ray photon after the Compton scattering event is approximately 2.426 nm."
