    "message_2": "To find the frequency of an electromagnetic wave required to induce the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nf = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, B is the magnetic field strength, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio (γ) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nγ = μ / ħ\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.05457 x 10^(-34) Js).\n\nGiven the magnetic moment (μ) of 2.5 μN (2.5 x 10^(-6) Nm/T) and the magnetic field strength (B) of 1.5 T, we can first calculate the gyromagnetic ratio (γ):\n\nγ = (2.5 x 10^(-6) Nm/T) / (1.05457 x 10^(-34) Js)\nγ ≈ 2.3706 x 10^28 T^(-1)s^(-1)\n\nNow, we can use the Larmor equation to find the frequency (f):\n\nf = (2.3706 x 10^28 T^(-1)s^(-1) * 1.5 T) / (2 * π)\nf ≈ 5.649 x 10^28 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the electromagnetic wave required to induce the nuclear magnetic resonance effect in the given atom is approximately 5.649 x 10^28 Hz."
