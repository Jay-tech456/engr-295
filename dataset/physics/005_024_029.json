    "message_2": "To estimate the age of the universe according to the theory of relativistic cosmology, we can use the Hubble constant (H0), which describes the expansion rate of the universe. The Hubble constant is usually expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc). The current best estimate of the Hubble constant is around 67.4 km/s/Mpc, as determined by the Planck satellite.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is related to the expansion of the universe, and its current value is around 2.73 Kelvin, as you mentioned. However, to estimate the age of the universe, we need to convert the Hubble constant to a more convenient unit, such as Hubble time (tH).\n\ntH = 1 / H0\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Hubble constant from km/s/Mpc to s/Mpc:\n\n1 Mpc = 3.086 × 10^19 km\n\nH0 = 67.4 km/s/Mpc * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 km) = 2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow we can calculate the Hubble time:\n\ntH = 1 / H0 = 1 / (2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1) = 4.58 × 10^17 s\n\nTo convert this to years, we can use the following conversion:\n\n1 year ≈ 3.154 × 10^7 s\n\ntH ≈ 4.58 × 10^17 s * (1 year / 3.154 × 10^7 s) ≈ 14.5 billion years\n\nSo, according to the theory of relativistic cosmology and the current best estimate of the Hubble constant, the age of the universe is approximately 14.5 billion years. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and subject to change as more accurate measurements and refinements in our understanding of cosmology are made."
