    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial particle is at rest, the total momentum before and after the decay must be zero. Let's denote the energy of the two particles after the decay as E1 and E2, and their momenta as p1 and p2, respectively.\n\nConservation of energy:\nE_initial = E1 + E2\n\nSince the initial particle is at rest, its energy is equal to its rest mass:\nE_initial = 2 GeV\n\nConservation of momentum:\np_initial = p1 + p2\n\nSince the initial particle is at rest, its momentum is zero:\n0 = p1 + p2\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum relation for each particle after the decay:\nE1^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 + (p1*c)^2\nE2^2 = (m2*c^2)^2 + (p2*c)^2\n\nSubstituting the given rest masses:\nE1^2 = (0.5 GeV)^2 + (p1*c)^2\nE2^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (p2*c)^2\n\nSince p1 = -p2, we can rewrite the energy-momentum relation for E2 as:\nE2^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (-p1*c)^2\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (E1 and p1):\n1) E1 + E2 = 2 GeV\n2) E1^2 = (0.5 GeV)^2 + (p1*c)^2\n3) E2^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (-p1*c)^2\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the energy of each particle after the decay.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express E2 in terms of E1:\nE2 = 2 GeV - E1\n\nNow substitute this expression for E2 into equation 3:\n(2 GeV - E1)^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (-p1*c)^2\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n4 GeV^2 - 4 GeV * E1 + E1^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (-p1*c)^2\n\nNow substitute equation 2 into the equation above:\n4 GeV^2 - 4 GeV * E1 + (0.5 GeV)^2 + (p1*c)^2 = (1.5 GeV)^2 + (-p1*c)^2\n\nSimplifying and solving for E1:\nE1 = (4 GeV^2 - (0.5 GeV)^2 - (1.5 GeV)^2) / 4 GeV\nE1 ≈ 0.6875 GeV\n\nNow we can find E2 using equation 1:\nE2 = 2 GeV - E1\nE2 ≈ 2 GeV - 0.6875 GeV\nE2 ≈ 1.3125 GeV\n\nSo, the energy of each particle after the decay is approximately:\nE1 ≈ 0.6875 GeV\nE2 ≈ 1.3125 GeV"
