    "message_1": "What is the intensity transmitted through a polarizer when unpolarized light with an intensity of 4.0 W/m² is incident on it at an angle of 30°? The polarizer is oriented so that its transmission axis makes an angle of 60° with the direction of polarization of the incident light. The polarizer has a transmission axis that only allows 40% of incident light to pass. How much of the incident light is transmitted by the polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity transmitted through the polarizer, we first need to determine the intensity of the light after passing through the first polarizer. For unpolarized light, the intensity after passing through a polarizer is half of the incident intensity. \n\nI_after_first_polarizer = 0.5 * I_incident = 0.5 * 4.0 W/m² = 2.0 W/m²\n\nNext, we need to consider the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light, which is 60°. We can use Malus's law to find the intensity of light transmitted through the polarizer:\n\nI_transmitted = I_after_first_polarizer * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the transmission axis and the direction of polarization.\n\nI_transmitted = 2.0 W/m² * cos²(60°) = 2.0 W/m² * (1/2) = 1.0 W/m²\n\nFinally, we need to account for the fact that the polarizer only allows 40% of the incident light to pass:\n\nI_final = I_transmitted * 0.4 = 1.0 W/m² * 0.4 = 0.4 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light transmitted by the polarizer is 0.4 W/m²."
