    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron in a hydrogen atom tunneling through a potential barrier, we can use the formula for the transmission probability of a particle through a rectangular barrier. This formula is derived from the Schrödinger equation and is given by:\n\nT = (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k₂ * a)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))^(-1)\n\nwhere:\nT is the transmission probability (probability of tunneling),\nV₀ is the height of the potential barrier,\na is the width of the potential barrier,\nE is the energy of the electron,\nk₂ = sqrt(2 * m * (V₀ - E) / ħ^2), and\nm is the mass of the electron,\nħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to know the specific values for the barrier height (V₀), width (a), and energy of the electron (E). Once we have these values, we can plug them into the formula and calculate the transmission probability T, which represents the probability of the electron tunneling through the potential barrier to escape the atom."
