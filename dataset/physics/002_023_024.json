    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 40°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we first need to understand the equation itself. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following information:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol (converting to J/mol)\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K (converting to Kelvin)\nP1 = 1 atm\nT2 = 40°C = 313.15 K (converting to Kelvin)\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 40°C. We also need the value of the ideal gas constant R in appropriate units. Since we are working with J/mol and K, we will use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).\n\nNow, we can plug the given values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/1 atm) = -(40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol·K))(1/313.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2) = -4.889\nP2 = e^(-4.889)\nP2 ≈ 0.0075 atm\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 40°C is approximately 0.0075 atm."
