    "message_1": "What is the estimated energy released by a typical supernova explosion and how does it vary with the mass of the parent star?",
    "message_2": "A typical supernova explosion releases an enormous amount of energy, approximately 10^44 joules (1 foe, or one \"unit\" of supernova energy). This energy is released in the form of light, neutrinos, and kinetic energy of the ejected material. The energy released in a supernova explosion can vary depending on the type of supernova and the mass of the parent star.\n\nThere are two main types of supernovae: Type I and Type II. Type I supernovae occur in binary star systems, where a white dwarf accretes mass from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass (the Chandrasekhar limit, about 1.4 solar masses) and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion. The energy released in this type of supernova is relatively constant, as it is determined by the critical mass of the white dwarf.\n\nType II supernovae occur when massive stars (greater than 8 solar masses) exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo core collapse. The energy released in this type of supernova depends on the mass of the parent star and the details of the core collapse process. In general, more massive stars will release more energy in a supernova explosion, as they have more gravitational potential energy to be converted into kinetic energy and radiation.\n\nHowever, the relationship between the mass of the parent star and the energy released in a supernova explosion is not a simple linear one. The mass of the star, its metallicity, and the details of its evolution can all affect the energy released in a supernova explosion. Additionally, some very massive stars may undergo a different type of explosion called a pair-instability supernova, which can release even more energy than a typical core-collapse supernova.\n\nIn summary, the energy released by a typical supernova explosion is on the order of 10^44 joules, and it can vary depending on the mass of the parent star and the type of supernova. More massive stars generally release more energy in a supernova explosion, but the relationship is complex and depends on various factors."
