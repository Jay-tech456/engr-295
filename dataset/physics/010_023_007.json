    "message_2": "To calculate the Rossby number (Ro) for the ocean current, we need to know the velocity (U) of the current, the radius of deformation (L), and the Coriolis parameter (f) at the latitude where the current is located. The Rossby number is defined as:\n\nRo = U / (f * L)\n\nThe critical value for instability is typically around Ro = 1. When the Rossby number is greater than 1, it indicates that the inertial forces are dominant, and the flow is more likely to be unstable. When the Rossby number is less than 1, it suggests that the Coriolis forces are dominant, and the flow is more likely to be stable.\n\nTo compare the Rossby number to the critical value for instability, we need to calculate the Rossby number using the given velocity and radius of deformation, as well as the Coriolis parameter for the specific latitude.\n\nThe Coriolis parameter (f) can be calculated using the Earth's angular velocity (ω) and the latitude (φ) as follows:\n\nf = 2 * ω * sin(φ)\n\nThe Earth's angular velocity is approximately ω = 7.2921 × 10^(-5) rad/s. The latitude should be provided or can be estimated based on the location of the ocean current in the North Atlantic.\n\nOnce you have calculated the Rossby number, compare it to the critical value of 1 to determine if the ocean current is more likely to be stable or unstable."
