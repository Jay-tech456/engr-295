    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance from a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, for a straight wire, we can use Ampere's law, which simplifies the calculation. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nGiven the current I = 3 A and the distance r = 4 cm = 0.04 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T·m/A) / (0.08 m)\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.08\nB = 1.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is 1.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
