    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) divided by the length of the loop (2πr), where r is the radius of the loop.\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2 A and the radius (r) is 8 cm (0.08 m), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.08 m)\n\nThe current (A) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm * 2) / (2π * 0.08 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.16π m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.16\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB ≈ (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.16 ≈ 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 5 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
