    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the collision of two neutron stars, we can use the following formulas derived from General Relativity:\n\n1. Frequency (f): The frequency of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of the collision can be approximated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/8π) * (1/t)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2), and t is the time until coalescence.\n\n2. Amplitude (h): The amplitude of gravitational waves can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-2)) / r * (π * f * G * M_chirp * c^(-3))^(-2/3)\n\nwhere M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system, and r is the distance to the source.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the chirp mass (M_chirp) of the binary system:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars. Given that both neutron stars have a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg), we have:\n\nM1 = M2 = 1.4 * M_sun = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (2.7846 x 10^30 kg * 2.7846 x 10^30 kg)^(3/5) / (2.7846 x 10^30 kg + 2.7846 x 10^30 kg)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 2.436 x 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance to the source (130 million light-years) to meters:\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n130 million light-years = 130 x 10^6 * 9.461 x 10^15 m ≈ 1.23 x 10^25 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (f) and amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves:\n\n1. Frequency (f):\n\nTo calculate the frequency, we need to know the time until coalescence (t). Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem statement. However, we can provide the formula to calculate the frequency if the time until coalescence is known:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/8π) * (1/t)\n\n2. Amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-2)) / r * (π * f * G * M_chirp * c^(-3))^(-2/3)\nh = (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 * 2.436 x 10^30 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^(-2)) / (1.23 x 10^25 m) * (π * f * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 * 2.436 x 10^30 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^(-3))^(-2/3)\n\nThe amplitude (h) depends on the frequency (f), which in turn depends on the time until coalescence (t). If the time until coalescence is known, the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the provided formulas."
