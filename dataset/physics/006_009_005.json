    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of an X-ray photon that undergoes Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\nΔλ is the change in wavelength\nλ is the initial wavelength\nλ' is the final wavelength\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nθ is the scattering angle\n\nHowever, we don't have the scattering angle (θ) provided in the problem. Therefore, we can't calculate the exact change in wavelength without this information.\n\nIf you provide the scattering angle, we can then calculate the change in wavelength for the X-ray photon undergoing Compton scattering in hydrogen gas."
