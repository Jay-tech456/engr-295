How does it compare with the experimental upper limits set by the LHCb and Belle II collaborations?",
    "message_2": "In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, lepton flavor violation (LFV) processes are highly suppressed. The process B -> K*l*l, where l represents a lepton (electron or muon), is a rare decay process that can be used to test the SM and search for new physics. The expected branching ratio for this process within the SM is approximately (4.0 - 5.0) x 10^-7 for the electron channel (B -> K*ee) and (1.0 - 1.1) x 10^-6 for the muon channel (B -> K*μμ).\n\nThe LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) and Belle II experiments have set experimental upper limits on the branching ratios for these processes. The LHCb collaboration has reported an upper limit of 1.2 x 10^-8 at 95% confidence level (CL) for the electron channel and 2.6 x 10^-9 at 95% CL for the muon channel. The Belle II collaboration has set an upper limit of 7.7 x 10^-8 at 90% CL for the electron channel and 2.1 x 10^-7 at 90% CL for the muon channel.\n\nThese experimental upper limits are more stringent than the SM predictions, indicating that the observed branching ratios are consistent with the SM expectations. However, it is important to note that these measurements have uncertainties, and future improvements in experimental precision and theoretical calculations may lead to a better understanding of the LFV processes and potential deviations from the SM predictions."
