    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between a hot temperature source of 400 K and a cold temperature source of 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperature reservoirs. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. Both temperatures must be in Kelvin.\n\nIn this case, T_hot = 400 K and T_cold = 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 400 K) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine is 0.25 or 25%."
