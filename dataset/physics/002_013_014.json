    "message_1": "An ideal heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures 400 K and 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency that any heat engine can achieve when operating between two reservoirs at temperatures T1 (hot reservoir) and T2 (cold reservoir). It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T2 / T1)\n\nIn this case, T1 = 400 K (hot reservoir) and T2 = 300 K (cold reservoir). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 400 K)\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - 0.75\n\nCarnot efficiency = 0.25\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the ideal heat engine operating between the two reservoirs at temperatures 400 K and 300 K is 25%."
