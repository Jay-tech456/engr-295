Calculate the boiling point of the substance at 80kPa using Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the initial boiling point T1 = 85°C (convert to Kelvin: T1 = 85 + 273.15 = 358.15 K) and the initial pressure P1 = 101.3 kPa. We are also given the final pressure P2 = 80 kPa. We need to find the final boiling point T2.\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization, ΔHvap, is not given in the problem. However, we can estimate it using the Trouton's rule, which states that ΔHvap ≈ 85 J/mol·K for many substances. This is an approximation, and the actual value may be different for the specific substance in question. The ideal gas constant, R, is 8.314 J/mol·K.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(80/101.3) = -(85/8.314)(1/T2 - 1/358.15)\n\nSolving for T2:\n\n1/T2 - 1/358.15 = (8.314/85) ln(80/101.3)\n1/T2 = 1/358.15 + (8.314/85) ln(80/101.3)\nT2 = 1 / (1/358.15 + (8.314/85) ln(80/101.3))\n\nT2 ≈ 345.87 K\n\nNow convert the temperature back to Celsius:\n\nT2 = 345.87 - 273.15 = 72.72°C\n\nSo, the boiling point of the substance at 80 kPa is approximately 72.72°C."
