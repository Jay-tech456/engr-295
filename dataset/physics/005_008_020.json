Calculate the time dilation factor experienced by the astronaut on the ship according to the Lorentz transformation.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor, we first need to find the Lorentz factor (γ). The Lorentz factor is given by the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship and c is the speed of light. In this case, v = 0.9c, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ = 1 / 0.43589\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can use it to find the time dilation factor. Time dilation is given by the equation:\n\nΔt' = γ * Δt\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut on the ship and Δt is the time experienced by an observer on Earth. Since we want to find the time dilation factor, we can set Δt = 1:\n\nΔt' = 2.294 * 1\nΔt' ≈ 2.294\n\nSo the time dilation factor experienced by the astronaut on the ship is approximately 2.294. This means that for every second that passes on Earth, only about 1/2.294 ≈ 0.436 seconds pass for the astronaut on the spaceship."
