    "message_1": "A particle with a charge of 5 μC and a mass of 5 mg is moving with a velocity of 0.9c in the x direction. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric and magnetic fields as observed by an observer in a stationary frame of reference.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the electric and magnetic fields observed by a stationary observer, we need to use the Lorentz transformation for electric and magnetic fields. The Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nE'_x = E_x\nE'_y = γ(E_y + vB_z)\nE'_z = γ(E_z - vB_y)\n\nB'_x = B_x\nB'_y = γ(B_y - vE_z/c^2)\nB'_z = γ(B_z + vE_y/c^2)\n\nwhere E and B are the electric and magnetic fields in the moving frame, E' and B' are the electric and magnetic fields in the stationary frame, v is the velocity of the moving frame, c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nIn the moving frame of the particle, there is only an electric field due to the charge of the particle. We can calculate this electric field using Coulomb's law:\n\nE = kQ / r^2\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge of the particle (5 μC), and r is the distance from the particle. Since we are interested in the electric field as observed by the stationary observer, we can leave r as a variable.\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the electric and magnetic fields in the stationary frame. Since there is no magnetic field in the moving frame (B_x = B_y = B_z = 0), the transformation equations simplify to:\n\nE'_x = E_x\nE'_y = γE_y\nE'_z = γE_z\n\nB'_x = 0\nB'_y = -γvE_z/c^2\nB'_z = γvE_y/c^2\n\nThe Lorentz factor γ for v = 0.9c is:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9)^2) ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for E_x, E_y, and E_z from Coulomb's law:\n\nE_x = 0 (since the particle is moving in the x direction)\nE_y = kQ / r^2 (in the y direction)\nE_z = kQ / r^2 (in the z direction)\n\nUsing the transformation equations, we get:\n\nE'_x = 0\nE'_y = 2.294(kQ / r^2)\nE'_z = 2.294(kQ / r^2)\n\nB'_x = 0\nB'_y = -2.294(0.9c)(kQ / r^2) / c^2\nB'_z = 2.294(0.9c)(kQ / r^2) / c^2\n\nSo, the electric field in the stationary frame is:\n\nE' = (0, 2.294kQ / r^2, 2.294kQ / r^2)\n\nand the magnetic field in the stationary frame is:\n\nB' = (0, -2.294(0.9c)(kQ / r^2) / c^2, 2.294(0.9c)(kQ / r^2) / c^2)\n\nThe magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields depend on the distance r from the particle. The direction of the electric field is along the y and z axes, and the direction of the magnetic field is opposite in the y direction and along the z direction."
