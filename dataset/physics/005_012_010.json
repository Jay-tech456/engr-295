    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of an electron, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the velocity of the electron is 0.8c, we can substitute this into the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1) * (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667 * (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) * (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ (6.067 × 10^-31) * (9 × 10^16)\nK.E. ≈ 5.4603 × 10^-14 J\n\nTherefore, the relativistic kinetic energy of the electron is approximately 5.4603 × 10^-14 Joules."
