The distance between the planet and the astronaut is large enough to neglect gravitational time dilation effects. Assume that the wavelength of the emitted light is known.",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage change in the frequency of light emitted by a source on the surface of a planet with a mass twice as large as Earth, compared to a source on the Earth's surface, we need to consider the gravitational redshift effect.\n\nThe gravitational redshift formula is given by:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * (1 - (2 * GM / (R * c^2)))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_emitted is the emitted frequency, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, R is the radius of the planet, and c is the speed of light.\n\nLet's first calculate the observed frequency for Earth:\n\nf_observed_earth = f_emitted * (1 - (2 * G * M_earth / (R_earth * c^2)))\n\nNow, let's calculate the observed frequency for the planet with twice the mass of Earth. Assuming the planet has the same density as Earth, the radius of the planet would be larger by a factor of (2^(1/3)):\n\nM_planet = 2 * M_earth\nR_planet = R_earth * (2^(1/3))\n\nf_observed_planet = f_emitted * (1 - (2 * G * M_planet / (R_planet * c^2)))\n\nNow, we can find the percentage change in the frequency:\n\npercentage_change = ((f_observed_planet - f_observed_earth) / f_observed_earth) * 100\n\nBy substituting the values for G, M_earth, R_earth, and c, we can calculate the percentage change in the frequency of light emitted by a source on the surface of a planet with a mass twice as large as Earth, compared to a source on the Earth's surface, when observed by an astronaut in space."
