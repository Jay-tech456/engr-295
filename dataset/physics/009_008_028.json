    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and u = -30 cm (the negative sign indicates that the object is on the left side of the lens).\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n1/20 = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nNow, let's solve for v:\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/30\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 60\n1/v = 5/60\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe positive value of v indicates that the image is formed on the right side of the lens.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging the values:\nm = -12 / (-30)\nm = 12/30\nm = 2/5\n\nThe magnification is 2/5, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nSince the magnification is positive, the image is upright (same orientation as the object).\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the lens is 12 cm to the right of the lens, smaller in size (2/5 times the object size), and upright."
