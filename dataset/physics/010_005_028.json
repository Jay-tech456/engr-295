    "message_2": "To determine the drag force acting on the ball, we need to calculate the drag coefficient (Cd) for a turbulent flow and then use the drag force equation. For a sphere in turbulent flow, the drag coefficient can be approximated as Cd = 0.47.\n\nThe drag force equation is given by:\n\nF_d = 0.5 * ρ * v² * A * Cd\n\nwhere F_d is the drag force, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the ball, A is the cross-sectional area of the ball, and Cd is the drag coefficient.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given density of the ball from g/cm³ to kg/m³:\n\n0.25 g/cm³ * (1000 kg/m³ / 1 g/cm³) = 250 kg/m³\n\nHowever, we need the fluid density, not the ball's density. Since the fluid density is not given, we will assume it to be water at room temperature, which has a density of approximately 1000 kg/m³.\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross-sectional area of the ball:\n\nA = π * r²\nA = π * (0.07 m)²\nA ≈ 0.0154 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force:\n\nF_d = 0.5 * 1000 kg/m³ * (20 m/s)² * 0.0154 m² * 0.47\nF_d ≈ 282.28 N\n\nTherefore, the drag force acting on the ball is approximately 282.28 N."
