    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.4 m from the leading edge of the plate, we can use the Blasius solution for a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^0.5\n\nwhere:\nx = distance from the leading edge (0.4 m)\nν = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m^2/s)\nU = free stream velocity (10 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν). We are given the dynamic viscosity (μ) and can find the kinematic viscosity using the formula:\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nwhere:\nμ = dynamic viscosity (0.01 Pa·s)\nρ = fluid density (kg/m^3)\n\nHowever, we are not given the fluid density. Assuming the fluid is water at room temperature, the density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m^3. Therefore, the kinematic viscosity is:\n\nν = 0.01 Pa·s / 1000 kg/m^3 = 1 x 10^-5 m^2/s\n\nNow, we can find the boundary layer thickness (δ) at a distance of 0.4 m from the leading edge:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.4 m * (1 x 10^-5 m^2/s / 10 m/s))^0.5\nδ = (5 * 0.4 m * (1 x 10^-6))^0.5\nδ ≈ (2 x 10^-6)^0.5\nδ ≈ 1.41 x 10^-3 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.4 m from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 1.41 x 10^-3 meters or 1.41 mm."
