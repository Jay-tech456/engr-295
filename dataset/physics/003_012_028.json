    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the z-axis located at a distance of 20 cm from the origin, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rectangular loop lies in the xy plane and carries a current of 2 A in the counterclockwise direction, we can break the loop into four segments:\n\n1. Bottom segment: from (0, 0, 0) to (10, 0, 0)\n2. Right segment: from (10, 0, 0) to (10, 15, 0)\n3. Top segment: from (10, 15, 0) to (0, 15, 0)\n4. Left segment: from (0, 15, 0) to (0, 0, 0)\n\nWe will find the magnetic field contribution from each segment and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the point (0, 0, 20).\n\nLet's consider the bottom segment first. For this segment, dl = dx * x-hat, and r = x * x-hat + 20 * z-hat. The cross product dl x r = (dx * x-hat) x (x * x-hat + 20 * z-hat) = -20 * dx * y-hat. The magnitude of r is |r| = sqrt(x^2 + 20^2). Therefore, the magnetic field contribution from the bottom segment is:\n\ndB_bottom = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (-20 * dx * y-hat)) / (x^2 + 20^2)^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating this expression over x from 0 to 10, we get:\n\nB_bottom = (μ₀ / 4π) * (-40 * y-hat) * ∫(dx / (x^2 + 20^2)^(3/2)) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, let's consider the top segment. For this segment, dl = -dx * x-hat, and r = (x - 10) * x-hat + 15 * y-hat + 20 * z-hat. The cross product dl x r = (-dx * x-hat) x ((x - 10) * x-hat + 15 * y-hat + 20 * z-hat) = 20 * dx * y-hat. The magnitude of r is |r| = sqrt((x - 10)^2 + 15^2 + 20^2). Therefore, the magnetic field contribution from the top segment is:\n\ndB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (20 * dx * y-hat)) / ((x - 10)^2 + 15^2 + 20^2)^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating this expression over x from 0 to 10, we get:\n\nB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (40 * y-hat) * ∫(dx / ((x - 10)^2 + 15^2 + 20^2)^(3/2)) from 0 to 10\n\nSince the magnetic field contributions from the left and right segments are symmetric and in opposite directions, they will cancel each other out. Therefore, the total magnetic field at the point (0, 0, 20) is the sum of the magnetic fields due to the bottom and top segments:\n\nB_total = B_bottom + B_top\n\nTo find the numerical value of the magnetic field, we can use a numerical integration method, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, to evaluate the integrals."
