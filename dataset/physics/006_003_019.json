    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field needed to split the atomic spectral lines of a hydrogen atom into three components, we need to consider the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j * g_j\n\nwhere μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength, m_j is the magnetic quantum number, and g_j is the g-factor (which is 1 for hydrogen).\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the magnetic quantum number m_j can take values -1, 0, and 1, which correspond to the three components of the split spectral lines. To find the magnetic field strength needed to split the lines, we can use the Balmer series formula for hydrogen:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1), n1 is the principal quantum number of the lower energy level, and n2 is the principal quantum number of the higher energy level.\n\nFor the Balmer series, n1 = 2, and we can consider the transition from n2 = 3 to n1 = 2 (H-alpha line). Plugging these values into the Balmer series formula, we get:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/2^2 - 1/3^2) = 1.097 x 10^7 * (1/4 - 1/9) = 1.523 x 10^6 m^-1\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength λ:\n\nλ = 1 / (1.523 x 10^6) = 6.563 x 10^-7 m\n\nNext, we need to find the energy difference between the split lines:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ - h * c / (λ + Δλ)\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and Δλ is the change in wavelength due to the Zeeman effect.\n\nUsing the Zeeman effect energy shift formula, we can write:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j * g_j\n\nSince we are considering the transition from m_j = -1 to m_j = 1, the total energy shift is:\n\nΔE_total = μ_B * B * (1 - (-1)) * g_j = 2 * μ_B * B\n\nNow, we can equate the energy difference expressions and solve for B:\n\n2 * μ_B * B = h * c / λ - h * c / (λ + Δλ)\n\nB = (h * c / (2 * μ_B)) * (1/λ - 1/(λ + Δλ))\n\nFor a magnetic field strength of 0.5 T, we can plug in the values and solve for Δλ:\n\n0.5 T = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2 * 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (1/(6.563 x 10^-7 m) - 1/((6.563 x 10^-7 m) + Δλ))\n\nSolving for Δλ, we get:\n\nΔλ ≈ 1.17 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the lines for a magnetic field strength of 0.5 T is approximately:\n\nλ1 = 6.563 x 10^-7 m - Δλ/2 ≈ 6.563 x 10^-7 m - 5.85 x 10^-12 m = 6.563 x 10^-7 m\nλ2 = 6.563 x 10^-7 m\nλ3 = 6.563 x 10^-7 m + Δλ/2 ≈ 6.563 x 10^-7 m + 5.85 x 10^-12 m = 6.563 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelengths of the three components are approximately the same due to the small value of Δλ."
