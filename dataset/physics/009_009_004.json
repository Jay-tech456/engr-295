    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance from the lens, and v is the image distance from the lens.\n\nThe magnification formula is given by:\nM = -v/u\n\nWhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance from the lens, and u is the object distance from the lens.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The focal length of the lens, f = 10 cm\n- The image formed is twice the size of the object, so M = 2\n\nWe need to find the object distance (u) and the image distance (v).\n\nFirst, let's use the magnification formula to express v in terms of u:\nM = -v/u\n2 = -v/u\nv = -2u\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for v into the lens formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/u + 1/(-2u)\n\nTo solve for u, we can find a common denominator and combine the fractions:\n1/10 = (1 - 2)/(-2u)\n1/10 = -1/(-2u)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n-2u = -10\nu = 5 cm\n\nNow that we have the object distance (u), we can find the image distance (v) using the expression we found earlier:\nv = -2u\nv = -2(5)\nv = -10 cm\n\nSo, the object is 5 cm away from the lens, and the image is formed 10 cm away from the lens on the same side as the object (since the image distance is negative, which indicates a virtual image)."
