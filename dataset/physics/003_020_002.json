    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor has two parallel plates with dimensions 20 cm × 15 cm each, separated by a distance of 1 mm. A current of 2.5 A is passed through the plates in the same direction. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the center of the capacitor between its plates.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point between the plates of the capacitor, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the plates are large and the point is relatively close to the center, we can approximate the magnetic field using Ampere's law.\n\nAmpere's law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the distance (d) between the plates:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A. The current (I) is 2.5 A, and the distance (d) from the center of the capacitor to the point of interest is 5 cm or 0.05 m.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\nB = (10^(-7) * 2.5) / 0.05\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 5 cm from the center of the capacitor between its plates is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla).\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the magnetic field. Since the current is flowing in the same direction in both plates, the magnetic field produced by each plate will be in the same direction at the point between the plates. We can use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current and curl your fingers, the direction of your fingers represents the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field at the point between the plates will be perpendicular to the plates and pointing outwards from the center of the capacitor."
