Assume the initial photon energy is 100 keV and the momentum of the recoiled hydrogen atom is negligible compared to the photon momentum.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in energy of a photon undergoing Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle (45 degrees in this case).\n\nFirst, let's convert the initial photon energy (100 keV) to its wavelength using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon and λ is its wavelength.\n\nConverting 100 keV to Joules: 100 keV * (1.602 x 10^-16 J/eV) = 1.602 x 10^-14 J\n\nNow, we can find the initial wavelength of the photon:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.602 x 10^-14 J) = 1.239 x 10^-10 m\n\nNext, we can calculate the change in wavelength using the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(45°))\nΔλ = 2.426 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can find the final wavelength of the scattered photon:\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ = 1.239 x 10^-10 m + 2.426 x 10^-12 m = 1.263 x 10^-10 m\n\nFinally, we can calculate the final energy of the scattered photon:\n\nE' = h * c / λ' = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.263 x 10^-10 m) = 1.572 x 10^-14 J\n\nConverting the final energy back to keV: E' = 1.572 x 10^-14 J / (1.602 x 10^-16 J/eV) = 98.1 keV\n\nThe change in energy of the photon is the difference between the initial and final energies:\n\nΔE = E - E' = 100 keV - 98.1 keV = 1.9 keV"
