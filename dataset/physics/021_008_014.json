    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes, we can use some basic principles from general relativity and the physics of gravitational waves. The frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves depend on the masses of the black holes, their distance from each other, and their relative velocities.\n\nFor the merger of two black holes with masses of 10 solar masses (M1) and 20 solar masses (M2), we can first calculate the total mass (M) and the reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 10 M_sun + 20 M_sun = 30 M_sun\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (10 M_sun * 20 M_sun) / 30 M_sun = 200/3 M_sun\n\nThe frequency of the emitted gravitational waves during the inspiral phase (before the actual merger) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / M^2) * (μ / M) * (1 / r^3)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the separation between the black holes. The frequency increases as the black holes get closer to each other.\n\nThe amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * μ / c^4) * (M / r) * (1 / D)\n\nwhere D is the distance from the source to the observer. The amplitude increases as the black holes get closer to each other and decreases with increasing distance from the observer.\n\nFor black holes with different masses, the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves will also change. In general, the frequency increases as the total mass of the system decreases, while the amplitude increases with increasing reduced mass and total mass of the system. Additionally, the frequency and amplitude depend on the separation between the black holes and the distance from the observer, as mentioned earlier.\n\nIt is important to note that these are rough estimates and more accurate calculations require numerical simulations of the merger process, which take into account the complex dynamics of the black holes and the emitted gravitational waves."
