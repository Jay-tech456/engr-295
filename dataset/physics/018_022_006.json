    "message_1": "What is the probability of the decay of a free neutron to the final state with a proton, electron, and antineutrino given a time of 15 minutes, assuming the neutron is at rest and there are no external factors affecting the decay process?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a free neutron decaying into a proton, electron, and antineutrino within a given time, we can use the formula:\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ)\n\nwhere P(t) is the probability of decay within time t, τ is the mean lifetime of a neutron, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nThe mean lifetime of a free neutron is approximately 881.5 seconds. To find the probability of decay within 15 minutes (900 seconds), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(900) = 1 - e^(-900/881.5)\n\nP(900) = 1 - e^(-1.021)\n\nP(900) ≈ 1 - e^(-1)\n\nP(900) ≈ 1 - 0.368\n\nP(900) ≈ 0.632\n\nSo, the probability of a free neutron decaying into a proton, electron, and antineutrino within 15 minutes is approximately 63.2%."
