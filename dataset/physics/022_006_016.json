    "message_2": "The nature of the interaction between dark matter and normal matter is not yet fully understood. However, it is widely believed that dark matter interacts with normal matter primarily through gravitational forces. Dark matter is thought to be a type of non-baryonic matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect electromagnetic waves. Despite this, dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, with normal (baryonic) matter making up only about 5%.\n\nObserving the interaction between dark matter and normal matter experimentally is challenging due to the elusive nature of dark matter. However, several experimental techniques have been developed to detect dark matter indirectly or to search for its direct interactions with normal matter. Some of these techniques include:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: This method relies on the fact that massive objects, like dark matter, can bend light due to their gravitational influence. By observing the distortion of light from distant galaxies, astronomers can infer the presence of dark matter and study its distribution in the universe. This technique has been used to create maps of dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters.\n\n2. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements: The CMB is the radiation left over from the Big Bang. By studying the tiny temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can learn about the distribution of dark matter in the early universe. The presence of dark matter affects the way that the CMB radiation is distributed, and by analyzing these patterns, researchers can infer the properties of dark matter.\n\n3. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation curves of galaxies provide evidence for the existence of dark matter. Observations show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxies. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n4. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the interaction of dark matter particles with normal matter directly. They typically involve highly sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. The detectors are designed to measure the tiny amounts of energy deposited when dark matter particles collide with the atoms in the detector. Examples of such experiments include the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the XENON1T experiment, and the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS).\n\n5. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays. For example, if dark matter particles annihilate each other, they may produce gamma rays, neutrinos, or other particles that can be detected by telescopes or other instruments. Examples of such experiments include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\nDespite these experimental efforts, the nature of dark matter and its interactions with normal matter remain elusive. However, ongoing research and the development of new experimental techniques continue to improve our understanding of this mysterious component of the universe."
