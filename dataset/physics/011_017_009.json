    "message_2": "The maximal polarization in a ferroelectric material, also known as the spontaneous polarization, generally decreases with increasing temperature. This is because the thermal energy causes the dipoles in the material to become more disordered, reducing the overall polarization. The relationship between polarization and temperature can be described by the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nP(T) = P(0) * (1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nwhere P(T) is the polarization at temperature T, P(0) is the polarization at 0 K, Tc is the critical temperature (Curie temperature), and β is the critical exponent.\n\nThe critical temperature (Tc) is the temperature at which the material loses its ferroelectric properties and undergoes a phase transition from a ferroelectric to a paraelectric phase. Above this temperature, the material no longer exhibits spontaneous polarization and the hysteresis loop disappears.\n\nTo determine the critical temperature, one can analyze the temperature-dependent ferroelectric hysteresis loop for a given crystal. As the temperature increases, the hysteresis loop will become narrower and the remanent polarization will decrease. At the critical temperature, the hysteresis loop will collapse, and the material will no longer exhibit ferroelectric properties.\n\nTo find Tc experimentally, one can measure the polarization as a function of temperature and electric field, and then plot the hysteresis loops at different temperatures. By observing the temperature at which the hysteresis loop disappears, one can determine the critical temperature for the given crystal. Alternatively, one can also measure the dielectric constant as a function of temperature and look for a peak, which corresponds to the critical temperature."
