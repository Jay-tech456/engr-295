    "message_2": "To calculate the change in vapor pressure when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 100°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we first need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\nT2 = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given the vapor pressure at 25°C (P1) as 3.17 kPa, and we need to find the vapor pressure at 100°C (P2). The enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) is given as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/3.17) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/373.15 - 1/298.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 3.17 * exp(-(40700) / (8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/298.15))\nP2 ≈ 101.42 kPa\n\nNow we can find the change in vapor pressure:\n\nΔP = P2 - P1\nΔP ≈ 101.42 kPa - 3.17 kPa\nΔP ≈ 98.25 kPa\n\nSo, the change in vapor pressure of water when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 100°C is approximately 98.25 kPa."
