    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as observed from Earth, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the original length, v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, L0 = 200 meters, v = 0.8c, and c is the speed of light.\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 200 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 200 * 0.6\n\nL = 120 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship according to an observer on Earth is 120 meters."
