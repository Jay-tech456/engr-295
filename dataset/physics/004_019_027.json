    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational time dilation effect on the spaceship, we need to consider both the gravitational time dilation due to the black hole's gravity and the time dilation due to the spaceship's velocity (special relativity). \n\nFirst, let's consider the time dilation due to the spaceship's velocity. The spaceship is traveling at 80% the speed of light (0.8c), where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). Using the Lorentz factor formula for time dilation:\n\nLorentz factor (γ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the spaceship's velocity.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, let's consider the gravitational time dilation due to the black hole's gravity. The formula for gravitational time dilation is:\n\nGravitational time dilation factor (G) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2GM / (Rc^2)))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and R is the distance from the center of the black hole to the spaceship.\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for M and R. To proceed, we would need more information about the black hole's mass and the distance between the spaceship and the black hole.\n\nOnce we have the values for M and R, we can calculate the gravitational time dilation factor (G) and then multiply it by the Lorentz factor (γ) to get the total time dilation effect on the spaceship:\n\nTotal time dilation effect = γ * G"
