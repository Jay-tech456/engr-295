    "message_1": "What is the maximum energy level of cosmic rays, and how does this limit the feasibility of long-distance space travel for humans in terms of radiation exposure?",
    "message_2": "The maximum energy level of cosmic rays is typically measured in electron volts (eV). The most energetic cosmic rays detected so far are known as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), with energies reaching up to 10^20 eV or even higher. These extremely energetic particles are quite rare, but lower-energy cosmic rays are more common and still pose a significant threat to astronauts during long-distance space travel.\n\nCosmic rays are composed mainly of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, which can penetrate spacecraft and human bodies, causing damage to cells and increasing the risk of cancer and other health issues. The Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field provide a natural shield against cosmic rays, but astronauts in deep space lack this protection.\n\nThe feasibility of long-distance space travel for humans is limited by the radiation exposure from cosmic rays. To minimize the risk, spacecraft must be designed with effective radiation shielding, which can be achieved through various methods, such as using materials with high hydrogen content or employing active shielding techniques like magnetic fields.\n\nAdditionally, mission durations should be kept as short as possible to reduce the cumulative radiation dose received by astronauts. The longer the mission, the higher the risk of radiation exposure. For example, a mission to Mars would take several months, during which astronauts would be exposed to a significant amount of cosmic radiation.\n\nIn summary, the maximum energy level of cosmic rays (up to 10^20 eV) poses a challenge to the feasibility of long-distance space travel for humans due to the increased risk of radiation exposure. To mitigate this risk, spacecraft must be designed with effective radiation shielding, and mission durations should be minimized. Further research and technological advancements in radiation protection are necessary to enable safe and sustainable human space exploration."
