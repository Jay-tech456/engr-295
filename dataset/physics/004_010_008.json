    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. It is given by the formula:\n\n$r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole is $10^9 M_{\\odot}$, we first need to convert this mass to kilograms. The mass of the Sun ($M_{\\odot}$) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\n$M = 10^9 M_{\\odot} = 10^9 \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{30} kg = 1.989 \\times 10^{39} kg$\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula for the Schwarzschild radius:\n\n$r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2} \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{39} kg}{(3.0 \\times 10^8 m/s)^2}$\n\n$r_s = \\frac{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{39}}{9.0 \\times 10^{16}} m$\n\n$r_s \\approx 2.954 \\times 10^{22} m$\n\nTo convert the Schwarzschild radius to kilometers, we divide by 1000:\n\n$r_s \\approx 2.954 \\times 10^{19} km$\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole of mass $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ is approximately $2.954 \\times 10^{19}$ kilometers."
