    "message_2": "The ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the outermost shell of the atom. For a hydrogen atom, the ionization energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number (energy level).\n\nFor a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1), the ionization energy is:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nSince we are looking for the energy required to remove the electron, we take the absolute value:\n\nIonization energy = 13.6 eV\n\nFor the first excited state of hydrogen (n = 2):\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 2^2) = -3.4 eV\n\nAgain, taking the absolute value:\n\nIonization energy = 3.4 eV\n\nNow, let's compare this to the ionization energy of a helium atom in its ground state. Helium has an atomic number of 2, and its electron configuration is 1sÂ², so both electrons are in the n = 1 energy level:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (2^2 / 1^2) = -54.4 eV\n\nTaking the absolute value:\n\nIonization energy = 54.4 eV\n\nIn summary, the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV in its ground state and 3.4 eV in its first excited state, while the ionization energy of a helium atom in its ground state is 54.4 eV. The ionization energy of helium is significantly higher than that of hydrogen due to the increased nuclear charge, which attracts the electrons more strongly."
