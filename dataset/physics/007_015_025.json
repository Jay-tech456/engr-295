    "message_2": "To calculate the repulsive force between two protons, we can use Coulomb's Law. The formula for Coulomb's Law is:\n\nF = (k * q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force between the two charges, k is Coulomb's constant (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the two protons, and r is the distance between the charges.\n\nThe charge of a proton is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 C. Since both charges are protons, q1 = q2 = 1.602 × 10^-19 C. The distance between the protons is given as 10 femtometers, which is equal to 10 × 10^-15 meters.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nF = (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (1.602 × 10^-19 C)^2 / (10 × 10^-15 m)^2\n\nF = (8.9875 × 10^9 N m^2 C^-2) * (2.5664 × 10^-38 C^2) / (1 × 10^-28 m^2)\n\nF ≈ 2.306 × 10^-10 N\n\nThe repulsive force between the two protons is approximately 2.306 × 10^-10 N."
