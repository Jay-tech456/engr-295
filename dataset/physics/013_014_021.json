    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency range of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, we can use the following formula for the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * M / r^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the total mass of the binary system, and r is the orbital separation.\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the neutron stars from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nMass of each neutron star = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nTotal mass of the binary system, M = 2 * 2.7846 x 10^30 kg = 5.5692 x 10^30 kg\n\nNext, let's convert the orbital separation from 1000 km to meters:\n\nr = 1000 km * 1000 m/km = 1 x 10^6 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * M / r^3)^(1/2)\nf = (1 / π) * ((6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.5692 x 10^30 kg) / (1 x 10^6 m)^3)^(1/2)\n\nf ≈ (1 / π) * (1.233 x 10^-4)^(1/2)\nf ≈ (1 / π) * 0.0111\nf ≈ 0.00353 Hz\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves emitted by this binary neutron star system is approximately 0.00353 Hz. However, this is the frequency at the given orbital separation of 1000 km. As the neutron stars get closer and eventually merge, the frequency will increase. The frequency range of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers is typically between 10 Hz and several thousand Hz, depending on the masses and orbital parameters of the system."
