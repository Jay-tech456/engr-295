    "message_2": "Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) is a high-temperature superconductor with the general formula YBa2Cu3O7-x, where x represents the oxygen deficiency. The critical temperature (Tc) for the superconductivity transition in YBCO depends on the oxygen content, which affects the material's crystal structure and electronic properties.\n\nThe highest critical temperature for YBCO is around 92 K (-181 °C or -294 °F) when x is close to 0. This occurs in the orthorhombic phase of YBCO, where the oxygen content is near its maximum (YBa2Cu3O7). In this phase, the copper-oxygen chains are fully occupied by oxygen atoms, and the superconducting properties are optimal.\n\nAs the oxygen content decreases (x increases), the critical temperature for superconductivity decreases. This is because the removal of oxygen atoms from the copper-oxygen chains leads to a change in the electronic structure, which in turn affects the superconducting properties. When x is around 1 (YBa2Cu3O6), the material enters the tetragonal phase, and the superconductivity is lost.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature for the superconductivity transition in YBCO depends on the oxygen content in the material. The highest Tc of about 92 K is achieved when the oxygen content is near its maximum, and it decreases as the oxygen content decreases."
