    "message_2": "The nebular hypothesis is a widely accepted model that explains the formation and dynamics of planets in our Solar System. According to this hypothesis, the Solar System formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, called the solar nebula, which eventually collapsed under its own gravity. As the nebula contracted, it flattened into a spinning protoplanetary disk, with the Sun forming at its center. Over time, solid particles within the disk began to collide and stick together, forming planetesimals, which eventually grew into planets and other celestial bodies.\n\nThe composition of the protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role in determining the types of planets that form within a solar system. The disk can be broadly divided into two regions: the inner, warmer region, and the outer, cooler region. The temperature gradient within the disk influences the types of materials that can condense and form solid particles, which in turn affects the types of planets that can form.\n\nIn the inner region of the protoplanetary disk, temperatures are high, and only materials with high melting points, such as metals and silicates, can condense into solid particles. These materials form the building blocks of terrestrial planets, like Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Terrestrial planets are characterized by their rocky composition, relatively small size, and high densities.\n\nIn the outer region of the protoplanetary disk, temperatures are much lower, allowing more volatile materials, such as water, ammonia, and methane, to condense into solid particles known as ices. These ices, along with the solid particles from the inner region, form the cores of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. As these cores grow larger, their gravitational pull becomes strong enough to attract and retain massive amounts of hydrogen and helium gas from the surrounding nebula, leading to the formation of gas giants.\n\nIn summary, the nebular hypothesis provides a framework for understanding the formation and dynamics of planets in our Solar System. The composition of the protoplanetary disk, particularly the temperature gradient, plays a significant role in determining the types of planets that form, with terrestrial planets forming in the warmer inner region and gas giants forming in the cooler outer region."
