    "message_1": "A particle is moving with a speed of 0.8c along the x-axis. At t=0, it is located at the origin of an inertial frame of reference. What is the trajectory of the particle as observed from a frame of reference moving with a velocity of 0.6c in the positive y-direction relative to the original frame of reference?",
    "message_2": "To find the trajectory of the particle as observed from the moving frame of reference, we need to use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let's denote the original frame of reference as S and the moving frame of reference as S'. The velocity of S' relative to S is 0.6c in the positive y-direction.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nx' = γ(x - vt)\nt' = γ(t - vx/c^2)\n\nwhere x and t are the coordinates in the original frame S, x' and t' are the coordinates in the moving frame S', v is the relative velocity between the frames (0.6c), and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nFor v = 0.6c, the Lorentz factor γ is:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, in the original frame S, the trajectory of the particle is given by:\n\nx = 0.8c * t\ny = 0 (since the particle is only moving along the x-axis)\n\nWe can now use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the trajectory in the moving frame S':\n\nx' = γ(x - vt) = 1.25 * (0.8c * t - 0.6c * t) = 0.25c * t\nt' = γ(t - vx/c^2) = 1.25 * (t - 0.6c * 0.8c * t/c^2) = 0.7 * t\n\nNow, we can express the trajectory in terms of x' and y':\n\nx' = 0.25c * t\ny' = 0 (since the particle is not moving in the y-direction in frame S')\n\nHowever, we need to express the trajectory in terms of t' instead of t. To do this, we can solve the t' equation for t:\n\nt = t' / 0.7\n\nNow, substitute this expression for t into the x' equation:\n\nx' = 0.25c * (t' / 0.7) = (0.25c / 0.7) * t'\n\nSo, the trajectory of the particle in the moving frame S' is:\n\nx' = (0.25c / 0.7) * t'\ny' = 0\n\nThis means that the particle is still moving along the x'-axis in the moving frame S', but with a different speed of (0.25c / 0.7) ≈ 0.357c."
