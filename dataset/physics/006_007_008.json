    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated by an electric potential and collide with mercury atoms. The minimum accelerating potential needed to excite mercury atoms is the potential that provides the electrons with enough energy to excite the mercury atoms to their first excited state.\n\nThe energy of an electron in an electric field is given by:\n\nE = eV\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), and V is the electric potential.\n\nWe are given that the first excited state of mercury has an energy of 4.9 eV. To excite the mercury atoms, the electrons must have at least this much energy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n4.9 eV = eV_min\n\nTo find the minimum accelerating potential (V_min), we can divide both sides of the equation by the elementary charge (e):\n\nV_min = 4.9 eV / e\n\nV_min = 4.9 eV / (1.6 x 10^-19 C)\n\nV_min â‰ˆ 3.06 x 10^7 V\n\nSo, the minimum accelerating potential needed to excite mercury atoms in the Franck-Hertz experiment is approximately 3.06 x 10^7 V."
