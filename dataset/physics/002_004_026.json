    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of ethylene gas, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion, ΔH_f(products) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, and ΔH_f(reactants) is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we have:\n\nC2H4(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation values are given as:\n\nΔH_f(C2H4) = 52.3 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nSince O2 is in its elemental form, its standard enthalpy of formation is 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion:\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 2 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(C2H4) + 3 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [52.3 kJ/mol + 3 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nΔH_combustion = (-787 kJ + -571.6 kJ) - 52.3 kJ\n\nΔH_combustion = -1358.6 kJ - 52.3 kJ\n\nΔH_combustion = -1410.9 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of ethylene gas at standard conditions is -1410.9 kJ."
