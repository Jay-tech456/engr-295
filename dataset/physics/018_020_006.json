    "message_2": "Dark Matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to account for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of Dark Matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. Since the Standard Model of particle physics does not provide a suitable candidate for Dark Matter, several extensions and modifications have been proposed. Some of the most promising candidates for Dark Matter particles beyond the Standard Model include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through weak nuclear force and gravity. They are considered the most well-motivated Dark Matter candidates due to their natural appearance in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. The most popular WIMP candidate is the neutralino, which is a linear combination of the neutral supersymmetric partners of the photon, Z boson, and Higgs boson. Direct detection experiments, such as XENON1T and LUX, search for WIMPs by looking for nuclear recoils caused by WIMP-nucleus scattering. Indirect detection experiments, like Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S., search for WIMPs by detecting the products of their annihilation or decay.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are light, neutral, and very weakly interacting, making them suitable Dark Matter candidates. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) are two leading experiments searching for axions. ADMX looks for axions produced by the conversion of Dark Matter axions into photons in a strong magnetic field, while CAST searches for axions produced in the Sun by converting solar axions into X-ray photons.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through any of the known fundamental forces except gravity. They are right-handed counterparts to the left-handed neutrinos in the Standard Model. Sterile neutrinos could be produced in the early universe through oscillations with ordinary neutrinos and could account for Dark Matter. Experiments like IceCube and MiniBooNE search for sterile neutrinos by looking for anomalies in neutrino oscillation data.\n\n4. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs): PBHs are black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could potentially account for some or all of the Dark Matter. Gravitational lensing and the cosmic microwave background radiation can provide indirect evidence for PBHs. The LIGO and Virgo experiments, which detect gravitational waves, can also provide insights into the existence of PBHs.\n\nTo confirm or refute the existence of these Dark Matter candidates, we can continue to improve the sensitivity and precision of the current experiments, as well as develop new experimental techniques. Additionally, we can refine our theoretical models and simulations to better understand the expected properties and behavior of these candidates. Ultimately, a combination of theoretical and experimental advances will be necessary to identify the true nature of Dark Matter."
