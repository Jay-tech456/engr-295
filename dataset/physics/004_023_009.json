    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency, amplitude, and duration of gravitational waves emitted from the merger of two black holes, we can use the following information:\n\nMass of black hole 1 (m1) = 30 solar masses\nMass of black hole 2 (m2) = 40 solar masses\nDistance from Earth (D) = 1 billion light years\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = m1 + m2 = 30 + 40 = 70 solar masses\nμ = (m1 * m2) / M = (30 * 40) / 70 ≈ 17.14 solar masses\n\nNow, we can calculate the chirp mass (M_c), which is a combination of the total mass and reduced mass:\n\nM_c = μ^(3/5) * M^(2/5) ≈ 19.25 solar masses\n\nTo find the frequency of the gravitational waves, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / M_c) * (1 / t^(8/3))\n\nHere, f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time before the merger. The frequency increases as the black holes get closer, so we'll calculate the frequency at the time when the black holes are about to merge (t = 0):\n\nf ≈ (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / 19.25) * (1 / 0^(8/3)) ≈ 157 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves using the following formula:\n\nA = (4 * G * M_c) / (c^2 * D)\n\nHere, A is the amplitude and D is the distance from Earth. We need to convert the distance from light years to meters:\n\n1 light year ≈ 9.461 x 10^15 meters\nD ≈ 1 billion light years * 9.461 x 10^15 meters/light year ≈ 9.461 x 10^24 meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nA ≈ (4 * G * 19.25 * solar mass) / (c^2 * 9.461 x 10^24 meters) ≈ 1.2 x 10^-22\n\nFinally, to estimate the duration of the gravitational wave signal, we can use the following formula:\n\nt_duration ≈ (5 / 256) * (c^5 / G^3) * (1 / M_c^5) ≈ 0.2 seconds\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves is about 157 Hz, the amplitude is about 1.2 x 10^-22, and the duration of the gravitational wave signal is about 0.2 seconds."
