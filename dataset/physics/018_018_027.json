    "message_2": "Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter that is believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang, where quarks and gluons are not confined within protons and neutrons but rather move freely in a high-energy, high-temperature environment. Heavy-ion collisions, such as those carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are designed to recreate these extreme conditions to study the properties of QGP.\n\nThe behavior of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions can be influenced by the collision energy. As the energy of the collision increases, several differences in the properties and behavior of the QGP can be observed:\n\n1. Temperature and energy density: Higher collision energies result in higher temperatures and energy densities within the QGP. This can lead to a more pronounced transition from the confined hadronic phase to the deconfined quark-gluon phase. The critical temperature for this transition is estimated to be around 150-170 MeV.\n\n2. System size and lifetime: At higher collision energies, the system created in the collision tends to be larger and has a longer lifetime. This allows for more detailed study of the properties of the QGP, such as its viscosity, thermalization, and the dynamics of its expansion and cooling.\n\n3. Particle production: As the collision energy increases, the number of produced particles, including both hadrons and partons (quarks and gluons), also increases. This can lead to a higher level of collectivity and stronger flow patterns in the QGP, which can be observed through various experimental observables, such as the anisotropic flow coefficients.\n\n4. Jet quenching: At higher collision energies, the energy loss of high-momentum partons traversing the QGP, known as jet quenching, becomes more pronounced. This can be observed through the suppression of high transverse momentum particles and the modification of jet shapes and fragmentation functions.\n\n5. Chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement: At higher collision energies, the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks and gluons are expected to occur simultaneously. This can lead to the production of various exotic states of matter, such as color glass condensate and quarkyonic matter, which can have unique signatures in experimental observables.\n\nIn summary, the behavior of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions is strongly influenced by the collision energy. Higher collision energies lead to higher temperatures, energy densities, and particle production, which in turn affect the properties and dynamics of the QGP. Studying these differences helps physicists understand the fundamental properties of QGP and the strong force that governs the interactions between quarks and gluons."
