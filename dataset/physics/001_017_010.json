Before performing any operation on these qubits, the system is found to be in the following state:\n\n|ψ⟩ = (0.6)|0000⟩ + (0.8)|1111⟩\n\nIf one of the qubits is affected by an error, causing it to flip from |0⟩ to |1⟩, what will be the new state of the system?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the error-affected qubit by X. Since we don't know which qubit is affected, we need to consider all possibilities. The new state of the system can be represented as:\n\n|ψ'⟩ = a|X000⟩ + b|X111⟩ + c|0X00⟩ + d|1X11⟩ + e|00X0⟩ + f|11X1⟩ + g|000X⟩ + h|111X⟩\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are coefficients that we need to determine. We know that the initial state of the system is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = (0.6)|0000⟩ + (0.8)|1111⟩\n\nNow, let's consider each possibility of the qubit flip:\n\n1. First qubit flips:\n|ψ1⟩ = (0.6)|1000⟩ + (0.8)|0111⟩\n\n2. Second qubit flips:\n|ψ2⟩ = (0.6)|0100⟩ + (0.8)|1011⟩\n\n3. Third qubit flips:\n|ψ3⟩ = (0.6)|0010⟩ + (0.8)|1101⟩\n\n4. Fourth qubit flips:\n|ψ4⟩ = (0.6)|0001⟩ + (0.8)|1110⟩\n\nSince we don't know which qubit is affected, we need to consider a superposition of all these possibilities. The new state of the system will be:\n\n|ψ'⟩ = 1/2 (|ψ1⟩ + |ψ2⟩ + |ψ3⟩ + |ψ4⟩)\n\n|ψ'⟩ = 1/2 [(0.6)|1000⟩ + (0.8)|0111⟩ + (0.6)|0100⟩ + (0.8)|1011⟩ + (0.6)|0010⟩ + (0.8)|1101⟩ + (0.6)|0001⟩ + (0.8)|1110⟩]\n\nThe factor of 1/2 is included to normalize the state, as the probability of each qubit flip occurring is equal."
