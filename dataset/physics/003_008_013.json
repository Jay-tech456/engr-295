    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the sheet, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the current element, θ is the angle between the current element and the line connecting the current element to point P, and r is the distance between the current element and point P.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the sheet, we can consider a small strip of width dx at a distance x from the center of the sheet along its length (10 cm). The current in this strip can be expressed as:\n\ndI = (I * dx) / L\n\nwhere L is the length of the sheet (10 cm) and I is the total current (4 A).\n\nNow, let's consider a point P above the center of the sheet at a height h (2 cm). The distance r between the strip and point P can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr = sqrt(h² + x²)\n\nThe angle θ between the strip and the line connecting the strip to point P is 90 degrees since the current is flowing along the width of the sheet and the line connecting the strip to point P is perpendicular to the sheet. Therefore, sinθ = 1.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law equation:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * W * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere W is the width of the sheet (5 cm).\n\nIntegrating both sides of the equation with respect to x from -L/2 to L/2, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W) / (4 * π * L) * ∫((-L/2) to (L/2)) dx / (h² + x²)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nx = h * tan(φ)\n\ndx = h * sec²(φ) dφ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W) / (4 * π * L) * ∫((-π/2) to (π/2)) sec²(φ) dφ / (1 + tan²(φ))\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity 1 + tan²(φ) = sec²(φ), we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W) / (4 * π * L) * ∫((-π/2) to (π/2)) dφ\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to φ:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W) / (4 * π * L) * [φ]((-π/2) to (π/2))\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W) / (4 * π * L) * (π - (-π))\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * W * π) / (2 * L)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = 4 A\nW = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * 0.05 m * π) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) T)\n\nThe magnetic field at a point 2 cm above the center of the sheet is 2π × 10^(-6) T."
