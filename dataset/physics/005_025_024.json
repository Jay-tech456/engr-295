    "message_2": "The energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed v, with mass m, can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the particle, m is its mass, c is the speed of light, and p is its momentum. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nSubstituting the expression for momentum into the energy-momentum equation, we get:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (m^2v^2c^2 / (1 - (v^2/c^2)))\n\nNow, let's define the rest energy E0 as:\n\nE0 = mc^2\n\nThen, the equation for the total energy becomes:\n\nE^2 = E0^2 + (m^2v^2c^2 / (1 - (v^2/c^2)))\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by m^2c^4:\n\n(E/mc^2)^2 = (E0/mc^2)^2 + (v^2/c^2) / (1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nNow, let's define the dimensionless quantities γ (gamma) and β (beta) as:\n\nγ = E/E0 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\nβ = v/c\n\nThe equation for the total energy can now be written as:\n\nγ^2 = 1 + β^2 / (1 - β^2)\n\nSolving for γ, we get:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nFinally, the total energy E of the particle can be expressed in terms of its rest energy E0:\n\nE = γE0\n\nAt low speeds (v << c), β is close to 0, and γ is approximately equal to 1. In this case, the total energy E is approximately equal to the rest energy E0:\n\nE ≈ E0\n\nAt speeds close to the speed of light (v ≈ c), β approaches 1, and γ becomes much larger than 1. In this case, the total energy E is significantly greater than the rest energy E0:\n\nE >> E0"
