    "message_2": "The lifetime of the first excited state (n=2) in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Einstein A coefficient, which describes the probability of spontaneous emission from an excited state to a lower energy state. For the hydrogen atom transitioning from n=2 to n=1, the Einstein A coefficient (A21) is approximately 6.3 x 10^8 s^-1.\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of the first excited state can be calculated as the inverse of the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A21\n\nτ = 1 / (6.3 x 10^8 s^-1)\n\nτ ≈ 1.59 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the calculated lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.59 x 10^-9 seconds."
