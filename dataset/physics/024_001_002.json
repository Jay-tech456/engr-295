    "message_2": "The behavior of an ideal double pendulum is highly sensitive to its initial conditions, and it is a well-known example of a chaotic system. Due to its chaotic nature, it is impossible to predict the exact number of periods before the system becomes chaotic. Even a slight change in the initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes.\n\nThe lengths of the first and second pendulums do affect the behavior of the double pendulum, but they do not determine a specific number of periods before chaos ensues. Instead, the lengths of the pendulums, along with their masses and initial conditions, determine the overall dynamics of the system.\n\nIn summary, there is no maximum number of periods an ideal double pendulum can complete before becoming chaotic, as its behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions and can become chaotic almost immediately. The lengths of the pendulums do affect the dynamics of the system, but they do not determine a specific number of periods before chaos."
