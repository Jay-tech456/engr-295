    "message_2": "The temperature of the Universe's cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), which is just a few degrees above absolute zero. This radiation is a relic from the early Universe, and its existence provides strong evidence for the Big Bang theory of the creation of the Universe.\n\nThe Big Bang theory posits that the Universe began as an extremely hot and dense state, and has been expanding and cooling ever since. As the Universe expanded, the radiation within it also cooled down. The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its temperature is a snapshot of the Universe when it was around 380,000 years old.\n\nThe discovery of the CMB radiation in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was a major breakthrough in supporting the Big Bang theory. The radiation's uniform temperature across the sky and its blackbody spectrum are consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang model. Furthermore, the tiny fluctuations in the CMB's temperature, known as anisotropies, provide crucial information about the early Universe's density variations, which eventually led to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures we observe today.\n\nIn summary, the CMB radiation's temperature and properties serve as strong evidence for the Big Bang theory, as they align with the predictions of the model and offer insights into the early Universe's conditions and evolution."
