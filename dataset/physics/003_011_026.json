    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at the center of a circular disc of radius R and carrying a current I uniformly distributed over its surface? Assume that the disc lies on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the current.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the circular disc, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the differential length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, we can define a surface current density K = I / (πR²). Now, let's consider a small circular strip of radius r and thickness dr on the disc. The area of this strip is dA = 2πr dr, and the current flowing through it is dI = K dA = (2πr dr I) / R².\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB at the center of the disc due to this small strip:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the strip is circular and symmetric, the magnetic field at the center due to each small segment of the strip will have the same magnitude and direction. Therefore, we can consider only the magnitude of the magnetic field:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl) / r²\n\nThe length of the strip is dl = 2πr, so we can substitute it into the equation:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πr) / r²\n\nNow, we can substitute dI = (2πr dr I) / R²:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ((2πr dr I) / R² * 2πr) / r²\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dr) / R²\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = R) to find the total magnetic field B at the center:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dr) / R² from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / R²) * ∫dr from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / R²) * [r] from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / R²) * R\n\nB = μ₀ * I / R\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular disc is:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * I / R"
