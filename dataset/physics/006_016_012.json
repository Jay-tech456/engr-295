    "message_2": "To calculate the expected nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency in a hydrogen atom at a magnetic field strength of 3.0 Tesla, we need to use the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γ * B\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nFor a hydrogen nucleus (proton), the gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 42.58 MHz/T.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nω = (42.58 MHz/T) * (3.0 T)\n\nω ≈ 127.74 MHz\n\nSo, the expected NMR frequency for a hydrogen atom at a magnetic field strength of 3.0 Tesla is approximately 127.74 MHz."
