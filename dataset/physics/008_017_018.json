    "message_2": "The charmed (c) and bottom (b) quarks are heavier quarks that undergo weak decays, meaning they transform into lighter quarks through the weak force. The primary decay modes for charmed and bottom quarks are as follows:\n\n1. Charmed quark (c) decay:\nThe charmed quark primarily decays via the weak force into a strange quark (s) through the emission of a W+ boson (c → s + W+). The W+ boson then decays into either a lepton and a neutrino (W+ → l+ + ν) or a pair of lighter quarks (W+ → q1 + q2). The most common decay modes for the charmed quark are:\n\n- c → s + u + d (via W+ boson)\n- c → s + e+ + νe (via W+ boson)\n- c → s + μ+ + νμ (via W+ boson)\n\n2. Bottom quark (b) decay:\nThe bottom quark primarily decays via the weak force into a charm quark (c) through the emission of a W- boson (b → c + W-). The W- boson then decays into either a lepton and an antineutrino (W- → l- + ν̅) or a pair of lighter antiquarks (W- → q1 + q2). The most common decay modes for the bottom quark are:\n\n- b → c + u + d (via W- boson)\n- b → c + e- + ν̅e (via W- boson)\n- b → c + μ- + ν̅μ (via W- boson)\n\nThe decay rates of charmed and bottom quarks differ significantly due to their mass differences and the properties of the weak force. The bottom quark is heavier than the charmed quark, and as a result, it has a longer lifetime. The mean lifetime of a bottom quark is about 1.3 x 10^-12 seconds, while the mean lifetime of a charmed quark is about 1 x 10^-13 seconds. This means that the bottom quark decays about an order of magnitude slower than the charmed quark."
