    "message_2": "The key stages of the formation and evolution of black holes are:\n\n1. Stellar evolution: A massive star (at least 3 times the mass of the Sun) undergoes nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium, and then into heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and eventually iron.\n\n2. Core collapse: Once the core is composed mostly of iron, nuclear fusion ceases, and the core collapses under its own gravity. This collapse causes the outer layers of the star to implode, creating a supernova explosion.\n\n3. Formation of a black hole: If the remaining core mass is above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit (approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun), the core will continue to collapse until it forms a black hole. The black hole's initial properties, such as mass and angular momentum, depend on the properties of the collapsing core.\n\n4. Accretion of matter: The black hole can grow by accreting matter from its surroundings, such as gas and dust, or by merging with other black holes or neutron stars. The characteristics of the black hole, like its mass and spin, will change as it accretes matter or merges with other objects.\n\n5. Hawking radiation: According to quantum mechanics, black holes can emit Hawking radiation, which causes them to lose mass over time. This process is extremely slow for stellar-mass black holes and becomes significant only for very small black holes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Schwarzschild radius and Hawking radiation for a black hole formed from a collapsing star with a mass of 10 times that of the Sun.\n\nSchwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFor a black hole with a mass of 10 times the mass of the Sun (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg), we have:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius for this black hole is approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nHawking radiation is given by the formula:\n\nP = ħc^6 / (15360πG^2M^2)\n\nwhere P is the power emitted by the black hole, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 Js), and the other variables are as defined earlier.\n\nP = (1.054 x 10^-34 Js * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^6) / (15360π * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)^2)\nP ≈ 9.00 x 10^-29 W\n\nThe power emitted by this black hole due to Hawking radiation is approximately 9.00 x 10^-29 watts. This is an extremely small value, indicating that the black hole will lose mass very slowly due to Hawking radiation."
