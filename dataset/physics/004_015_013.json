    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, as well as on the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe exact nature and properties of dark matter are still not well understood, but it is believed to be composed of particles that do not interact with ordinary matter through the electromagnetic force. Several candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos. However, despite extensive experimental searches, none of these particles have been directly detected so far.\n\nAccording to the theory of general relativity, massive objects like galaxies and galaxy clusters curve the spacetime around them, causing nearby objects to move along curved paths. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the dynamics and structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters, as its gravitational influence helps to hold them together and shape their formation.\n\nObservations of galaxy rotation curves, which show the relationship between the orbital speed of stars and their distance from the galactic center, provide strong evidence for the presence of dark matter. In the absence of dark matter, the orbital speed of stars would decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center, following the distribution of visible matter. However, observations show that the orbital speed remains roughly constant at large distances, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\nDark matter also plays a key role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. Simulations of cosmic structure formation that include dark matter are able to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, as well as the properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Without dark matter, these simulations fail to produce the observed structures.\n\nIn summary, the current scientific understanding of dark matter is that it is a form of invisible, non-luminous matter that interacts primarily through gravity. Its presence has significant effects on the dynamics and structure of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. However, the exact nature and properties of dark matter particles remain unknown, and their direct detection remains one of the major challenges in modern physics."
