    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the rod on its axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a finite straight wire, also known as the Biot-Savart Law. The formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * L) / (4 * π * d * (L² + 4 * d²)^(1/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current (2.5 A)\nL is the length of the rod (0.5 m)\nd is the distance from the center of the rod on its axis (0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A * 0.5 m) / (4 * π * 0.1 m * (0.5² + 4 * 0.1²)^(1/2))\n\nB = (5π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.4π * (0.25 + 0.04)^(1/2))\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.4 * (0.29)^(1/2))\n\nB ≈ 2.89 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the rod on its axis is approximately 2.89 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
