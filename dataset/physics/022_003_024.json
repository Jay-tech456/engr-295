    "message_2": "The impact of dark matter on the rotation curve of spiral galaxies is significant. In a spiral galaxy, the rotation curve represents the relationship between the orbital speed of stars and gas clouds at different distances from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital speed should decrease as the distance from the center increases, following the distribution of visible matter (stars, gas, and dust).\n\nHowever, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotation curves remain flat or even slightly increase with distance from the center. This discrepancy between the expected and observed rotation curves led to the hypothesis of dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it undetectable through traditional means.\n\nDark matter is believed to form a halo around spiral galaxies, extending far beyond the visible edges of the galaxy. The presence of this dark matter halo provides additional gravitational force, which affects the motion of stars and gas clouds in the galaxy. This additional force is responsible for the observed flat rotation curves, as the gravitational pull of dark matter compensates for the decrease in visible matter density at larger distances from the center.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies is not uniform. It is thought to be more concentrated towards the center of the galaxy and gradually decrease in density as the distance from the center increases. This distribution is consistent with the observed flat rotation curves, as the dark matter's gravitational influence is stronger in the inner regions of the galaxy and weaker in the outer regions.\n\nIn summary, dark matter has a significant impact on the rotation curve of spiral galaxies by providing additional gravitational force that keeps the rotation curves flat or slightly increasing with distance from the center. This observation has led to the hypothesis of dark matter halos surrounding spiral galaxies, with a distribution that is more concentrated towards the center and gradually decreasing in density with increasing distance from the center."
