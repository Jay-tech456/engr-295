    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the interference pattern on the screen is formed due to the superposition of waves coming from two slits. The bright fringes are formed when the path difference between the waves is an integral multiple of the wavelength.\n\nThe formula for the position of the bright fringes is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe, m is the order of the bright fringe, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Distance between the slits and the screen (L) = 1 meter\n- Wavelength of light (λ) = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) meters\n- Angle for the fifth bright fringe (θ) = 0.12 radians\n- Order of the bright fringe (m) = 5\n\nWe need to find the distance between the two slits (d). Using the formula above, we can write:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for d:\n\nd * sin(0.12) = 5 * (600 * 10^(-9))\n\nd * 0.119365 = 5 * 600 * 10^(-9)\n\nd = (5 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / 0.119365\n\nd ≈ 2.512 * 10^(-5) meters\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in Young's Double Slit Experiment is approximately 2.512 * 10^(-5) meters or 25.12 μm."
