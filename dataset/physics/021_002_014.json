    "message_2": "When the mass of a black hole is doubled, several properties of the event horizon change. The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. The radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIf the mass of the black hole is doubled, the Schwarzschild radius will also double. This means that the event horizon will be larger, encompassing a greater volume of space around the black hole.\n\nHowever, the ability for matter and energy to escape the black hole remains unchanged. The event horizon still represents the point of no return, beyond which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. No matter or energy can escape from within the event horizon, regardless of the size of the black hole.\n\nIt is important to note that the gravitational force experienced by an object outside the event horizon will be stronger for a more massive black hole. This means that as the mass of the black hole increases, it becomes more likely for nearby objects to be pulled towards the event horizon and eventually be unable to escape the black hole's gravity."
