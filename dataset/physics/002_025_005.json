    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of the mixture, we can use a weighted average based on the mass percentages of ethanol and water in the mixture.\n\nLet's denote the specific heat capacity of the mixture as C_mix, the specific heat capacity of ethanol as C_ethanol, and the specific heat capacity of water as C_water. The mass percentages of ethanol and water are 30% and 70%, respectively.\n\nC_mix = (mass percentage of ethanol × C_ethanol) + (mass percentage of water × C_water)\n\nC_mix = (0.30 × 2.44 kJ/kg·K) + (0.70 × 4.18 kJ/kg·K)\n\nC_mix = (0.732 kJ/kg·K) + (2.926 kJ/kg·K)\n\nC_mix = 3.658 kJ/kg·K\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the mixture of 30% ethanol and 70% water at 25°C is 3.658 kJ/kg·K."
