    "message_2": "To create a plasma-based light source that emits ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 253.7 nm, we can use low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps as a reference. These lamps are known for emitting UV radiation at 253.7 nm, which is used for germicidal purposes.\n\nFor a low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp, the optimal gas pressure is typically around 1-10 Pa (0.01-0.1 mbar) of mercury vapor. The optimal temperature for the lamp's operation is around 40-60°C (104-140°F). At this temperature, the mercury vapor pressure is sufficient to produce the desired UV radiation.\n\nPlease note that working with mercury and UV radiation can be hazardous, and proper safety precautions should be taken when dealing with such materials and radiation."
