    "message_2": "When a uranium-235 nucleus absorbs a neutron, it undergoes fission and releases energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, kinetic energy of the emitted neutrons, and energy carried away by gamma photons. The total energy released in a single fission event is approximately 200 MeV.\n\nTo calculate the total energy released, we need to consider the initial kinetic energy of the neutron, which is given as 1 MeV. So, the total energy released in the fission process will be:\n\nTotal energy released = Energy released in fission + Initial kinetic energy of the neutron\nTotal energy released = 200 MeV + 1 MeV\nTotal energy released = 201 MeV\n\nSo, the amount of energy released when a uranium-235 nucleus undergoes fission by absorbing a neutron of kinetic energy 1 MeV is approximately 201 MeV."
