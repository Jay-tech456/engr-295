    "message_2": "W' and Z' bosons are hypothetical particles that are predicted to exist in various extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. These particles are expected to be heavier versions of the known W and Z bosons, which are responsible for the weak nuclear force. The predicted mass range for W' and Z' bosons depends on the specific theoretical model being considered.\n\n1. Sequential Standard Model (SSM): In this model, W' and Z' bosons are assumed to have similar properties to their lighter counterparts, but with larger masses. The mass range for these particles is typically expected to be in the TeV (tera-electronvolt) scale, with no specific upper limit.\n\n2. Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM): This model predicts the existence of W' and Z' bosons as a consequence of an extended gauge symmetry. The mass range for W' and Z' bosons in this model is also in the TeV scale, but the exact values depend on the details of the model, such as the breaking scale of the symmetry and the mixing angles between the particles.\n\n3. Technicolor Models: In these models, W' and Z' bosons arise as composite particles formed by new strongly interacting particles called technifermions. The mass range for W' and Z' bosons in technicolor models can vary widely, from a few hundred GeV (giga-electronvolt) to several TeV, depending on the specific model and the underlying dynamics.\n\n4. Extra-dimensional Models: In theories with extra spatial dimensions, W' and Z' bosons can appear as Kaluza-Klein excitations of the known W and Z bosons. The mass range for these particles depends on the size and geometry of the extra dimensions, and can range from a few hundred GeV to several TeV.\n\nExperimental searches for W' and Z' bosons are primarily conducted at high-energy collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. These searches typically involve looking for deviations from the Standard Model predictions in various processes, such as the production of high-mass dilepton or dijet resonances.\n\nSo far, no direct evidence for W' or Z' bosons has been found, and the experimental results have been used to set limits on their masses and couplings. For example, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have excluded the existence of SSM W' and Z' bosons with masses below about 4-5 TeV, and the existence of LRSM W' bosons with masses below about 3-4 TeV. These limits are generally consistent with the theoretical predictions, although they do not yet cover the entire parameter space of the models.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range for W' and Z' bosons in various theoretical models of particle physics is typically in the TeV scale, but the exact values depend on the specific model and its parameters. Current experimental searches at high-energy collider experiments have not yet found direct evidence for these particles, but they have set important limits on their masses and couplings, which are generally consistent with the theoretical predictions. Future collider experiments, such as the High-Luminosity LHC and potential future colliders, will continue to search for W' and Z' bosons and further probe the parameter space of these models."
