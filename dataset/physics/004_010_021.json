    "message_2": "The radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 5 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (9.945 × 10^30 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs ≈ 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11) × (9.945 × 10^30) / (9 × 10^16)\n\nRs ≈ 1.471 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14,710 meters or 14.71 kilometers."
