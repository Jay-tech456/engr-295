    "message_2": "The expected amplitude and frequency range of gravitational waves produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 1 to 10 solar masses can be estimated using the properties of binary black hole mergers.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary system is given by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * π * (2 * M))^(1/2)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the total mass of the binary system (sum of the two black hole masses). For PBHs with masses ranging from 1 to 10 solar masses, the frequency range can be estimated as follows:\n\nFor a binary system with two 1 solar mass black holes (M = 2 solar masses):\n\nf_min = (c^3 / G * π * (2 * 2 * M_sun))^(1/2) ≈ 157 Hz\n\nFor a binary system with two 10 solar mass black holes (M = 20 solar masses):\n\nf_max = (c^3 / G * π * (2 * 20 * M_sun))^(1/2) ≈ 49 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of GWs from PBHs with masses between 1 and 10 solar masses is approximately 49 Hz to 157 Hz.\n\nThe amplitude of GWs depends on the distance to the source, the masses of the black holes, and the orientation of the binary system. The characteristic strain amplitude can be estimated as:\n\nh_c = (G * M_chirp / c^2)^(5/3) * (π * f)^(2/3) / d_L\n\nwhere M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system, f is the GW frequency, and d_L is the luminosity distance to the source. For PBHs with masses between 1 and 10 solar masses, the amplitude will vary depending on these factors. However, the amplitude will generally be smaller for lower-mass systems and larger for higher-mass systems.\n\nTo optimize the detection of GWs from PBHs with masses between 1 and 10 solar masses, ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo can focus on improving their sensitivity in the frequency range of 49 Hz to 157 Hz. This can be achieved by reducing noise sources, improving the optical components, and enhancing the data analysis techniques. Additionally, collaborations with other detectors, such as KAGRA and LIGO-India, can help improve the localization and detection of GW signals from PBHs in this mass range."
