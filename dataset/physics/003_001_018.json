    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the current (I) is 2.5 A and the distance (r) is 10 cm (0.1 m), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.2\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-6) T / 0.2\nB = 12.5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field is 12.5 μT.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have information about the orientation of the wire, we cannot provide a specific direction. However, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction determined by the right-hand rule.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the straight wire carrying a current of 2.5 A at a distance of 10 cm is 12.5 μT, and the direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule."
