    "message_2": "In a 1+1 dimensional quantum field theory with a free massless scalar field, the entanglement entropy can be calculated using the well-known formula for the entanglement entropy of a conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions. The formula is given by:\n\nS = (c/3) * log(L/a),\n\nwhere S is the entanglement entropy, c is the central charge of the CFT, L is the length of the interval, and a is the UV cutoff (short-distance regularization).\n\nFor a free massless scalar field, the central charge c is equal to 1. Since we are considering the entanglement entropy reduced to a half line with a sharp boundary, the length L goes to infinity. However, the presence of a sharp boundary breaks the conformal symmetry, and the entanglement entropy will be affected by the boundary conditions.\n\nIn this case, the ground state breaks parity symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. This means that the boundary conditions are not the standard Dirichlet or Neumann conditions. Instead, we have to consider a more general boundary condition that satisfies these symmetries. One possible choice is the \"mixed\" boundary condition:\n\n∂_x φ(x=0) = αφ(x=0),\n\nwhere α is a constant parameter, and φ(x) is the scalar field. This boundary condition preserves time-reversal symmetry and breaks parity symmetry for non-zero α.\n\nTo calculate the entanglement entropy with this boundary condition, we can use the method of images. The method of images consists of extending the field configuration to the whole line by introducing an image field that satisfies the boundary condition. In this case, the image field is given by:\n\nφ'(x) = φ(-x) - (1/α)∂_x φ(-x).\n\nNow, we can calculate the entanglement entropy using the standard formula for the CFT on the whole line, but with the modified field configuration:\n\nS = (1/3) * log(L/a).\n\nSince L goes to infinity, the entanglement entropy will be divergent. However, the leading divergence will be proportional to the logarithm of the length of the interval, which is a universal result for 1+1 dimensional CFTs. The coefficient of the logarithmic divergence depends on the boundary condition and can be affected by the breaking of parity symmetry."
