    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. It is the point of no return for any object that crosses it. The event horizon is directly related to the Schwarzschild radius, which is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 10^6 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg), we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nM = 10^6 * M_sun = 10^6 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^36 kg\n\nRs = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^36 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^10 meters\n\nThe event horizon radius for this black hole is approximately 2.95 x 10^10 meters.\n\nTo calculate the gravitational pull (acceleration due to gravity) at the event horizon, we can use the formula:\n\ng = GM/Rs^2\n\ng = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^36 kg) / (2.95 x 10^10 m)^2\ng ≈ 1.52 x 10^13 m/s^2\n\nThe gravitational pull at the event horizon of this black hole is approximately 1.52 x 10^13 m/s^2."
