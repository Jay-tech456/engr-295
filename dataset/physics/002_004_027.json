The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for methane and carbon dioxide are -74.87 kJ/mol and -393.51 kJ/mol respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of methane, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nNext, we need to determine the moles of methane (CH₄) in 50.0 grams. The molar mass of CH₄ is 12.01 g/mol (C) + 4(1.01 g/mol) (H) = 16.05 g/mol.\n\nmoles of CH₄ = (50.0 g) / (16.05 g/mol) = 3.115 mol\n\nNow, we can use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) to calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(CO₂) + 2ΔHf°(H₂O)] - [ΔHf°(CH₄) + 2ΔHf°(O₂)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for O₂ is zero (it is an element in its standard state), the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔH = [ΔHf°(CO₂) + 2ΔHf°(H₂O)] - ΔHf°(CH₄)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH = [(-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2(-285.83 kJ/mol)] - (-74.87 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH = (-393.51 - 571.66 + 74.87) kJ/mol\n\nΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 3.115 mol of methane:\n\nΔH_total = (3.115 mol) × (-890.3 kJ/mol) = -2772.6 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction of 50.0 grams of methane at constant pressure is -2772.6 kJ."
