    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a quantum phenomenon that occurs at the event horizon of a black hole, where particle-antiparticle pairs are created due to the strong gravitational field. One of the particles falls into the black hole, while the other escapes, leading to a net loss of mass for the black hole. This process is also known as black hole evaporation.\n\nAs a black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation, its thermodynamics change in the following ways:\n\n1. Temperature: The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. As the black hole loses mass, its temperature increases. Mathematically, the temperature (T) is given by the equation:\n\nT = (ħc^3) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. As M decreases, T increases.\n\n2. Entropy: The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. As the black hole loses mass, its event horizon shrinks, and its entropy decreases. The entropy (S) is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\n\nS = (kc^3A) / (4ħG)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, A is the area of the event horizon, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant. As A decreases, S decreases.\n\n3. Evaporation time: As the black hole loses mass, the rate at which it loses mass through Hawking radiation increases. This is because the temperature of the black hole increases, leading to a higher rate of particle-antiparticle pair production. The evaporation time (τ) is given by:\n\nτ = (5120πG^2M^3) / (ħc^4)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. As M decreases, τ decreases, meaning the black hole evaporates faster.\n\nIn summary, as a black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation, its temperature increases, its entropy decreases, and its evaporation time decreases. These changes in thermodynamics ultimately lead to the complete evaporation of the black hole, leaving behind only thermal radiation."
