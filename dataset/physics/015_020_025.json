    "message_2": "To estimate the expected number of gravitational waves detected per year from binary white dwarfs within a distance of 100 Mpc, we need to consider several factors, including the merger rate, chirp mass distribution, and detector sensitivity.\n\n1. Merger rate: The merger rate of binary white dwarfs is estimated to be around 1 per 1000 years per Milky Way-sized galaxy (Abadie et al. 2010). \n\n2. Number of galaxies within 100 Mpc: The galaxy density in the local universe is about 0.01 galaxies per Mpc^3 (Karachentsev et al. 2004). Considering a volume of a sphere with a radius of 100 Mpc, we have:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (100 Mpc)^3 ≈ 4.19 * 10^6 Mpc^3\n\nThe number of galaxies within this volume is:\n\nN_galaxies = 0.01 galaxies/Mpc^3 * 4.19 * 10^6 Mpc^3 ≈ 4.19 * 10^4 galaxies\n\n3. Total merger rate within 100 Mpc: \n\nTotal_merger_rate = N_galaxies * Merger_rate_per_galaxy = 4.19 * 10^4 galaxies * (1 merger/1000 years/galaxy) = 41.9 mergers/year\n\n4. Detection probability: The sensitivity of the detector is given as 10^-22 Hz^-1/2. However, to estimate the detection probability, we need to know the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold for detection and the distribution of binary white dwarf parameters (e.g., chirp mass, distance, inclination). Without this information, we cannot directly compute the detection probability.\n\nAssuming a detection probability (P_detect) based on the detector sensitivity and the distribution of binary white dwarf parameters, we can estimate the expected number of detections per year:\n\nExpected_detections_per_year = Total_merger_rate * P_detect = 41.9 mergers/year * P_detect\n\nWithout more information on the distribution of binary white dwarf parameters and the SNR threshold for detection, we cannot provide a precise value for the expected number of detections per year. However, this framework can be used to estimate the number once the required information is available."
