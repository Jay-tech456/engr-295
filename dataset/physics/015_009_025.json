    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves generated by a binary neutron star system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency of the gravitational waves (f):\nf = 2 * (1 / P)\nwhere P is the orbital period of the binary system.\n\n2. Amplitude of the gravitational waves (h):\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * R) / (c^4 * d)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars, R is the distance between the neutron stars, c is the speed of light, and d is the distance from the binary system to Earth.\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nP = 8.4 milliseconds = 8.4 * 10^(-3) seconds\nf = 2 * (1 / P) = 2 / (8.4 * 10^(-3)) = 238.095 Hz\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude of the gravitational waves:\n\nG = 6.674 * 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)\nM1 = M2 = 1.4 * M_sun = 1.4 * 1.989 * 10^(30) kg\nR = (G * (M1 + M2) * P^2) / (4 * pi^2)^(1/3)\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\nd = 400 Mpc = 400 * 3.086 * 10^(22) m\n\nFirst, let's calculate R:\n\nR = ((6.674 * 10^(-11) * (2.8 * 1.989 * 10^(30)) * (8.4 * 10^(-3))^2) / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.953 * 10^4 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the amplitude:\n\nh = (4 * (6.674 * 10^(-11))^2 * (1.4 * 1.989 * 10^(30))^2 * 1.953 * 10^4) / ((3 * 10^8)^4 * 400 * 3.086 * 10^(22))\nh ≈ 1.18 * 10^(-22)\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves generated by the binary neutron star system is approximately 238.095 Hz, and the amplitude of the gravitational waves is approximately 1.18 * 10^(-22)."
