    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the formula:\n\nrelativistic mass (m) = rest mass (m0) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1000 kg\nv = 0.95c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.95c)^2 / c^2 = (0.95)^2 = 0.9025\n\nNow, let's find 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975\n\nNext, we'll find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.0975) ≈ 0.312\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1000 kg / 0.312 ≈ 3205.13 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship when it is traveling at 0.95c is approximately 3205.13 kg."
