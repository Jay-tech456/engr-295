What is the length of the same rod when measured by an observer on Earth? Use the Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to calculate the length contraction.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the length contraction, we can use the Lorentz contraction formula:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod measured by the observer on Earth, L0 is the proper length of the rod (measured by the astronaut on the spaceship), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma):\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36)\ngamma = 1/sqrt(0.64)\ngamma = 1/0.8\ngamma â‰ˆ 1.25\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz contraction formula to find the length of the rod as measured by the observer on Earth:\n\nL = L0 / gamma\nL = 5 meters / 1.25\nL = 4 meters\n\nSo, the length of the rod when measured by an observer on Earth is 4 meters."
