    "message_2": "The compressibility factor (Z) is a dimensionless quantity that is used to describe the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. It is defined as the ratio of the molar volume of a real gas to the molar volume of an ideal gas under the same temperature and pressure conditions. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nZ = (V_real) / (V_ideal)\n\nTo calculate the compressibility factor, we first need to find the molar volume of the ideal gas. We can use the ideal gas law for this purpose:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. \n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K\n\nNow, we need to find the number of moles (n) in the gas mixture. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the number of moles directly. However, we can still express the compressibility factor in terms of the unknown number of moles.\n\nRearranging the ideal gas law to solve for the molar volume of an ideal gas (V_ideal/n):\n\nV_ideal/n = RT/P\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nV_ideal/n = (0.0821 L atm/mol K) × (373.15 K) / (2 atm) = 15.34 L/mol\n\nNow, we can find the molar volume of the real gas (V_real/n) by dividing the given volume by the number of moles:\n\nV_real/n = 5 L / n\n\nFinally, we can calculate the compressibility factor (Z) by dividing the molar volume of the real gas by the molar volume of the ideal gas:\n\nZ = (V_real/n) / (V_ideal/n) = (5 L / n) / (15.34 L/mol)\n\nZ = 5 / 15.34 = 0.326\n\nThe compressibility factor of the gas mixture is approximately 0.326. This value is less than 1, which indicates that the gas mixture is more compressible than an ideal gas under the given conditions."
