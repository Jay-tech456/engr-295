    "message_2": "The expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos at Earth's surface depends on the energy range considered. Neutrinos are produced in astrophysical sources such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts, as well as through interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium.\n\nFor high-energy neutrinos in the range of 10^14 eV to 10^18 eV, the flux is estimated to be around 10^-18 to 10^-16 GeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1. This estimation is based on the IceCube Neutrino Observatory's measurements, which is a neutrino detector located at the South Pole.\n\nIn comparison, the flux of other cosmic particles, such as protons and photons, is much higher. The flux of cosmic ray protons with energies above 10^18 eV is about 10^-14 GeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1. The flux of cosmic ray photons (gamma rays) with energies above 10^9 eV is around 10^-8 GeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1.\n\nThe lower flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos compared to protons and photons is due to their weakly interacting nature. Neutrinos can pass through large amounts of matter without interacting, making them more difficult to detect. However, this property also allows neutrinos to provide unique information about distant astrophysical sources and the processes occurring within them, as they are not significantly absorbed or deflected during their journey to Earth."
