    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence for a light ray traveling from water into air, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (water), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (air), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. At the critical angle, the angle of refraction is 90 degrees.\n\nGiven the refractive index of water (n1) is 1.33 and the refractive index of air (n2) is 1.00, we can plug these values into Snell's Law:\n\n1.33 * sin(θ1) = 1.00 * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.33 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle of incidence (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.33\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.33)\n\nθ1 ≈ 48.8 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for a light ray traveling from water into air is approximately 48.8 degrees."
