    "message_2": "The fine structure constant, α, is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles. Its value is approximately 1/137.036, but it can be calculated more precisely using quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the method of renormalization.\n\nIn QED, the fine structure constant is calculated using perturbation theory, where the interaction between charged particles is represented as a series of terms that become progressively smaller as the order of perturbation increases. The method of renormalization is used to remove the infinities that arise in these calculations.\n\nWhen calculated to the third order of perturbation theory (also known as the three-loop level), the fine structure constant α can be expressed as:\n\nα = α₀ + α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + ...\n\nwhere α₀ is the zeroth-order (or \"bare\") value of the constant, and α₁, α₂, α₃, ... are the first, second, third, etc. order corrections.\n\nThe precise values of these corrections depend on the specific renormalization scheme used and are beyond the scope of a simple answer. However, the general result is that the fine structure constant becomes more accurate as higher-order corrections are included.\n\nIn practice, the value of the fine structure constant is often determined experimentally, and the most recent CODATA recommended value is:\n\nα ≈ 1/137.035999084(21)\n\nThis value includes contributions from higher-order corrections in QED, as well as other effects such as the weak and strong nuclear forces."
