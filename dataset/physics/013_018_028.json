    "message_2": "The average annual dose of cosmic ray background radiation received by an astronaut in space is about 50-200 millisieverts (mSv) per year, depending on factors such as solar activity and the specific location in space. This is significantly higher than the dose received by a person on Earth, which is approximately 2.4 mSv per year from all sources of natural background radiation, including cosmic rays.\n\nThe increased exposure to cosmic rays in space is primarily due to the lack of Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetic field, which shield us from a significant portion of this radiation. For comparison, the dose received by an astronaut in space can be up to 100 times greater than that received by a person on Earth.\n\nThe potential long-term health effects of this level of exposure to cosmic ray radiation are not yet fully understood, but they are a significant concern for long-duration space missions, such as a mission to Mars. Some of the known risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation include an increased risk of cancer, damage to the central nervous system, cataracts, and potential harm to the cardiovascular system.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, space agencies like NASA are researching ways to protect astronauts from cosmic rays, such as developing advanced shielding materials and studying the potential use of pharmaceutical countermeasures. Additionally, understanding the biological effects of cosmic rays and developing strategies to minimize their impact on human health are important areas of ongoing research in space medicine."
