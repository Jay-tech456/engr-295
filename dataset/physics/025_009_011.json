    "message_2": "The perception of pitch and loudness in humans is directly related to the frequency and amplitude of sound waves, respectively.\n\n1. Frequency and Pitch:\nFrequency refers to the number of cycles a sound wave completes in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). In terms of human perception, frequency corresponds to the pitch of a sound. Higher frequency sound waves are perceived as higher pitched sounds, while lower frequency sound waves are perceived as lower pitched sounds. The human ear can typically detect frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. However, our sensitivity to different frequencies varies, with the most sensitive range being between 2,000 Hz and 4,000 Hz.\n\n2. Amplitude and Loudness:\nAmplitude refers to the maximum displacement of a sound wave from its equilibrium position. In terms of human perception, amplitude corresponds to the loudness of a sound. Greater amplitude sound waves are perceived as louder sounds, while smaller amplitude sound waves are perceived as quieter sounds. Loudness is measured in decibels (dB), which is a logarithmic scale. This means that an increase of 10 dB corresponds to a tenfold increase in sound intensity.\n\nIn summary, the frequency of a sound wave affects the pitch we perceive, with higher frequencies corresponding to higher pitches and lower frequencies corresponding to lower pitches. The amplitude of a sound wave affects the loudness we perceive, with greater amplitudes corresponding to louder sounds and smaller amplitudes corresponding to quieter sounds."
