    "message_1": "A circular disc with a radius of 0.1m is carrying a current of 3A. Calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, which is perpendicular to its plane and located at a distance of 0.2m from the center of the disc. (Assume the disc is infinitely thin and the permeability constant of free space is 4π × 10^−7 T⋅m/A.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability constant of free space (4π × 10^−7 T⋅m/A), I is the current (3A), R is the radius of the disc (0.1m), and x is the distance from the center of the disc (0.2m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^−7 T⋅m/A * 3A * (0.1m)²) / (2 * ((0.1m)² + (0.2m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^−7 T⋅m/A * 3A * 0.01m²) / (2 * (0.01m² + 0.04m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (12π × 10^−7 T⋅m²) / (2 * (0.05m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (12π × 10^−7 T⋅m²) / (2 * 0.01118033989m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.69 × 10^−5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the disc, perpendicular to its plane, and located at a distance of 0.2m from the center of the disc is approximately 1.69 × 10^−5 T."
