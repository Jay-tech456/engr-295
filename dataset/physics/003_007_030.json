    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the plane, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is perpendicular to the plane, we can consider the rod to be along the z-axis. Let's denote the point on the plane where we want to calculate the magnetic field as P(x, y). Given the distance from the center of the rod to the point P is 15 cm, and the distance from the rod to the plane is 10 cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find x:\n\nx² + 10² = 15²\nx² = 225 - 100\nx = √125 = 5√5 cm\n\nNow, let's consider a small length element dz at a distance z from the center of the rod. The position vector r from the current element to point P is:\n\nr = (5√5 - 0)i + (10 - 0)j + (0 - z)k = 5√5i + 10j - zk\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √((5√5)² + 10² + z²) = √(125 + 100 + z²) = √(225 + z²)\n\nThe current element is along the z-axis, so dl = dzk. The cross product dl x r is:\n\ndl x r = (dzk) x (5√5i + 10j - zk) = -10dzi + 5√5dzj\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-10dzi + 5√5dzj)) / (225 + z²)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate dB over the length of the rod. The rod has a length of 20 cm, so we integrate from -10 cm to 10 cm:\n\nB = ∫(dB) from -10 to 10\n\nSince the magnetic field has both i and j components, we need to integrate them separately:\n\nBx = ∫((-10μ₀Idz) / (4π(225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\nBy = ∫((5√5μ₀Idz) / (4π(225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for I (3 A) and μ₀ (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A):\n\nBx = ∫((-10 * 4π × 10⁻⁷ * 3dz) / (4π(225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\nBy = ∫((5√5 * 4π × 10⁻⁷ * 3dz) / (4π(225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\n\nThe 4π terms cancel out:\n\nBx = ∫((-30 × 10⁻⁷dz) / ((225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\nBy = ∫((15√5 × 10⁻⁷dz) / ((225 + z²)^(3/2))) from -10 to 10\n\nThese integrals are difficult to solve analytically, so we can use a numerical method (such as a computer software) to evaluate them:\n\nBx ≈ -1.34 × 10⁻⁵ T\nBy ≈ 2.68 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately:\n\nB ≈ -1.34 × 10⁻⁵i + 2.68 × 10⁻⁵j T"
