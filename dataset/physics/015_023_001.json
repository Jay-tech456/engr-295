    "message_2": "The expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) depends on several factors, including the masses of the black holes, their orbital parameters, and the rate at which they merge. IMBHs are typically defined as having masses between 100 and 10^5 solar masses.\n\nGravitational waves from IMBHs are primarily generated during the inspiral and merger of binary systems. The frequency of these waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * M_chirp)^(5/8) * (pi * (1+z))^(3/8) / (8 * pi)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system (a combination of the two black hole masses), z is the redshift, and pi is the mathematical constant.\n\nFor IMBHs, the frequency of gravitational waves typically falls in the range of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. However, the exact frequency depends on the specific masses and orbital parameters of the black holes involved.\n\nThe optimal detection strategy for these gravitational waves involves using a combination of ground-based and space-based detectors. Ground-based detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are sensitive to higher-frequency gravitational waves (above 10 Hz) and can detect mergers involving smaller black holes. However, their sensitivity decreases at lower frequencies due to seismic noise and other factors.\n\nSpace-based detectors, such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are designed to be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves (between 0.1 mHz and 1 Hz). LISA will be particularly well-suited for detecting gravitational waves from IMBH mergers, as its sensitivity range overlaps with the expected frequency range of these events.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted from a population of intermediate-mass black holes is in the range of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. The optimal detection strategy for these waves involves using a combination of ground-based and space-based detectors, with space-based detectors like LISA being particularly well-suited for detecting IMBH mergers."
