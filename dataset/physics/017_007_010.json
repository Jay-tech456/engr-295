    "message_2": "Topological insulators and topological semimetals are both classes of materials that exhibit unique electronic and optical properties due to their topological nature. However, there are some key differences between them:\n\n1. Electronic band structure: Topological insulators have a bandgap in their electronic band structure, which means that there is an energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. In contrast, topological semimetals have their valence and conduction bands touching at discrete points or along lines, leading to the formation of Dirac or Weyl nodes.\n\n2. Surface states: Topological insulators are characterized by insulating bulk states and conducting surface states. These surface states are protected by time-reversal symmetry, which makes them robust against disorder and impurities. On the other hand, topological semimetals exhibit bulk states with linear energy dispersion near the Dirac or Weyl nodes, leading to unique transport properties.\n\n3. Spin-momentum locking: In topological insulators, the spin of the electrons in the surface states is locked to their momentum, resulting in a helical spin texture. This property can be exploited for spintronics applications. Topological semimetals, however, do not exhibit such spin-momentum locking.\n\nReal-world applications of topological insulators and topological semimetals in modern electronics and photonics devices include:\n\n1. Spintronics: Topological insulators can be used in spintronic devices, where the manipulation of electron spin is used for information processing and storage. The spin-momentum locking property of topological insulators can be exploited to generate and manipulate spin currents without the need for external magnetic fields.\n\n2. Quantum computing: Topological insulators can host Majorana fermions, which are exotic particles that can be used as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These particles are immune to local perturbations, making them ideal for stable quantum bits (qubits).\n\n3. Optoelectronics: Topological semimetals can exhibit strong nonlinear optical responses, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic devices such as frequency converters, optical switches, and photodetectors.\n\n4. Thermoelectric devices: Both topological insulators and topological semimetals can exhibit high thermoelectric performance due to their unique electronic structures. These materials can be used in thermoelectric devices for waste heat recovery and energy conversion.\n\n5. Superconductivity: Some topological semimetals can exhibit unconventional superconductivity, which can be used for developing novel superconducting devices with enhanced performance and unique functionalities.\n\nIn summary, topological insulators and topological semimetals are distinct classes of materials with unique electronic and optical properties. Their potential applications in modern electronics and photonics devices are vast, ranging from spintronics and quantum computing to optoelectronics and thermoelectric devices."
