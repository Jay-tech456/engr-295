    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of energy released in the form of gravitational waves by the supernova explosion. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The explosion released 1% of its mass in gravitational waves.\n2. The initial mass of the core was 15 times that of the sun.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass released in gravitational waves:\n\nMass of the core = 15 * Mass of the sun\nMass of the sun ≈ 1.989 × 10^30 kg (using the standard solar mass)\n\nMass of the core ≈ 15 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg ≈ 2.9835 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, let's find the mass released in gravitational waves:\n\nMass released in gravitational waves = 0.01 * Mass of the core\nMass released in gravitational waves ≈ 0.01 * 2.9835 × 10^31 kg ≈ 2.9835 × 10^29 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, to find the energy released in gravitational waves:\n\nE = mc^2\nwhere\nE = energy released in gravitational waves\nm = mass released in gravitational waves\nc = speed of light ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nE = (2.9835 × 10^29 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 2.9835 × 10^29 kg * 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE ≈ 2.68515 × 10^46 Joules\n\nSo, the total amount of energy released in the form of gravitational waves by the supernova explosion is approximately 2.68515 × 10^46 Joules."
