    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the specific heat capacity of a gas mixture consisting of 20% methane, 30% ethane, 40% propane, and 10% butane, given the mass and temperature of the mixture.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture, we need to find the weighted average of the specific heat capacities of each individual gas component. The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the substance by one degree Celsius.\n\nFirst, let's find the specific heat capacities (Cp) of each gas component at constant pressure:\n\n1. Methane (CH4): Cp = 2.20 J/g°C\n2. Ethane (C2H6): Cp = 2.44 J/g°C\n3. Propane (C3H8): Cp = 2.94 J/g°C\n4. Butane (C4H10): Cp = 3.24 J/g°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the weighted average specific heat capacity of the gas mixture using the given percentages:\n\nCp_mixture = (0.20 * Cp_methane) + (0.30 * Cp_ethane) + (0.40 * Cp_propane) + (0.10 * Cp_butane)\n\nCp_mixture = (0.20 * 2.20 J/g°C) + (0.30 * 2.44 J/g°C) + (0.40 * 2.94 J/g°C) + (0.10 * 3.24 J/g°C)\n\nCp_mixture = 0.44 J/g°C + 0.732 J/g°C + 1.176 J/g°C + 0.324 J/g°C\n\nCp_mixture ≈ 2.67 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture is approximately 2.67 J/g°C."
