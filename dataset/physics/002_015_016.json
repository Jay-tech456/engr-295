    "message_1": "An air-source heat pump has an outdoor temperature of -10°C and an indoor temperature of 25°C. The heat pump absorbs 20 kJ of heat from the outdoor air per second and expels 35 kJ of heat to the indoor air per second. Calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the useful heat output (Q_in) to the work input (W) required to transfer the heat. In this case, the heat pump absorbs 20 kJ of heat from the outdoor air (Q_out) and expels 35 kJ of heat to the indoor air (Q_in) per second.\n\nCOP = Q_in / W\n\nWe know that the heat pump expels 35 kJ of heat to the indoor air per second (Q_in), but we need to find the work input (W). We can use the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total energy input equals the total energy output:\n\nQ_in = Q_out + W\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for W:\n\nW = Q_in - Q_out\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nW = 35 kJ - 20 kJ = 15 kJ\n\nNow we can calculate the COP:\n\nCOP = Q_in / W = 35 kJ / 15 kJ = 2.33\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is 2.33."
