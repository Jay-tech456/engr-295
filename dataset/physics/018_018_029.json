    "message_2": "The critical energy density required to create and observe the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions is typically in the range of 1 to 10 GeV/fmÂ³ (giga-electron volts per cubic femtometer). This value is derived from lattice QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) calculations and experimental observations at facilities such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The exact value may vary depending on the specific conditions and assumptions made in the calculations."
