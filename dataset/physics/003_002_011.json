    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength inside a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of solenoid\n\nGiven that the solenoid has 500 turns and a length of 30 cm (0.3 m), we can calculate n:\n\nn = 500 turns / 0.3 m = 1666.67 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength (B) using the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A, n = 1666.67 turns/m, and I = 2 A:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (1666.67 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB ≈ 4.19 × 10⁻³ T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a point inside the solenoid, located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the solenoid, is approximately 4.19 × 10⁻³ T (tesla)."
