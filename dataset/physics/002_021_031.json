    "message_1": "A tank contains a mixture of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 5 atm. Determine the fugacity of nitrogen gas if its mole fraction in the mixture is 0.4. The vapor pressure of pure nitrogen at 300 K is 0.9 atm, and that of hydrogen is negligible.",
    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of nitrogen gas in the mixture, we can use the following equation:\n\nfugacity = mole fraction * fugacity coefficient * pressure\n\nThe fugacity coefficient (phi) can be calculated using the Lewis-Randall rule, which states that the fugacity coefficient of a component in a mixture is equal to the fugacity coefficient of the pure component at the same temperature and pressure. For ideal gases, the fugacity coefficient is approximately equal to 1.\n\nSince the vapor pressure of hydrogen is negligible, we can assume that the fugacity coefficient of nitrogen in the mixture is approximately equal to the fugacity coefficient of pure nitrogen at the same temperature and pressure. Therefore, the fugacity coefficient (phi) for nitrogen is approximately 1.\n\nNow we can calculate the fugacity of nitrogen gas in the mixture:\n\nfugacity = mole fraction * fugacity coefficient * pressure\nfugacity = 0.4 * 1 * 5 atm\nfugacity = 2 atm\n\nThe fugacity of nitrogen gas in the mixture is approximately 2 atm."
