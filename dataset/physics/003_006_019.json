    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 m from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), R is the radius of the coil (0.1 m), and x is the distance from the center of the coil (0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * 0.02795084971 m³)\n\nB ≈ 0.0000006283185307 T / 0.05590169942 m³\n\nB ≈ 0.000011244 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 m from the center of the coil is approximately 1.124 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
