    "message_2": "To find the scattering angle, we can use Bragg's law, which is given by:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer (the order of reflection), λ is the wavelength of the neutrons, d is the lattice spacing, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nn = 1 (we'll consider the first-order reflection)\nλ = 1.5 Å\nd = 2.8 Å\n\nWe can rearrange Bragg's law to solve for θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(nλ / 2d)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nθ = arcsin(1 * 1.5 Å / (2 * 2.8 Å))\n\nθ = arcsin(0.267857)\n\nθ ≈ 15.6°\n\nSo, the scattering angle of neutrons with a wavelength of 1.5 Å when they are incident on a sample with a lattice spacing of 2.8 Å in the (100) direction is approximately 15.6°."
