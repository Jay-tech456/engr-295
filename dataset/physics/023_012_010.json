    "message_2": "Topological qubits in a quantum computer can be protected from external disturbances and maintain their quantum coherence during operation through several techniques:\n\n1. Topological error correction: Topological qubits are inherently more robust against local errors due to their non-local encoding of quantum information. By using topological error-correcting codes, such as the surface code or the toric code, quantum information can be stored and processed in a fault-tolerant manner, making the system less susceptible to errors caused by external disturbances.\n\n2. Cryogenic cooling: Operating the quantum computer at extremely low temperatures (in the millikelvin range) can help reduce thermal noise and other environmental disturbances. This helps maintain the quantum coherence of the topological qubits during operation.\n\n3. Shielding: To protect the quantum computer from external electromagnetic interference, the system can be enclosed in a shielded environment, such as a Faraday cage or a superconducting shield. This prevents external electromagnetic fields from affecting the qubits and causing decoherence.\n\n4. Vibration isolation: Mechanical vibrations can also cause decoherence in topological qubits. To minimize this effect, the quantum computer can be placed on a vibration isolation platform or mounted on a vibration-damping structure.\n\n5. Error detection and correction: Implementing real-time error detection and correction techniques can help maintain the quantum coherence of topological qubits during operation. Quantum error correction codes, such as the Steane code or the Shor code, can be used to detect and correct errors that occur during the computation process.\n\n6. Optimal control techniques: By carefully designing the control pulses used to manipulate the qubits, one can minimize the effects of external disturbances on the quantum system. This can be achieved through techniques such as composite pulse sequences, dynamic decoupling, and optimal control theory.\n\nIn summary, protecting topological qubits in a quantum computer from external disturbances and maintaining their quantum coherence during operation can be achieved through a combination of topological error correction, cryogenic cooling, shielding, vibration isolation, error detection and correction, and optimal control techniques."
