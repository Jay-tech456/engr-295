    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point. This is due to the fact that rays passing through the outer edges of the lens are refracted more than those passing through the center. As a result, the image formed by a lens with spherical aberration will be blurred.\n\nTo determine the shape and size of the blurred image, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is when the rays passing through the outer edges of the lens converge at a different point than those passing through the center. In this case, the shape of the blurred image will be a circle, with the diameter of the circle being the maximum difference in convergence points between the outer and central rays.\n\nTo calculate the size of the blurred image, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. However, we do not have enough information about the lens material and the radii of curvature to calculate the focal length directly.\n\nInstead, we can use the thin lens formula to estimate the focal length:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere u is the object distance (30 cm), and v is the image distance. Since we don't have the image distance, we cannot calculate the focal length directly.\n\nHowever, we can provide a qualitative description of the blurred image. The shape of the blurred image will be circular, and the size of the circle will depend on the severity of the spherical aberration. The larger the difference in convergence points between the outer and central rays, the larger the diameter of the blurred circle.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the lens material and the radii of curvature, we cannot calculate the exact size of the blurred image or the focal length of the lens. However, we can say that the shape of the blurred image will be a circle, and the size of the circle will depend on the severity of the spherical aberration."
