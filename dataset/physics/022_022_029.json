    "message_2": "The expected distribution of dark matter composed of dark atoms or molecules in a galaxy is typically modeled as a halo surrounding the visible matter. This dark matter halo is thought to have a roughly spherical shape, with the density decreasing as you move away from the center of the galaxy. The distribution can be described by various density profiles, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile or the Einasto profile.\n\nDark matter affects the observed gravitational lensing of distant objects because its mass contributes to the overall gravitational potential of the galaxy. Gravitational lensing occurs when the light from a distant object, such as a galaxy or quasar, is bent as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, like a galaxy or galaxy cluster, that lies between the distant object and the observer.\n\nThe presence of dark matter in a galaxy increases the total mass of the galaxy, which in turn increases the strength of its gravitational field. This means that the gravitational lensing effect will be stronger for a galaxy with a significant amount of dark matter compared to a galaxy with little or no dark matter. Observations of gravitational lensing can therefore provide indirect evidence for the existence and distribution of dark matter in galaxies.\n\nBy studying the gravitational lensing effects of distant objects, astronomers can gain insights into the distribution and properties of dark matter in galaxies. This information can help improve our understanding of the nature of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies."
