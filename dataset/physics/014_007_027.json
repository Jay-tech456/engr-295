    "message_2": "The large-scale structure of the universe, including the cosmic web, is closely related to the composition and distribution of dark matter. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, and its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter.\n\nThe cosmic web is the large-scale structure of the universe, consisting of galaxy clusters and filaments interconnected by vast cosmic voids. This structure is thought to have formed through the gravitational interaction of dark matter and baryonic (ordinary) matter.\n\nCurrent observations and theoretical models from cosmology, such as the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model, provide insights into the relationship between the cosmic web and dark matter. The ΛCDM model is the leading cosmological model that describes the large-scale structure of the universe, incorporating dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter.\n\nAccording to the ΛCDM model, the universe began with a nearly uniform distribution of dark matter and baryonic matter. As the universe expanded and cooled, small fluctuations in the density of matter began to grow under the influence of gravity. Dark matter, being more massive and less influenced by radiation pressure, began to clump together first, forming a gravitational scaffold for the baryonic matter to follow.\n\nOver time, these clumps of dark matter grew larger and more massive, attracting more baryonic matter and forming the seeds of galaxy clusters and filaments. The gravitational interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter led to the formation of the cosmic web, with dark matter providing the underlying structure that holds the web together.\n\nObservations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and gravitational lensing effects support the ΛCDM model and the role of dark matter in shaping the cosmic web. Gravitational lensing, in particular, allows astronomers to map the distribution of dark matter by observing how the path of light from distant galaxies is bent by the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as dark matter halos.\n\nIn summary, the large-scale structure of the universe, including the cosmic web, is closely related to the composition and distribution of dark matter. Theoretical models like the ΛCDM model, along with observations of the CMB, galaxy distribution, and gravitational lensing, suggest that dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of the cosmic web. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffold for the baryonic matter to follow, shaping the interconnected network of galaxy clusters and filaments that make up the cosmic web."
