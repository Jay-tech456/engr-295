    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point 3 cm away from the central axis of the capacitor, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the geometry of the problem is simple, we can use Ampere's law instead. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's convert the given dimensions to meters:\n\nPlate separation: 2 cm = 0.02 m\nPlate area: 100 cm² = 0.01 m²\nDistance from the central axis: 3 cm = 0.03 m\n\nNow, let's consider an Amperian loop in the form of a rectangle with one side parallel to the plates and the other side perpendicular to the plates. The loop should have a width of 0.03 m (the distance from the central axis) and a height of 0.02 m (the plate separation). The total current enclosed by this loop is 2 A.\n\nWe can now apply Ampere's law to this loop. Since the magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the sides of the loop, the line integral of B⋅dl can be simplified as:\n\nB * (perimeter of the loop) = μ₀ * I\n\nThe perimeter of the loop is 2 * (0.03 + 0.02) = 0.1 m. The permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB * 0.1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1\nB ≈ 2.513 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing from the positive plate to the negative plate, the magnetic field will be circulating around the current in a clockwise direction when viewed from above. At the point 3 cm away from the central axis, the magnetic field will be pointing into the plane of the capacitor.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 3 cm away from the central axis of the capacitor is approximately 2.513 × 10^(-5) T, and its direction is into the plane of the capacitor."
