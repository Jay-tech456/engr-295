    "message_2": "To calculate the radiation level at a distance of 2 meters from a ^60Co source emitting 5 mCi of activity, we can use the inverse-square law. The inverse-square law states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the activity of the source from millicuries (mCi) to Becquerels (Bq). 1 mCi is equal to 3.7 x 10^7 Bq.\n\nActivity (A) = 5 mCi * (3.7 x 10^7 Bq/mCi) = 1.85 x 10^8 Bq\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the inverse-square law:\n\nI = A / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere I is the radiation intensity, A is the activity of the source, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nI = (1.85 x 10^8 Bq) / (4 * π * (2 m)^2)\nI = (1.85 x 10^8 Bq) / (4 * π * 4 m^2)\nI = (1.85 x 10^8 Bq) / (16 * π m^2)\nI ≈ (1.85 x 10^8 Bq) / (50.27 m^2)\nI ≈ 3.68 x 10^6 Bq/m^2\n\nSo, the radiation level at a distance of 2 meters from the ^60Co source is approximately 3.68 x 10^6 Bq/m^2."
