    "message_2": "To calculate the beta function for the scalar φ^4 theory in two-dimensional space-time, we will use the renormalization group method in quantum field theory. The Lagrangian density for the φ^4 theory is given by:\n\nL = (∂_μφ)(∂^μφ)/2 - m^2φ^2/2 - λφ^4/4!\n\nHere, m is the mass, λ is the coupling constant, and φ is the scalar field.\n\nThe renormalization group equation (RGE) for the coupling constant λ is given by:\n\ndλ/d(log μ) = β(λ)\n\nwhere μ is the renormalization scale, and β(λ) is the beta function we want to calculate.\n\nTo find the beta function, we need to compute the one-loop correction to the φ^4 vertex. In two-dimensional space-time, the one-loop correction diagram is a tadpole diagram, which is given by:\n\nΓ_1-loop = (-iλ) * (i/2π) * ∫ d^2k/(2π)^2 * 1/(k^2 + m^2)\n\nNow, we need to regularize the integral using a momentum cutoff Λ:\n\nΓ_1-loop = (-iλ) * (i/2π) * ∫_0^Λ d^2k/(2π)^2 * 1/(k^2 + m^2)\n\nThis integral can be computed as:\n\nΓ_1-loop = (-iλ) * (i/2π) * (1/2π) * ∫_0^Λ dk * k/(k^2 + m^2)\n\nΓ_1-loop = (-iλ) * (i/4π^2) * [log(k^2 + m^2)]_0^Λ\n\nΓ_1-loop = (-iλ) * (i/4π^2) * log(Λ^2 + m^2)\n\nNow, we can find the renormalized coupling constant λ_R:\n\nλ_R = λ + Γ_1-loop\n\nλ_R = λ - (λ/4π^2) * log(Λ^2 + m^2)\n\nNow, we can differentiate λ_R with respect to log μ:\n\ndλ_R/d(log μ) = dλ/d(log μ) - (λ/4π^2) * d(log(Λ^2 + m^2))/d(log μ)\n\nSince dλ_R/d(log μ) = 0 (as λ_R is scale-independent), we have:\n\nβ(λ) = (λ/4π^2) * d(log(Λ^2 + m^2))/d(log μ)\n\nTo find the beta function, we need to compute the derivative of log(Λ^2 + m^2) with respect to log μ. However, this derivative depends on the specific renormalization scheme used. In general, the beta function for the φ^4 theory in two-dimensional space-time will have the form:\n\nβ(λ) = (λ/4π^2) * C\n\nwhere C is a constant that depends on the renormalization scheme."
