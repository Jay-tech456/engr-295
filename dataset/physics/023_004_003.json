How does this probability change if the bit error rate is increased to 5%? How can the system's security be improved to reduce the probability of eavesdropping?",
    "message_2": "In a quantum key distribution (QKD) system using the BB84 protocol, the probability of eavesdropping can be estimated by analyzing the bit error rate (BER) in the transmitted qubits. The BER is the percentage of bits that have errors due to noise, interference, or eavesdropping attempts.\n\nLet's first consider the case when the bit error rate is 1%. In the BB84 protocol, Alice and Bob randomly choose between two bases (rectilinear and diagonal) to prepare and measure qubits. If an eavesdropper (Eve) intercepts a qubit, she also has to randomly choose a basis to measure it. If she chooses the correct basis, she won't introduce any error, but if she chooses the wrong basis, she will introduce an error with a probability of 50%. Therefore, if the BER is 1%, it can be assumed that Eve introduces errors in 2% of the intercepted qubits (since half of the errors are due to other factors like noise and interference).\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the bit error rate is increased to 5%. Following the same logic, it can be assumed that Eve introduces errors in 10% of the intercepted qubits.\n\nTo improve the system's security and reduce the probability of eavesdropping, several techniques can be employed:\n\n1. Error correction and privacy amplification: Alice and Bob can use error correction codes to detect and correct errors in the transmitted qubits. After error correction, they can use privacy amplification techniques to shorten the key, reducing the information leaked to Eve.\n\n2. Improved hardware and channel quality: By using better hardware components (e.g., higher quality photon sources and detectors) and improving the quality of the quantum channel (e.g., reducing noise and interference), the overall BER can be reduced, making it more difficult for Eve to eavesdrop without being detected.\n\n3. Decoy states: Alice can send additional decoy states (qubits with different intensities) along with the actual qubits. By monitoring the error rates in these decoy states, Alice and Bob can estimate the presence of an eavesdropper more accurately.\n\n4. Monitoring the channel: Continuously monitoring the quantum channel for any physical tampering or unusual activity can help in detecting eavesdropping attempts.\n\nBy employing these techniques, the security of a QKD system using the BB84 protocol can be improved, making it more resistant to eavesdropping attempts."
