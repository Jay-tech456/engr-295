    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observed gravitational lensing effect of a galaxy cluster. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy. This bending of light is due to the gravitational influence of the massive object, which causes the space-time around it to curve, following the predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, but it does have mass and therefore exerts a gravitational force. It is estimated that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (the stuff we can see) makes up only about 5%. The presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters increases their total mass, which in turn enhances their gravitational lensing effect.\n\nThe study of gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters can provide valuable information about the distribution and behavior of dark matter in the universe. By analyzing the lensing effect, astronomers can map the distribution of mass within the galaxy cluster, including both visible and dark matter. This allows them to estimate the amount of dark matter present and determine its spatial distribution within the cluster.\n\nFurthermore, the observed gravitational lensing effect can be used to test different models and theories of dark matter. For example, if a particular dark matter model predicts a specific distribution of mass within a galaxy cluster, this can be compared to the actual distribution inferred from gravitational lensing observations. If the model's predictions match the observations, it provides support for that particular dark matter model.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters significantly affects the observed gravitational lensing effect by increasing the total mass of the cluster and enhancing the bending of light. Studying this lensing effect allows astronomers to probe the distribution and behavior of dark matter in the universe, providing crucial insights into its nature and helping to test different dark matter models and theories."
