    "message_2": "The presence of disorder in glasses has a significant impact on their thermal conductivity. In general, glasses have lower thermal conductivity compared to their crystalline counterparts due to the disordered nature of their atomic structure. This disorder can be attributed to the amorphous arrangement of atoms and the lack of long-range order in glasses. The effect of disorder on thermal conductivity in glasses can be explained through the following factors:\n\n1. Phonon scattering: In crystalline materials, heat is primarily conducted through lattice vibrations known as phonons. In glasses, the disordered atomic structure leads to a higher degree of phonon scattering, which reduces the mean free path of phonons and, consequently, the thermal conductivity. The presence of disorder in glasses causes the phonons to scatter more frequently, reducing their ability to transport heat effectively.\n\n2. Reduced phonon group velocity: The disordered structure of glasses also affects the group velocity of phonons, which is the speed at which energy is transported by phonons. In a disordered material like glass, the group velocity of phonons is generally lower than in a crystalline material, leading to a decrease in thermal conductivity.\n\n3. Localized vibrations: In glasses, the presence of disorder can lead to localized vibrations, which are confined to specific regions within the material. These localized vibrations do not contribute to heat transport and can further reduce the overall thermal conductivity of the glass.\n\n4. Impurities and defects: The presence of impurities and defects in glasses can also contribute to the reduction in thermal conductivity. These impurities and defects can act as additional scattering centers for phonons, further reducing their mean free path and the material's ability to conduct heat.\n\nIn summary, the presence of disorder in glasses significantly affects their thermal conductivity by increasing phonon scattering, reducing phonon group velocity, promoting localized vibrations, and introducing impurities and defects. These factors collectively lead to a lower thermal conductivity in glasses compared to their crystalline counterparts."
