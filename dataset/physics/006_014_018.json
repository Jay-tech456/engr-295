    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state (n=2) of a hydrogen atom, we need to determine the transition rate between the excited state and the ground state (n=1). The transition rate can be calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule, which states that the transition rate (Γ) is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian (|H'|²) and the density of final states (ρ(E)).\n\nΓ = (2π/ħ) |H'|² ρ(E)\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the interaction Hamiltonian can be approximated by the electric dipole interaction between the electron and the nucleus. The matrix element of the electric dipole interaction can be written as:\n\n|H'| = e |<ψ2|z|ψ1>|,\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, ψ1 and ψ2 are the wavefunctions of the ground state and the first excited state, respectively, and z is the position operator.\n\nThe density of final states can be calculated as:\n\nρ(E) = (2J_f + 1) / (2J_i + 1),\n\nwhere J_i and J_f are the initial and final angular momenta, respectively. For a hydrogen atom, J_i = J_f = 1/2, so ρ(E) = 1.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the matrix element |<ψ2|z|ψ1>|. For a hydrogen atom, the wavefunctions can be written as:\n\nψ1 = (1/√π) a₀^(-3/2) exp(-r/a₀),\nψ2 = (1/√(8π)) a₀^(-3/2) (1 - r/(2a₀)) exp(-r/(2a₀)),\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 5.29 x 10^(-11) m).\n\nThe matrix element can be calculated as:\n\n|<ψ2|z|ψ1>| = ∫∫∫ ψ2*(r) z ψ1(r) r² dr sinθ dθ dφ,\n\nwhere the integration is over all space (r: 0 to ∞, θ: 0 to π, φ: 0 to 2π).\n\nAfter calculating the integral, we get:\n\n|<ψ2|z|ψ1>| ≈ (3/2) a₀.\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition rate:\n\nΓ = (2π/ħ) e² (3/2)² a₀².\n\nUsing the values e ≈ 1.6 x 10^(-19) C, ħ ≈ 1.05 x 10^(-34) Js, and a₀ ≈ 5.29 x 10^(-11) m, we get:\n\nΓ ≈ 6.25 x 10^15 s^(-1).\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of the first excited state is the inverse of the transition rate:\n\nτ = 1/Γ ≈ 1.6 x 10^(-16) s.\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state (n=2) of a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.6 x 10^(-16) seconds."
