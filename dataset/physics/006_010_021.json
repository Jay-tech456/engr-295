    "message_2": "To calculate the expected angle of deflection for an alpha particle incident on a gold nucleus, we can use the formula derived from Rutherford's scattering experiment:\n\nθ = 2 * arctan(Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (4 * π * ε₀ * K * b))\n\nwhere:\nθ is the scattering angle,\nZ₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the two interacting particles (Z₁ = 2 for an alpha particle, Z₂ = 79 for gold),\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C),\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²),\nK is the kinetic energy of the incident particle (5.0 MeV = 5.0 × 10⁶ eV = 5.0 × 10⁶ × 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J), and\nb is the impact parameter.\n\nHowever, we cannot calculate the exact angle of deflection without knowing the impact parameter (b). The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance between the path of the incident particle and the center of the target nucleus. The angle of deflection depends on the impact parameter, with larger impact parameters resulting in smaller deflection angles.\n\nIf you provide the impact parameter, we can calculate the expected angle of deflection."
