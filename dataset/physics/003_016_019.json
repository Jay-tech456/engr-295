    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the triangle, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, we can divide it into three equal parts and calculate the magnetic field due to one side and then multiply it by 3 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's first find the height (h) of the equilateral triangle using Pythagorean theorem:\n\nh = √(a² - (a/2)²) = √(0.2² - (0.2/2)²) = √(0.04 - 0.01) = √0.03 m\n\nwhere a is the length of one side of the triangle (0.2 m).\n\nNow, let's find the distance (d) from the midpoint of one side to the center of the triangle:\n\nd = h/2 = √0.03/2 ≈ 0.12247 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the triangle. Let's consider an infinitesimal length dl on the side of the triangle. The angle between dl and r is 90 degrees (since the magnetic field is being calculated at the center of the triangle). The cross product of dl and r will have a magnitude of dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r, and the direction will be perpendicular to the plane formed by dl and r (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of the triangle).\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression along the length of one side of the triangle, we get:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dl / r²) = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (1 / d²) * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl along the side of the triangle is just the length of the side (0.2 m). So,\n\nB_side = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A / 4π) * (1 / 0.12247² m²) * 0.2 m ≈ 5.368 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince there are three sides, the total magnetic field at the center of the triangle is:\n\nB_total = 3 * B_side ≈ 3 * 5.368 × 10⁻⁶ T ≈ 16.104 × 10⁻⁶ T ≈ 16.1 μT\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane of the triangle and will be the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each side. Due to symmetry, the magnetic fields due to each side will have equal magnitudes and will be oriented in such a way that their vector sum points directly out of the plane of the triangle (either up or down, depending on the direction of the current).\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop is approximately 16.1 μT, and the direction is perpendicular to the plane of the triangle."
