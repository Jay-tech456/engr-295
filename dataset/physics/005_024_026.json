    "message_2": "To calculate the age of the universe using the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data, we need to use the current measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) and the cosmological parameters, such as the matter density (Ωm) and the dark energy density (ΩΛ). In this case, we are given a flat universe and a cosmological constant of 0.7.\n\nA flat universe implies that the total energy density (Ω) is equal to 1. Since we are given the cosmological constant (ΩΛ) as 0.7, we can determine the matter density (Ωm) as follows:\n\nΩm = 1 - ΩΛ = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\nNow, we need the Hubble constant (H0) to proceed. The current accepted value of the Hubble constant is approximately 67.4 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec). We need to convert this value to the units of inverse time (1/years) to calculate the age of the universe.\n\n1 Mpc = 3.086 × 10^19 km\n1 year = 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds\n\nH0 = 67.4 km/s/Mpc * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 km) * (3.1536 × 10^7 s / 1 year)\nH0 ≈ 2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can use the following formula to calculate the age of the universe (t):\n\nt = 1 / (3 * (1 - Ωm)^(1/2) * H0)\n\nt = 1 / (3 * (1 - 0.3)^(1/2) * 2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1)\n\nt ≈ 4.47 × 10^17 seconds\n\nNow, we convert the time to years:\n\nt ≈ 4.47 × 10^17 seconds * (1 year / 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds)\nt ≈ 14.17 billion years\n\nSo, the age of the universe calculated using the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation data is approximately 14.17 billion years."
