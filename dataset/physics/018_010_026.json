    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from various sources in the universe and have a wide range of energies. The primary sources of cosmic rays can be classified into three main categories: solar, galactic, and extragalactic.\n\n1. Solar cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from the Sun, particularly during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar cosmic rays are primarily low-energy particles, with energies ranging from a few kiloelectronvolts (keV) to several gigaelectronvolts (GeV). Due to their relatively low energies, solar cosmic rays are more easily deflected by the Earth's magnetic field and are less likely to reach the Earth's surface.\n\n2. Galactic cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from within our Milky Way galaxy, primarily from supernova explosions and the acceleration of particles in the shockwaves produced by these events. Galactic cosmic rays have a wide range of energies, typically from a few hundred MeV to several exaelectronvolts (EeV). The energy distribution of galactic cosmic rays is isotropic, meaning they arrive at Earth from all directions with no preferred direction.\n\n3. Extragalactic cosmic rays: These cosmic rays originate from sources outside our galaxy, such as active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and other powerful astrophysical phenomena. Extragalactic cosmic rays have the highest energies, ranging from a few EeV to beyond 100 EeV. Like galactic cosmic rays, their arrival directions are also isotropic.\n\nThe energies of cosmic rays vary with respect to their sources due to the different acceleration mechanisms and environments associated with each source. Solar cosmic rays have lower energies because they are accelerated by relatively weaker magnetic fields and lower-energy processes in the Sun. Galactic cosmic rays have higher energies because they are accelerated by the strong shockwaves produced by supernova explosions. Extragalactic cosmic rays have the highest energies because they are accelerated by the most extreme astrophysical processes in the universe.\n\nIn terms of arrival directions, solar cosmic rays are more likely to arrive from the direction of the Sun, while galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays have isotropic arrival directions due to their distant sources and the influence of magnetic fields in the interstellar and intergalactic medium, which scatter and randomize their trajectories."
