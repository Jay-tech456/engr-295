    "message_2": "To find the position and size of the image formed by a concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance from the mirror, and v is the image distance from the mirror.\n\nGiven, the focal length f = -5 cm (negative since it's a concave mirror), and the object distance u = -10 cm (negative since the object is placed on the same side as the mirror).\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-5) = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-5) - 1/(-10)\n1/v = (-10 + 5) / 50\n1/v = -5 / 50\nv = -50 / 5\nv = -10 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror, on the same side as the object (since v is negative).\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u = h'/h\n\nwhere h is the object height (size) and h' is the image height (size).\n\nSince the object is spherical with a radius of 3 cm, its height (diameter) is h = 2 * 3 = 6 cm.\n\nWe already found that v = -10 cm and u = -10 cm, so:\n\nm = -v/u = -(-10) / (-10) = 1\n\nNow we can find the image height (size) h':\n\nh' = m * h = 1 * 6 = 6 cm\n\nThe image formed is also spherical with a diameter of 6 cm, the same size as the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed 10 cm away from the mirror on the same side as the object, and the size of the image is the same as the object, with a diameter of 6 cm."
