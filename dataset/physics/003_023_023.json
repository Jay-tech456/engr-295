    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 2 m from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, r is the distance from the wire, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, for a straight, infinitely long wire, we can use Ampere's Law to simplify the calculation. The magnetic field B around a straight wire carrying a current I is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * r)\n\nGiven the current I = 5 A and the distance r = 2 m, we can calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 2 m)\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ T) / 4\nB = 5π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 2 m from the wire is approximately 1.57 × 10⁻⁶ T (Tesla)."
