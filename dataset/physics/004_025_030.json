    "message_2": "The frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of primordial black holes (PBHs) depends on the masses of the black holes involved and the specifics of the coalescence process. To estimate the frequency range, we can use the characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the final stages of the coalescence, known as the inspiral phase.\n\nThe characteristic frequency (f) of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * π * 8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes involved in the coalescence.\n\nPrimordial black holes are thought to have a wide range of masses, from as low as the Planck mass (~10^-8 kg) up to thousands of solar masses. However, the most likely mass range for PBHs that could contribute significantly to the dark matter density in the universe is between 10^-18 and 10^3 solar masses.\n\nTaking this mass range into account, we can estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of primordial black holes:\n\nFor the lower mass limit (10^-18 solar masses):\n\nf_low = (c^3) / (G * (2 * 10^-18 * M_sun) * π * 8) ≈ 10^11 Hz\n\nFor the upper mass limit (10^3 solar masses):\n\nf_high = (c^3) / (G * (2 * 10^3 * M_sun) * π * 8) ≈ 10^-4 Hz\n\nwhere M_sun is the solar mass (≈ 2 x 10^30 kg).\n\nSo, the predicted frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of primordial black holes is roughly between 10^-4 Hz and 10^11 Hz. However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency range could be different depending on the specifics of the coalescence process and the mass distribution of primordial black holes."
