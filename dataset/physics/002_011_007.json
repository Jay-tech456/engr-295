    "message_1": "A gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion from an initial volume of 0.5 m³ to a final volume of 2 m³. The initial pressure of the gas was 2 × 10⁵ Pa and the final pressure is 4 × 10⁴ Pa. Calculate the work done by the gas during the process.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion, we can use the following formula:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index or the ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv).\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of γ. For an ideal diatomic gas (like oxygen or nitrogen, which are the main components of air), γ is approximately 1.4. If the gas is not specified, we can assume it's an ideal diatomic gas.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values into the formula:\n\nW = ((2 × 10⁵ Pa) * (0.5 m³) - (4 × 10⁴ Pa) * (2 m³)) / (1.4 - 1)\n\nW = (1 × 10⁵ m³*Pa - 8 × 10⁴ m³*Pa) / 0.4\n\nW = (2 × 10⁴ m³*Pa) / 0.4\n\nW = 5 × 10⁴ J\n\nThe work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion is 50,000 Joules."
