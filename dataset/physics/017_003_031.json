    "message_2": "The optical conductivity of graphene is influenced by the level of doping, which refers to the intentional introduction of impurities into the material to modify its electronic properties. Doping can either increase the number of charge carriers (electrons or holes) or change their mobility. In the case of graphene, the optical conductivity is primarily determined by the number of charge carriers and their mobility.\n\nGraphene is a two-dimensional material with a unique electronic band structure, where the conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points. In its pristine state, graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, meaning that there is no energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. This results in a high optical transparency, as the material does not absorb light in the visible range.\n\nWhen graphene is doped, either by chemical or electrostatic means, the Fermi level shifts away from the Dirac point, and the material becomes either an n-type or p-type semiconductor, depending on the type of dopant used. This shift in the Fermi level affects the optical conductivity of graphene.\n\nIn general, the optical conductivity of graphene increases with increasing doping levels. This is because the number of available charge carriers increases, leading to a higher probability of electronic transitions and, consequently, a higher absorption of light. The optical conductivity of graphene can be described by the Kubo formula, which relates the conductivity to the carrier concentration and mobility.\n\nHowever, the relationship between doping and optical conductivity is not linear, and the specific behavior depends on the doping method, the type of dopant, and the concentration of dopants. For example, chemical doping with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing molecules can lead to a saturation of the optical conductivity at high doping levels, as the carrier mobility decreases due to increased scattering from the dopants.\n\nIn summary, the optical conductivity of graphene changes with different levels of doping, generally increasing with higher doping levels. However, the specific behavior depends on the doping method and the type and concentration of dopants. Understanding the relationship between doping and optical conductivity is essential for the development of graphene-based optoelectronic devices, such as transparent conductive films, photodetectors, and solar cells."
