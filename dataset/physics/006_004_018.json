    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of an external electric field. This phenomenon is observed in the hydrogen atom and other atomic systems. The strength of the electric field plays a crucial role in determining the degree of splitting of the spectral lines.\n\nWhen an atom is subjected to an external electric field, the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus gets distorted. This distortion causes a shift in the energy levels of the atom, leading to the splitting of spectral lines. The degree of splitting depends on the strength of the electric field and the quantum numbers associated with the energy levels.\n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are characterized by three quantum numbers: the principal quantum number (n), the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l), and the magnetic quantum number (m). The Stark effect causes the energy levels to split into 2l + 1 sublevels, each corresponding to a different value of m.\n\nThe splitting patterns for different hydrogen spectral series can be understood by considering the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. For the Stark effect, the selection rules are:\n\n1. Δl = ±1\n2. Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThese rules imply that the transitions between energy levels with the same value of m are allowed, as well as transitions between energy levels with Δm = ±1.\n\nNow, let's consider the different hydrogen spectral series:\n\n1. Lyman series (n' = 1): In this series, the lower energy level has l = 0, so there is no splitting due to the Stark effect. However, the upper energy levels with l = 1 can split into three sublevels (m = -1, 0, 1). The transitions between these sublevels and the ground state result in three spectral lines with different wavelengths.\n\n2. Balmer series (n' = 2): In this series, the lower energy level has l = 1, which can split into three sublevels (m = -1, 0, 1). The upper energy levels with l = 0 or l = 2 can also split into sublevels. The allowed transitions between these sublevels result in a more complex splitting pattern, with multiple spectral lines corresponding to different values of m.\n\n3. Paschen series (n' = 3) and higher series: As we move to higher series, the splitting patterns become even more complex due to the increasing number of allowed transitions between sublevels with different values of m.\n\nIn summary, the strength of the electric field affects the splitting of spectral lines in the Stark effect by causing a shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. The degree of splitting depends on the strength of the electric field and the quantum numbers associated with the energy levels. The splitting patterns for different hydrogen spectral series are determined by the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and the allowed transitions between energy levels with different values of m."
