    "message_1": "What is the angle of rotation of plane polarized light when it travels through a quarter-wave plate with a thickness of 1 mm and a refractive index of 1.5?",
    "message_2": "A quarter-wave plate is an optical device that shifts the phase of light by a quarter of a wavelength (90 degrees) between the two orthogonal components of polarization. The angle of rotation of plane polarized light when it travels through a quarter-wave plate depends on the wavelength of the light and the refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary rays.\n\nFor a quarter-wave plate, the phase difference between the ordinary and extraordinary rays should be 90 degrees, which can be expressed as:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (ne - no) * d / λ = π/2\n\nWhere Δφ is the phase difference, ne and no are the refractive indices of the extraordinary and ordinary rays, d is the thickness of the plate, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this case, we are given the refractive index of the material (1.5) and the thickness of the plate (1 mm). However, we do not have enough information to determine the refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary rays or the wavelength of the light. Therefore, we cannot calculate the angle of rotation of plane polarized light in this case."
