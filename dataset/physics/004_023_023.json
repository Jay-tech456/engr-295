    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and wavelength of gravitational waves generated by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the system (M) and the reduced mass (μ) of the two black holes.\n2. Calculate the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the merger.\n3. Calculate the wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total mass (M) and the reduced mass (μ) of the two black holes.\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses\nM2 = 40 solar masses\n\nTotal mass, M = M1 + M2 = 30 + 40 = 70 solar masses\nReduced mass, μ = (M1 * M2) / (M1 + M2) = (30 * 40) / (30 + 40) = 1200 / 70 ≈ 17.14 solar masses\n\nStep 2: Calculate the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the merger.\n\nThe characteristic frequency of gravitational waves during the merger of two black holes can be approximated as:\n\nf ≈ (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the total mass of the system in kilograms.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total mass from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nM ≈ 70 solar masses ≈ 70 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) ≈ 1.392 x 10^32 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the characteristic frequency:\n\nf ≈ (c^3) / (G * M * π) ≈ (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.392 x 10^32 kg * π) ≈ 1.69 x 10^3 Hz\n\nStep 3: Calculate the wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves.\n\nThe wavelength of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the speed of light (c) and the frequency (f):\n\nλ = c / f ≈ (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.69 x 10^3 Hz) ≈ 1.78 x 10^5 m\n\nSo, the theoretical frequency of the gravitational waves generated by the merger of the two black holes is approximately 1.69 x 10^3 Hz (1.69 kHz), and the wavelength is approximately 1.78 x 10^5 m (178 km)."
