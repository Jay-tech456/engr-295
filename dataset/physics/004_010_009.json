    "message_2": "The event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, as described by the Schwarzschild metric, can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 2 solar masses, we first need to convert this to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so 2 solar masses would be:\n\nM = 2 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 3.978 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr_s = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (3.978 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ 5.906 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses is approximately 5,906 meters or 5.906 kilometers."
