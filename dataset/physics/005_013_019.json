    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the particle immediately before the collision, we need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relativistic momentum of the particle. The relativistic momentum is given by:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the particle is traveling at 0.8c, we have:\n\np = (1 GeV/c²) * (0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)²)\np = (0.8 GeV/c) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = (0.8 GeV/c) / sqrt(0.36)\np = (0.8 GeV/c) / 0.6\np = 1.333 GeV/c\n\nNow that we have the relativistic momentum, we can find the total energy using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\nE² = ((1 GeV/c²)c²)² + ((1.333 GeV/c)c)²\nE² = (1 GeV)² + (1.333 GeV)²\nE² = 1 + 1.777\nE² = 2.777 GeV²\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nE = sqrt(2.777 GeV²)\nE ≈ 1.667 GeV\n\nSo the total energy of the particle immediately before it collides with the target particle is approximately 1.667 GeV."
