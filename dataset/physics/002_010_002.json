    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water is the amount of heat required to convert 1 kg of water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase at a constant temperature and pressure. At a pressure of 1 atmosphere (101.3 kPa) and a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, the latent heat of vaporization of water is approximately 2,260 kJ/kg (kilojoules per kilogram). This value can vary slightly depending on the reference source, but it is generally accepted as the standard value for these conditions."
