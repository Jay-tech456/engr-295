    "message_2": "The relationship between the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed can be described using the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation states that the rate constant (k) of a reaction is proportional to the exponential of the negative activation energy (Ea) divided by the product of the gas constant (R) and the temperature (T):\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nIn this equation, A is the pre-exponential factor, which is related to the frequency of collisions between reactants.\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. By providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, enzymes increase the rate constant (k) and, consequently, the rate of the reaction.\n\nThe thermodynamics of a reaction, however, are not affected by the presence of an enzyme. The change in Gibbs free energy (Î”G) and the equilibrium constant (K_eq) remain the same, as enzymes do not alter the overall energy landscape of the reaction. Enzymes only affect the kinetics of the reaction, making it proceed faster by lowering the activation energy.\n\nIn summary, enzymes increase the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed, but they do not affect the thermodynamics of the reaction."
