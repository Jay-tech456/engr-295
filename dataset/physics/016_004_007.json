    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field at which a superconductor transitions from its zero resistance state to a resistive state is known as the upper critical field (Hc2). The upper critical field is a key parameter in determining the performance of a superconductor, as it sets the limit for the maximum magnetic field that the superconductor can withstand while maintaining its superconducting properties.\n\nThe upper critical field depends on the temperature of the superconductor. As the temperature of the superconductor decreases, the upper critical field increases. This relationship can be described by the empirical Ginzburg-Landau equation:\n\nHc2(T) = Hc2(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere Hc2(T) is the upper critical field at temperature T, Hc2(0) is the upper critical field at absolute zero temperature (0 K), Tc is the critical temperature at which the superconductor transitions from a normal state to a superconducting state, and T is the temperature of the superconductor.\n\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon in which certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields when cooled below a certain critical temperature. This phenomenon was first discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who observed that the electrical resistance of mercury vanished at a temperature of 4.2 K.\n\nThe role of magnetic fields in the transition of a superconductor can be understood through the Meissner effect. When a superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature in the presence of a magnetic field, it expels the magnetic field from its interior, creating a region with zero magnetic field inside the superconductor. This expulsion of magnetic fields is a characteristic property of superconductors and is a direct consequence of their zero electrical resistance.\n\nHowever, when the applied magnetic field exceeds the upper critical field (Hc2), the superconductor can no longer maintain its zero resistance state and transitions to a resistive state. This transition occurs because the applied magnetic field disrupts the formation of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconducting properties of the material. Cooper pairs are pairs of electrons that are bound together in a way that allows them to move through the superconductor without resistance. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it can break these pairs apart, causing the superconductor to lose its superconducting properties and transition to a resistive state."
