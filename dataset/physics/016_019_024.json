    "message_1": "A Physics student needs to calculate the total flux through a superconducting disk of radius 5 cm when a magnetic field of 0.3 T is applied perpendicular to the disk. The disk has a thickness of 1 mm and is penetrated by 10,000 vortices. Given that the total flux is proportional to the number of vortices, what is the proportionality constant?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total flux through the superconducting disk, we can use the formula for the magnetic flux through a flat surface:\n\nΦ = B * A\n\nwhere Φ is the magnetic flux, B is the magnetic field, and A is the area of the surface.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the disk:\n\nA = π * r^2\nA = π * (0.05 m)^2\nA ≈ 0.00785 m^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic flux through the disk:\n\nΦ = B * A\nΦ = 0.3 T * 0.00785 m^2\nΦ ≈ 0.002355 Tm^2\n\nSince the total flux is proportional to the number of vortices, we can write the proportionality equation as:\n\nΦ_total = k * N\n\nwhere Φ_total is the total flux, k is the proportionality constant, and N is the number of vortices.\n\nWe are given that there are 10,000 vortices, so we can solve for the proportionality constant:\n\n0.002355 Tm^2 = k * 10,000\nk ≈ 0.002355 Tm^2 / 10,000\nk ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-7) Tm^2/vortex\n\nSo, the proportionality constant is approximately 2.355 × 10^(-7) Tm^2/vortex."
