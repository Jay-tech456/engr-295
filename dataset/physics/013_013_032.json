    "message_1": "What is the rotational period of a neutron star with a radius of 10 km and a mass of 1.4 solar masses, if it emits pulses of radiation every 0.1 seconds as observed from Earth?",
    "message_2": "To find the rotational period of a neutron star, we can use the following formula:\n\nT = 2πr / v\n\nwhere T is the rotational period, r is the radius of the neutron star, and v is the linear velocity at the surface of the neutron star.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear velocity (v) at the surface of the neutron star. We can do this using the formula for the Doppler effect:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency of the pulses, f_emitted is the emitted frequency of the pulses, v is the linear velocity at the surface of the neutron star, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given that the pulses of radiation are observed every 0.1 seconds, so the observed frequency is:\n\nf_observed = 1 / 0.1 s = 10 Hz\n\nWe also know that the emitted frequency is equal to the rotational frequency of the neutron star, which is related to the rotational period by:\n\nf_emitted = 1 / T\n\nNow we can solve for v using the Doppler effect formula:\n\n10 Hz = (1 / T) * (1 + v / (3 x 10^8 m/s))\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the neutron star in kilograms. We are given that the mass of the neutron star is 1.4 solar masses. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nmass_neutron_star = 1.4 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can use the formula for centripetal acceleration to relate the linear velocity (v) to the rotational period (T):\n\na = v^2 / r\n\nwhere a is the centripetal acceleration and r is the radius of the neutron star.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration is provided by the gravitational force acting on the surface of the neutron star, so we can use the formula for gravitational acceleration:\n\na = G * mass_neutron_star / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2).\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for centripetal acceleration and solve for v:\n\nv^2 / r = G * mass_neutron_star / r^2\n\nv^2 = G * mass_neutron_star / r\n\nv = sqrt(G * mass_neutron_star / r)\n\nv = sqrt((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2) * (2.7846 x 10^30 kg) / (10 x 10^3 m))\n\nv ≈ 1.978 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow that we have the linear velocity, we can go back to the Doppler effect formula and solve for the emitted frequency:\n\n10 Hz = (1 / T) * (1 + (1.978 x 10^8 m/s) / (3 x 10^8 m/s))\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT ≈ 0.0996 s\n\nSo the rotational period of the neutron star is approximately 0.0996 seconds."
