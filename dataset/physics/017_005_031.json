    "message_2": "I will choose copper as the material to investigate how its electrical conductivity changes with temperature.\n\nCopper is a widely used conductor in electrical wiring and electronic devices due to its high electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of a material is the measure of its ability to allow the flow of electric current. In general, the electrical conductivity of metals decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nFor copper, the relationship between its electrical conductivity (σ) and temperature (T) can be described by the following equation:\n\nσ(T) = σ_0 [1 - α(T - T_0)]\n\nwhere:\n- σ(T) is the electrical conductivity at temperature T\n- σ_0 is the electrical conductivity at a reference temperature T_0 (usually room temperature, around 20°C or 293 K)\n- α is the temperature coefficient of resistivity\n- (T - T_0) is the difference between the temperature T and the reference temperature T_0\n\nFor copper, the temperature coefficient of resistivity (α) is approximately 0.00393 K^(-1) at 20°C. This means that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, the electrical conductivity of copper decreases by approximately 0.393%.\n\nLet's consider an example to see how the conductivity of copper changes with temperature:\n\nSuppose we have a copper wire with an electrical conductivity of σ_0 = 58 MS/m (Mega Siemens per meter) at room temperature (T_0 = 20°C or 293 K). We want to find the conductivity of the copper wire at T = 100°C (373 K).\n\nUsing the equation mentioned above:\n\nσ(100°C) = 58 MS/m * [1 - 0.00393 * (100 - 20)]\nσ(100°C) = 58 MS/m * [1 - 0.00393 * 80]\nσ(100°C) = 58 MS/m * [1 - 0.3144]\nσ(100°C) = 58 MS/m * 0.6856\nσ(100°C) ≈ 39.76 MS/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire at 100°C is approximately 39.76 MS/m. As the temperature increased from 20°C to 100°C, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire decreased by about 31.44%.\n\nIn summary, the electrical conductivity of copper decreases as the temperature increases. This is due to the increased thermal vibrations of the copper atoms, which cause more scattering of the electrons and thus a higher resistance to the flow of electric current."
