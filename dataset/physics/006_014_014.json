    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of an excited state of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the spontaneous emission rate, which is given by:\n\nΓ = (2πe²)/(3ε₀h) * (1/n³) * f\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, h is the Planck constant, n is the principal quantum number, and f is the oscillator strength.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the oscillator strength f is approximately equal to 1. The lifetime τ of the excited state is the inverse of the spontaneous emission rate:\n\nτ = 1/Γ\n\nLet's calculate the lifetime for the n=4 and n=2 energy levels.\n\nFor n=4:\nΓ_4 = (2πe²)/(3ε₀h) * (1/4³)\nτ_4 = 1/Γ_4\n\nFor n=2:\nΓ_2 = (2πe²)/(3ε₀h) * (1/2³)\nτ_2 = 1/Γ_2\n\nNow, let's compare the lifetimes of the two energy levels by taking the ratio:\n\nτ_4/τ_2 = Γ_2/Γ_4 = (1/4³) / (1/2³) = (2³) / (4³) = 1/4\n\nSo, the lifetime of the hydrogen atom in the n=4 energy level is 1/4 of the lifetime of the same atom in the n=2 energy level. This means that the hydrogen atom in the n=4 energy level has a shorter lifetime and will decay faster than the atom in the n=2 energy level."
