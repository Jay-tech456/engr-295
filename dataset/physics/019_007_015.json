    "message_2": "The Casimir effect is a small attractive force that acts between two close parallel uncharged conducting plates. It is due to quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. In a parallel plate configuration, the Casimir effect can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nF_C = (π²ħc)/(240a⁴)\n\nwhere F_C is the Casimir force per unit area, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and a is the distance between the plates.\n\nThe Casimir force is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance between the plates (a⁴). As the distance between the plates decreases, the strength of the Casimir force increases, and vice versa. This means that the Casimir force becomes stronger when the plates are closer together and weaker when they are further apart."
