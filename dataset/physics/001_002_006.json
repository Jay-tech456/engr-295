    "message_1": "A photon of wavelength 500 nm is fired at a screen with two slits positioned 0.25 mm apart. What is the maximum distance between the brightest spot and the center of the screen? Using the uncertainty principle, what is the uncertainty in velocity of the photon?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum distance between the brightest spot and the center of the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of the first bright fringe in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nθ = arcsin(mλ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the photon, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 500 nm = 5 x 10^-7 m and the distance between the slits d = 0.25 mm = 2.5 x 10^-4 m, we can find the angular position of the first bright fringe:\n\nθ = arcsin(1 * (5 x 10^-7 m) / (2.5 x 10^-4 m))\nθ ≈ 0.002 rad\n\nTo find the maximum distance between the brightest spot and the center of the screen, we can use the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the distance between the brightest spot and the center of the screen, and L is the distance between the screen and the slits. However, we don't have the value of L, so we can only express the maximum distance in terms of L:\n\ny = L * tan(0.002 rad)\n\nNow, let's find the uncertainty in the velocity of the photon using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nSince the photon passes through the slits, we can assume that the uncertainty in position is approximately equal to the distance between the slits:\n\nΔx ≈ 2.5 x 10^-4 m\n\nThe momentum of a photon is given by:\n\np = h / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (h ≈ 6.626 x 10^-34 Js). The uncertainty in momentum can be expressed as:\n\nΔp = Δx * (h / λ^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔp ≈ (2.5 x 10^-4 m) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (5 x 10^-7 m)^2\nΔp ≈ 1.656 x 10^-29 kg m/s\n\nSince the photon's momentum is related to its velocity by:\n\np = E / c = (h / λ) * (c / λ) = h / λ^2\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon and c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s), we can find the uncertainty in velocity:\n\nΔv = Δp * λ^2 / h\nΔv ≈ (1.656 x 10^-29 kg m/s) * (5 x 10^-7 m)^2 / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nΔv ≈ 6.25 x 10^-4 m/s\n\nSo, the uncertainty in the velocity of the photon is approximately 6.25 x 10^-4 m/s."
