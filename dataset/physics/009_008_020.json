    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification using a ray diagram, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula. The lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (u) is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(2 + 1)/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 20/(2 + 1)\nv = 20/3\nv = 6.67 cm (approximately)\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is approximately 6.67 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -6.67/20\nM = -1/3\n\nThe magnification is -1/3, which means the image is inverted (negative sign) and 1/3 the size of the object.\n\nIn summary, the image distance is approximately 6.67 cm, and the magnification is -1/3."
