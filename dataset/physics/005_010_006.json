According to the observer on the spacecraft, what will be the wavelength and the direction of the starlight? Use the relativistic aberration formula to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the observed wavelength and direction of the starlight, we need to use both the relativistic Doppler effect formula and the relativistic aberration formula.\n\n1. Relativistic Doppler effect formula:\nThe formula for the relativistic Doppler effect is given by:\n\nλ_obs = λ_em * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere λ_obs is the observed wavelength, λ_em is the emitted wavelength, and β is the ratio of the spacecraft's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c).\n\nGiven that the spacecraft travels at 0.6c, β = 0.6. The emitted wavelength λ_em is 555 nm.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nλ_obs = 555 nm * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\nλ_obs = 555 nm * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\nλ_obs = 555 nm * sqrt(4)\nλ_obs = 555 nm * 2\nλ_obs = 1110 nm\n\nSo, the observed wavelength of the starlight is 1110 nm.\n\n2. Relativistic aberration formula:\nThe formula for the relativistic aberration is given by:\n\ncos(θ_obs) = (cos(θ_em) + β) / (1 + β * cos(θ_em))\n\nwhere θ_obs is the observed angle of the starlight, θ_em is the emitted angle, and β is the ratio of the spacecraft's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c).\n\nSince the spacecraft is traveling directly towards the star, the emitted angle θ_em is 0 degrees. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\ncos(θ_obs) = (cos(0) + 0.6) / (1 + 0.6 * cos(0))\ncos(θ_obs) = (1 + 0.6) / (1 + 0.6)\ncos(θ_obs) = 1.6 / 1.6\ncos(θ_obs) = 1\n\nTaking the inverse cosine, we get:\n\nθ_obs = arccos(1)\nθ_obs = 0 degrees\n\nSo, the observed direction of the starlight is 0 degrees, which means it is still directly towards the star.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the observer on the spacecraft, the wavelength of the starlight is 1110 nm, and the direction is directly towards the star (0 degrees)."
