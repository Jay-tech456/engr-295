    "message_2": "The rotation curve of a spiral galaxy provides evidence for the existence of dark matter through the observed discrepancy between the expected rotational velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy and the actual observed velocities. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\nIn a spiral galaxy, stars and gas clouds orbit around the galactic center. According to Newtonian dynamics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the rotational velocities of these objects to decrease as their distance from the galactic center increases. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible mass in the galaxy should decrease with distance, leading to slower orbital speeds.\n\nHowever, when astronomers measure the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, they find that the rotational velocities of stars and gas do not decrease as expected. Instead, the velocities remain relatively constant or even increase slightly with distance from the galactic center. This observation is inconsistent with the distribution of visible matter in the galaxy and suggests that there is additional, unseen mass influencing the motion of stars and gas.\n\nThis unseen mass is attributed to dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. Dark matter is thought to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe and plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The presence of dark matter in spiral galaxies, as inferred from their rotation curves, provides strong evidence for its existence and its influence on the dynamics of the cosmos."
