    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum power output of a typical pressurized water nuclear reactor, you need to know its thermal energy output and thermal efficiency. The formula to calculate the power output is:\n\nPower Output = Thermal Energy Output × Thermal Efficiency\n\nTypically, pressurized water nuclear reactors have a thermal efficiency of around 33% to 37%. Let's assume a thermal efficiency of 35% (0.35) for this example. Now, we need the thermal energy output, which can vary depending on the reactor's design and size. A common thermal energy output for a pressurized water reactor is around 3000 MWth (megawatts thermal).\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the maximum power output:\n\nPower Output = 3000 MWth × 0.35\nPower Output = 1050 MWe (megawatts electric)\n\nSo, the maximum power output of a typical pressurized water nuclear reactor with a thermal energy output of 3000 MWth and a thermal efficiency of 35% is approximately 1050 MWe."
