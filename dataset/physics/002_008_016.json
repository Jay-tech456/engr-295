    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity (c) of the copper rod, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy supplied (in joules), m is the mass of the rod (in kilograms), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/kg·K), and ΔT is the temperature increase (in degrees Celsius or Kelvin, since we are dealing with a difference in temperature).\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nq = 10,000 J\nm = 500 g = 0.5 kg (converted from grams to kilograms)\nΔT = 20°C\n\nWe need to solve for c:\n\n10,000 J = (0.5 kg) * c * (20°C)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for c:\n\nc = 10,000 J / (0.5 kg * 20°C)\n\nc = 10,000 J / 10 kg·°C\n\nc = 1,000 J/kg·°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the copper rod is 1,000 J/kg·°C."
