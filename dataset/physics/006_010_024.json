    "message_2": "To determine the minimum energy of an alpha particle needed to penetrate a 5 μm gold foil with a probability of 1 in 10,000, we can use the Rutherford scattering formula, which is given by:\n\nN(θ) = (k * Z₁ * Z₂ * e²) / (16 * π * ε₀ * R² * E * sin⁴(θ/2))\n\nWhere:\nN(θ) is the number of scattered particles at angle θ\nk is a constant, which is equal to the number of incident particles\nZ₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the alpha particle (helium nucleus) and gold, respectively\ne is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 x 10⁻¹² C²/Nm²)\nR is the distance between the detector and the gold foil\nE is the energy of the alpha particle\nθ is the scattering angle\n\nSince we are interested in the probability of 1 in 10,000, we can set N(θ) = 1 and k = 10,000. The atomic numbers of the alpha particle (helium nucleus) and gold are 2 and 79, respectively. \n\nWe need to find the scattering angle θ at which the probability is 1 in 10,000. From Rutherford's experiment, we know that the probability of scattering decreases with increasing angle. For a probability of 1 in 10,000, the scattering angle should be close to 180 degrees (or π radians). We can approximate θ ≈ π for this calculation.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to find the energy E:\n\nE = (k * Z₁ * Z₂ * e²) / (16 * π * ε₀ * R² * sin⁴(θ/2))\n\nAssuming a distance R of 1 meter between the detector and the gold foil, we can plug in the values:\n\nE = (10,000 * 2 * 79 * (1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹)²) / (16 * π * (8.85 x 10⁻¹²) * 1² * sin⁴(π/2))\nE ≈ 5.31 x 10⁻¹³ J\n\nTo convert this energy to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ J:\n\nE ≈ (5.31 x 10⁻¹³ J) / (1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV)\nE ≈ 3.32 x 10⁶ eV\n\nTherefore, the minimum energy of an alpha particle needed to penetrate a 5 μm gold foil with a probability of 1 in 10,000 is approximately 3.32 MeV."
