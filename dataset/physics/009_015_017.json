    "message_2": "To calculate the spherical aberration of the mirror, we first need to find the focal length (f) and the position of the real image (q) formed by the mirror.\n\nThe radius of curvature (R) is given as 20 cm. The focal length (f) of the mirror can be calculated using the formula:\n\nf = R / 2\nf = 20 cm / 2\nf = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the position of the real image (q):\n\n1/f = 1/p + 1/q\n\nwhere p is the object distance (60 cm) and q is the image distance.\n\n1/10 = 1/60 + 1/q\n\nTo solve for q, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n1/10 - 1/60 = 1/q\n\nNow, we can solve for q:\n\n(6 - 1) / 60 = 1/q\n5 / 60 = 1/q\nq = 60 / 5\nq = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the position of the real image (q), we can calculate the spherical aberration. Spherical aberration is the difference between the paraxial image distance (q) and the marginal image distance (q_m). The marginal image distance is the distance at which the image is formed by the rays that are close to the edge of the mirror.\n\nIn the case of spherical aberration, the marginal image distance (q_m) is slightly different from the paraxial image distance (q). However, calculating the exact value of q_m requires a more complex analysis of the mirror's shape and the incoming light rays. Therefore, we cannot provide an exact value for the spherical aberration without more information.\n\nIn summary, we have found the focal length (f) to be 10 cm and the position of the real image (q) to be 12 cm. However, we cannot calculate the exact spherical aberration without more information about the mirror's shape and the incoming light rays."
