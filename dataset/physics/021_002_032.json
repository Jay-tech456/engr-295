Specifically, calculate the radius and surface area of the event horizon for a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses and a rotation rate of 90% of the maximum allowed value.",
    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light. The properties of the event horizon are determined by the mass and spin (angular momentum) of the black hole. For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the event horizon is a perfect sphere, and its radius is called the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating (Kerr) black hole, the event horizon is oblate, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nThe radius of the event horizon for a rotating black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = r_s * (1 + sqrt(1 - (a/M)^2))\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, a is the angular momentum per unit mass, and M is the mass of the black hole. The Schwarzschild radius is given by:\n\nr_s = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses and a rotation rate of 90% of the maximum allowed value, we can calculate the radius of the event horizon:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nr_s = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.989 x 10^31) / (2.998 x 10^8)^2\nr_s ≈ 29,543 meters\n\nThe maximum allowed value for a/M is 1, so for a rotation rate of 90% of the maximum allowed value, a/M = 0.9.\n\nr = 29,543 * (1 + sqrt(1 - (0.9)^2))\nr ≈ 29,543 * (1 + sqrt(0.19))\nr ≈ 34,084 meters\n\nNow we can calculate the surface area of the event horizon, which for a rotating black hole is given by:\n\nA = 4 * pi * r^2\n\nA ≈ 4 * pi * (34,084)^2\nA ≈ 1.46 x 10^10 square meters\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for this black hole is approximately 34,084 meters, and the surface area is approximately 1.46 x 10^10 square meters."
