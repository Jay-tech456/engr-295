    "message_1": "A convex lens has a focal length of 15 cm and an object is placed 30 cm away from it. If the refractive index of the lens is 1.5, what is the distance of the image from the lens and what is the magnification of the image? Use lens maker's equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image from the lens and the magnification of the image, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\nu = -30 cm (object distance is taken as negative for a real object)\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n1/15 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/15 + 1/30\n1/v = (2 + 1) / 30\n1/v = 3/30\nv = 30/3\nv = 10 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 10 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -10 / (-30)\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object.\n\nSo, the distance of the image from the lens is 10 cm, and the magnification of the image is 1/3."
