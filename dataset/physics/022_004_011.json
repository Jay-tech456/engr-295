    "message_2": "Quantitative evidence for the presence of dark matter in galaxies comes from several independent observations and measurements. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: When observing the rotational speeds of stars and gas in galaxies, it was found that their velocities do not decrease with distance from the galactic center as expected from Newtonian dynamics. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat or even increase, indicating that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects have shown that the mass distribution in galaxy clusters is much greater than what can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the distribution of matter at that time. Analysis of the CMB data indicates that the universe is composed of roughly 27% dark matter, with only about 5% being ordinary matter.\n\n4. Large scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding upon which galaxies and galaxy clusters form, as it clumps together under gravity, attracting ordinary matter to form stars and galaxies.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of galaxy clusters that have collided. Observations of this system show that the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing) is separated from the hot gas (which is visible in X-ray observations). This provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the majority of the mass is not associated with the visible matter.\n\nDark matter contributes to the stability and growth of galactic structures in several ways:\n\n1. Gravitational binding: Dark matter provides additional gravitational force that helps to bind galaxies and galaxy clusters together. Without dark matter, the observed rotational speeds of stars in galaxies would be too high for the galaxies to remain gravitationally bound.\n\n2. Structure formation: As mentioned earlier, dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. It acts as a gravitational seed for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, allowing them to grow and evolve over time.\n\n3. Galaxy mergers: Dark matter halos surrounding galaxies can help facilitate galaxy mergers, which are essential for the growth and evolution of galaxies. The additional mass provided by dark matter can help stabilize the merging process and prevent the galaxies from being torn apart by tidal forces.\n\nIn summary, quantitative evidence for dark matter comes from various observations, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB radiation, large scale structure formation, and the Bullet Cluster. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the stability and growth of galactic structures by providing additional gravitational force, facilitating structure formation, and enabling galaxy mergers."
