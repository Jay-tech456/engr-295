    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and heat of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nWe are also given the temperature (T2) as 25°C, which we need to convert to Kelvin:\n\nT2 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nWe need to find the vapor pressure of water (P2) at 25°C. We know that the standard atmospheric pressure (P1) is 101.325 kPa, and the vapor pressure of water at 100°C (T1) is equal to the atmospheric pressure:\n\nP1 = 101.325 kPa = 101325 Pa\n\nT1 = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -40700 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp[-40700 / (8.314) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)]\nP2 ≈ 3169.6 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3169.6 Pa or 3.17 kPa."
