    "message_2": "Isotopes, isobars, and isotones are terms used to describe different types of atomic nuclei that share certain properties. They are distinguished by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Here's a detailed explanation of each term along with examples:\n\n1. Isotopes:\nIsotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons in their nuclei. Since the number of protons determines the element's atomic number, isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers (sum of protons and neutrons).\n\nExample: Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium (¹H), deuterium (²H), and tritium (³H). All three isotopes have one proton in their nucleus, but protium has no neutrons, deuterium has one neutron, and tritium has two neutrons.\n\n2. Isobars:\nIsobars are atoms of different elements that have the same mass number but different atomic numbers. This means they have a different number of protons but the same total number of protons and neutrons in their nuclei.\n\nExample: Argon-40 (¹⁸Ar) and potassium-40 (¹⁹K) are isobars. Both have a mass number of 40, but Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons, while potassium has 19 protons and 21 neutrons.\n\n3. Isotones:\nIsotones are atoms of different elements that have the same number of neutrons but different numbers of protons in their nuclei. This means they have different atomic numbers and mass numbers, but the same number of neutrons.\n\nExample: Carbon-14 (⁶C) and nitrogen-15 (⁷N) are isotones. Both have 8 neutrons in their nuclei, but carbon-14 has 6 protons and a mass number of 14, while nitrogen-15 has 7 protons and a mass number of 15.\n\nIn summary, isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, isobars have the same mass number but different atomic numbers, and isotones have the same number of neutrons but different atomic and mass numbers."
