    "message_2": "High-energy cosmic rays are charged particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that travel through the universe at nearly the speed of light. The exact mechanism responsible for generating these high-energy cosmic rays is still a topic of ongoing research, but several sources have been identified as potential candidates.\n\n1. Supernova remnants: When a massive star explodes in a supernova, it releases a tremendous amount of energy. The shock waves from these explosions can accelerate charged particles to extremely high energies, generating cosmic rays.\n\n2. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): The supermassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies can emit powerful jets of energy and matter. These jets can also accelerate charged particles to high energies, producing cosmic rays.\n\n3. Gamma-ray bursts: These are extremely energetic explosions that occur in distant galaxies, and they are thought to be associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. Gamma-ray bursts can also accelerate particles to high energies, contributing to the cosmic ray flux.\n\nCosmic rays travel through the universe following the magnetic fields present in interstellar and intergalactic space. These magnetic fields can cause the cosmic rays to change direction, making their paths through the universe somewhat random. This is known as cosmic ray diffusion.\n\nDespite traveling through the vacuum of space for billions of years, cosmic rays can maintain their high energies due to the lack of interaction with other particles. In the vacuum of space, there are very few particles for cosmic rays to collide with, so they do not lose energy through collisions as they would in a denser medium. Additionally, since cosmic rays are charged particles, they do not lose energy through radiation as photons do.\n\nHowever, cosmic rays do lose some energy through interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). When high-energy cosmic rays collide with CMBR photons, they can produce secondary particles, such as electron-positron pairs or pions. This process, known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect, limits the maximum energy of cosmic rays that can be observed at Earth to around 10^20 electron volts (eV)."
