    "message_2": "The hyperfine splitting energy for the 133Cs atom in the ground state can be determined using the formula:\n\nΔE = h × Δν\n\nwhere ΔE is the hyperfine splitting energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), and Δν is the frequency difference between the two hyperfine levels.\n\nFor 133Cs, the frequency difference Δν is approximately 9.192631770 GHz.\n\nNow, we can calculate the hyperfine splitting energy:\n\nΔE = (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) × (9.192631770 × 10^9 Hz)\nΔE ≈ 6.069 × 10^(-25) J\n\nThe hyperfine splitting energy for the 133Cs atom in the ground state is approximately 6.069 × 10^(-25) J.\n\nTo find the wavelength of the transition between the two levels of the hyperfine splitting, we can use the formula:\n\nλ = c / ν\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (3.0 × 10^8 m/s), and ν is the frequency of the transition.\n\nWe already have the frequency difference Δν, so we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (3.0 × 10^8 m/s) / (9.192631770 × 10^9 Hz)\nλ ≈ 3.262 × 10^(-2) m\n\nThe wavelength of the transition between the two levels of the hyperfine splitting for the 133Cs atom in the ground state is approximately 3.262 × 10^(-2) m or 32.62 mm."
