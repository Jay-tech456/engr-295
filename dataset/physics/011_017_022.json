    "message_2": "Ferroelectric materials are characterized by their spontaneous polarization, which can be reversed by applying an external electric field. When an external electric field is applied to a ferroelectric crystal, it can cause changes in the crystal structure, domain configuration, and polarization state. These changes can be studied using various experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction and polarization measurements.\n\n1. Changes in crystal structure: The application of an external electric field can induce a structural phase transition in the ferroelectric crystal. This phase transition may involve changes in the unit cell parameters, atomic positions, and symmetry of the crystal structure. X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique to study these structural changes. By analyzing the diffraction patterns, one can obtain information about the unit cell parameters, atomic positions, and space group of the crystal in different electric field conditions.\n\n2. Changes in domain configuration: Ferroelectric materials typically consist of domains with different polarization directions. The application of an external electric field can cause domain switching, i.e., the reorientation of the polarization direction in some domains to align with the applied field. This process leads to changes in the domain configuration, which can be studied using techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and domain imaging using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n\n3. Changes in polarization state: The polarization state of a ferroelectric material can be characterized by its hysteresis loop, which represents the relationship between the applied electric field and the resulting polarization. Polarization measurements can be performed using various techniques, such as the Sawyer-Tower circuit or the double-wave method. By measuring the hysteresis loops under different electric field conditions, one can study the changes in the polarization state of the ferroelectric crystal.\n\nIn summary, the ferroelectric properties of a crystal can change significantly under the influence of an external electric field. These changes can be studied using experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction, which provides information about the crystal structure, and polarization measurements, which reveal the polarization state of the material. Additionally, domain imaging techniques can be employed to investigate the changes in domain configuration. By combining these techniques, a comprehensive understanding of the ferroelectric properties and their response to external electric fields can be achieved."
