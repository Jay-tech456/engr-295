    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for hydrogen nuclei (protons) to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and undergo fusion in the core of a star with a mass similar to our Sun is approximately 10 million Kelvin (10^7 K). This temperature is necessary for protons to have enough kinetic energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them and get close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over, allowing them to fuse and form helium.\n\nFor stars with different masses, the required temperature for fusion to occur can vary. In general, more massive stars require higher core temperatures to initiate and sustain fusion. This is because the gravitational pressure in the core of a more massive star is greater, and higher temperatures are needed to counterbalance this pressure and prevent the star from collapsing.\n\nLess massive stars, on the other hand, require lower core temperatures for fusion to occur. However, there is a lower limit to the mass of a star that can sustain hydrogen fusion, which is around 0.08 solar masses. Below this mass, the core temperature and pressure are not sufficient for hydrogen fusion, and the object is considered a brown dwarf rather than a true star.\n\nIn summary, the minimum temperature required for hydrogen fusion in a star's core depends on its mass, with more massive stars requiring higher temperatures and less massive stars requiring lower temperatures. For a star with a mass similar to our Sun, the minimum temperature is approximately 10 million Kelvin."
