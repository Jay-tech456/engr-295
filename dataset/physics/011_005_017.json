    "message_2": "In a ferromagnetic material, the relationship between temperature and magnetization is governed by the alignment of magnetic moments within the material. At low temperatures, the magnetic moments are aligned, resulting in a strong net magnetization. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments to become more randomly oriented, leading to a decrease in the net magnetization.\n\nThe Curie temperature (Tc) is a critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic. This occurs because the thermal energy at the Curie temperature is high enough to overcome the exchange interaction that aligns the magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic material.\n\nAt the Curie temperature, the magnetization of the material drops abruptly to zero. Below the Curie temperature, the magnetization decreases with increasing temperature, following the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nM(T) = M0(1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nwhere M(T) is the magnetization at temperature T, M0 is the magnetization at absolute zero, Tc is the Curie temperature, and β is a critical exponent (typically around 0.5 for ferromagnetic materials).\n\nIn summary, the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material decreases with increasing temperature, and the material loses its ferromagnetic properties at the Curie temperature, becoming paramagnetic. The Curie temperature is a crucial parameter in determining the practical applications of ferromagnetic materials, as it sets the upper limit for their use in magnetic devices and systems."
