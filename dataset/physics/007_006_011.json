    "message_1": "A beam of neutrons with a wavelength of 1 Angstrom is directed towards a crystal of sodium chloride. The crystal has a cube structure with edge length 5 Angstroms. Assuming the crystal lattice is perfect and the neutron beam enters the crystal in the [100] direction, calculate the angle at which the first order diffraction peak will be observed.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle at which the first order diffraction peak will be observed, we can use Bragg's Law:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of diffraction (in this case, n = 1), λ is the wavelength of the neutrons (1 Angstrom), d is the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and θ is the angle of diffraction.\n\nSince the crystal has a cubic structure with an edge length of 5 Angstroms, we can calculate the interplanar spacing (d) for the [100] direction as follows:\n\nd = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\n\nwhere a is the edge length (5 Angstroms), and h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the [100] direction (h = 1, k = 0, l = 0).\n\nd = 5 / √(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 5 / √1 = 5 Angstroms\n\nNow we can use Bragg's Law to find the angle θ:\n\n1 * 1 = 2 * 5 * sin(θ)\n\n1 = 10 * sin(θ)\n\nsin(θ) = 1/10\n\nθ = arcsin(1/10)\n\nθ ≈ 5.74°\n\nSo the angle at which the first order diffraction peak will be observed is approximately 5.74°."
