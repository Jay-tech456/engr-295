    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes, we need to consider the inspiral phase, where the black holes are orbiting each other and gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves.\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total mass (M) and the reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 30 M_sun + 40 M_sun = 70 M_sun\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (30 M_sun * 40 M_sun) / 70 M_sun ≈ 17.14 M_sun\n\nwhere M_sun is the solar mass (1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the chirp mass (M_c), which is a combination of the total mass and reduced mass:\n\nM_c = μ^(3/5) * M^(2/5) ≈ 20.64 M_sun\n\n3. Now, we can estimate the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/8π) * (1 / M_c)^(5/8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf ≈ 157 Hz\n\n4. To calculate the amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 / d) * (G * M_c / c^2)^(5/4) * (π * f)^(2/3)\n\nwhere d is the distance to the black holes (1 billion light years ≈ 9.461 x 10^24 meters).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nh ≈ 4.2 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 30 and 40 solar masses, located at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth, is approximately 157 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 4.2 x 10^-22."
