    "message_2": "The temperature of the universe at the time when the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) was emitted is approximately 3000 Kelvin (K). This temperature corresponds to the time when the universe was around 380,000 years old.\n\nThe CMB is the relic radiation from the Big Bang and provides us with a snapshot of the early universe. At that time, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of photons, electrons, and protons. As the universe expanded, it cooled down, and eventually, the temperature dropped to a point where protons and electrons could combine to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process is known as recombination. When recombination occurred, photons were no longer scattered by free electrons and could travel freely through the universe. These photons are what we now observe as the CMB.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB is related to the expansion rate of the universe through the scale factor, which is a measure of how much the universe has expanded since the Big Bang. As the universe expands, the wavelength of the CMB photons is stretched, causing them to lose energy and cool down. This process is known as redshift. The temperature of the CMB is inversely proportional to the scale factor, meaning that as the universe expands, the temperature of the CMB decreases.\n\nToday, the temperature of the CMB has cooled down to about 2.725 K due to the expansion of the universe. By studying the CMB, we can learn about the early universe's conditions and the expansion rate, which helps us understand the universe's evolution and the underlying cosmological models."
