    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nrelativistic mass (m) = rest mass (m0) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and m0 is the rest mass.\n\nIn this case, the rest mass (m0) is 10,000 kg, and the velocity (v) is 0.8c, which is equal to 0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nm = 10,000 kg / sqrt(1 - (2.4 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nm = 10,000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm = 10,000 kg / sqrt(0.36)\nm = 10,000 kg / 0.6\nm ≈ 16,666.67 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 16,666.67 kg.\n\nTo find the percentage increase in mass due to its high velocity, we can use the following formula:\n\npercentage increase = ((relativistic mass - rest mass) / rest mass) * 100\n\npercentage increase = ((16,666.67 kg - 10,000 kg) / 10,000 kg) * 100\npercentage increase = (6,666.67 kg / 10,000 kg) * 100\npercentage increase ≈ 66.67%\n\nThe percentage increase in mass due to the spaceship's high velocity is approximately 66.67%."
