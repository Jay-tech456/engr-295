Meanwhile, a clock on the planet's surface that is at rest relative to the planet also shows that one second has elapsed. If the gravitational potential energy on the planet's surface is U0, what is the gravitational potential energy on the satellite? Use the gravitational redshift effect formula to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the gravitational redshift effect formula, which is derived from the general theory of relativity. The formula is given by:\n\nΔν/ν = ΔU/c^2\n\nwhere Δν is the change in frequency of the clock, ν is the initial frequency, ΔU is the change in gravitational potential energy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSince both clocks show that one second has elapsed, the change in frequency is zero (Δν = 0). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = ΔU/c^2\n\nNow, let's find the change in gravitational potential energy (ΔU). The gravitational potential energy at a distance r from the center of a planet with mass M is given by:\n\nU(r) = -GMm/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and m is the mass of the satellite. The potential energy on the planet's surface (U0) is given by:\n\nU0 = -GMm/R_p\n\nwhere R_p is the radius of the planet. The potential energy of the satellite at a distance R from the planet's center is:\n\nU_sat = -GMm/R\n\nThe change in gravitational potential energy is:\n\nΔU = U_sat - U0 = -GMm/R - (-GMm/R_p) = GMm(1/R_p - 1/R)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the gravitational redshift equation:\n\n0 = GMm(1/R_p - 1/R)/c^2\n\nSince the change in frequency is zero, the term inside the parentheses must also be zero:\n\n1/R_p - 1/R = 0\n\n1/R = 1/R_p\n\nR = R_p\n\nThis means that the satellite is orbiting at the same distance as the planet's radius (R = R_p). Therefore, the gravitational potential energy of the satellite is the same as the potential energy on the planet's surface:\n\nU_sat = U0"
