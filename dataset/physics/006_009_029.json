    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength of the scattered X-rays, we can use the Compton scattering formula, which relates the change in wavelength to the scattering angle:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h / (m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\nΔλ is the change in wavelength\nλ is the initial wavelength (0.1 nm)\nλ' is the final wavelength (scattered X-rays)\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nθ is the scattering angle (60 degrees)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the scattering angle to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / ((9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 - cos(π / 3))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.727 x 10^-22 kg m/s) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ ≈ 0.121 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can find the final wavelength (λ'):\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ\nλ' = 0.1 nm + 0.121 x 10^-12 m\nλ' = 0.1 nm + 0.121 pm\n\nConverting the change in wavelength to nm:\n\nΔλ = 0.121 pm * (1 nm / 1000 pm) = 0.000121 nm\n\nSo, the final wavelength is:\n\nλ' = 0.1 nm + 0.000121 nm\nλ' ≈ 0.100121 nm\n\nThe wavelength of the scattered X-rays at an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the incident beam is approximately 0.100121 nm."
