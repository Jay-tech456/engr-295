    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is the heaviest of the three charged leptons, with a mass of approximately 1.78 GeV/c², which is significantly larger than the electron (0.511 MeV/c²) and muon (105.7 MeV/c²). Due to its larger mass, the tau lepton has a wider range of decay modes compared to the electron and muon.\n\nThe decay modes of the tau lepton can be broadly classified into two categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (electron or muon) and a pair of neutrinos. The leptonic decay modes are:\n\n   a) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅ₜ (with a branching ratio of ~17.8%)\n   b) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̅ₜ (with a branching ratio of ~17.4%)\n\nThese leptonic decay modes are similar to the decay modes of the muon, which can decay into an electron and a pair of neutrinos:\n\n   μ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅_μ\n\nHowever, the electron does not have any similar decay modes, as it is the lightest charged lepton and cannot decay into any lighter leptons.\n\n2. Hadronic decays: In these decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes can involve one or more mesons (such as pions or kaons) and can be represented as:\n\n   τ⁻ → hadrons + νₜ\n\nThe hadronic decay modes account for about 64.8% of the tau decays. Some examples of hadronic decay modes are:\n\n   a) τ⁻ → π⁻ + νₜ (with a branching ratio of ~10.9%)\n   b) τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁰ + νₜ (with a branching ratio of ~25.5%)\n   c) τ⁻ → K⁻ + νₜ (with a branching ratio of ~1.1%)\n\nThe electron and muon do not have any hadronic decay modes, as their masses are too small to produce hadrons.\n\nExperimental evidence for the decay modes of the tau lepton comes from various experiments conducted at high-energy particle accelerators, such as the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). These experiments have measured the branching ratios of various decay modes and confirmed the existence of both leptonic and hadronic decays for the tau lepton."
