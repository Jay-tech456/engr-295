    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the circular coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a single circular loop and then multiply it by the number of turns in the coil.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field (B) at the center of a single circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the loop (2 A), and R is the radius of the loop (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field due to a single loop:\n\nB_single = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\nB_single = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\nB_single = 8π × 10^(-6) T\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the coil by multiplying the magnetic field due to a single loop by the number of turns (N = 50):\n\nB_total = N * B_single\nB_total = 50 * 8π × 10^(-6) T\nB_total = 400π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately:\n\nB_total ≈ 400π × 10^(-6) T ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-3) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current in the coil, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the direction of the magnetic field at the center of the coil will be perpendicular to the plane of the coil and pointing upwards (assuming the current flows in the clockwise direction when viewed from above).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 1.26 × 10^(-3) T, and its direction is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, pointing upwards."
