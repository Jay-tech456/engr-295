    "message_1": "A spaceship rests relative to an inertial observer in deep space. The spaceship has a mass of 1000 kg and is initially at rest. It ejects 500 kg of mass at a speed of 0.8c (where c is the speed of light) in the opposite direction to its motion. What is the final velocity of the spaceship? (Assume the ejected mass has negligible mass compared to the spaceship)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system (spaceship + ejected mass) is zero since both are initially at rest. The final momentum of the system must also be zero to conserve momentum.\n\nLet's denote the final velocity of the spaceship as v. The momentum of the ejected mass is given by the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np_ejected = (m_ejected * v_ejected) / sqrt(1 - (v_ejected/c)^2)\n\nwhere m_ejected = 500 kg and v_ejected = -0.8c.\n\nThe momentum of the spaceship after the ejection is:\n\np_spaceship = m_spaceship * v / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere m_spaceship = 1000 kg.\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum of the system should also be zero:\n\np_spaceship + p_ejected = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for v:\n\n(1000 * v) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (500 * 0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2)\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (0.4c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2)\n\nv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (0.4c) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (0.4c) / sqrt(0.36)\n\nv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (0.4c) / 0.6\n\nv / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (2/3)c\n\nNow we can square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\nv^2 / (1 - (v/c)^2) = (4/9)c^2\n\nv^2 = (4/9)c^2 * (1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nv^2 = (4/9)c^2 - (4/9)c^2 * (v/c)^2\n\nNow we can solve for v^2:\n\nv^2 = (4/9)c^2 - (4/9)c^2 * (v^2/c^2)\n\nv^2 = (4/9)c^2 - (4/9)v^2\n\n(13/9)v^2 = (4/9)c^2\n\nv^2 = (4/13)c^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nv = sqrt((4/13)c^2)\n\nv = (2/sqrt(13))c\n\nSo the final velocity of the spaceship is (2/sqrt(13))c, or approximately 0.5547c."
