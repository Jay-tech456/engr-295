    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling away from Earth at a speed of 0.8c. A laser on the spaceship emits a beam of light with a frequency of 5x10^14 Hz. An observer on Earth measures the frequency of the light to be 4x10^14 Hz. What is the frequency of the light as measured by an observer traveling with the spaceship?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the light as measured by an observer traveling with the spaceship, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency measured by the observer on Earth, f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship, β is the ratio of the spaceship's speed to the speed of light (v/c), and sqrt denotes the square root.\n\nWe are given that f_observed = 4x10^14 Hz, β = 0.8, and we want to find f_emitted.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for f_emitted, we get:\n\nf_emitted = f_observed / sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nf_emitted = (4x10^14 Hz) / sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\n\nf_emitted = (4x10^14 Hz) / sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\n\nf_emitted = (4x10^14 Hz) / sqrt(1/9)\n\nf_emitted = (4x10^14 Hz) / (1/3)\n\nf_emitted = 4x10^14 Hz * 3\n\nf_emitted = 12x10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the light as measured by an observer traveling with the spaceship is 12x10^14 Hz."
