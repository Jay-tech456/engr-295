    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the gravitational lensing effect caused by a galaxy cluster. Gravitational lensing occurs when the mass of an object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy. This bending of light is a direct result of the gravitational influence of the massive object, as predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nDark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. In galaxy clusters, dark matter is thought to be the dominant source of mass, far exceeding the mass of visible matter like stars and gas. Since gravitational lensing depends on the total mass of the lensing object, the presence of dark matter greatly enhances the lensing effect.\n\nTo account for the effects of dark matter in calculating the amount of gravitational lensing observed, astronomers use a variety of techniques. One common method is to study the distribution of visible matter in the galaxy cluster and then use computer simulations to model the distribution of dark matter. These simulations take into account the observed properties of the visible matter, such as the velocities of galaxies within the cluster, as well as the overall mass distribution inferred from the lensing effect.\n\nAnother approach is to use weak gravitational lensing, which measures the subtle distortions in the shapes of background galaxies caused by the gravitational influence of the foreground galaxy cluster. By analyzing these distortions, astronomers can create a map of the mass distribution within the cluster, including both visible and dark matter.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can account for the effects of dark matter in their calculations of gravitational lensing. This allows them to better understand the properties of dark matter, its distribution within galaxy clusters, and its overall role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures."
