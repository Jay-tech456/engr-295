    "message_1": "A laser pointer with a wavelength of 650 nm is aimed at a single slit of width 0.2 mm. If the screen is placed 2 meters away from the slit, what is the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen? (Assuming the central fringe is at position zero)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of bright fringes in single-slit diffraction:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 2 for the second bright fringe, and so on), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\nSlit width (a) = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\nDistance from the slit to the screen (L) = 2 m\n\nNow, we will find the angular position of the first and second bright fringes:\n\nθ₁ = (1 * λ) / a\nθ₂ = (2 * λ) / a\n\nNext, we will convert the angular positions to linear positions on the screen using the small-angle approximation:\n\ny₁ = L * θ₁\ny₂ = L * θ₂\n\nFinally, we will find the distance between the first and second bright fringes:\n\nΔy = y₂ - y₁\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nθ₁ = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)) = 3.25 * 10^(-6) rad\nθ₂ = (2 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)) = 6.5 * 10^(-6) rad\n\ny₁ = 2 * 3.25 * 10^(-6) = 6.5 * 10^(-6) m\ny₂ = 2 * 6.5 * 10^(-6) = 13 * 10^(-6) m\n\nΔy = 13 * 10^(-6) - 6.5 * 10^(-6) = 6.5 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen is 6.5 * 10^(-6) m or 6.5 µm."
