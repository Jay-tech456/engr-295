    "message_2": "The temperature of the Universe at an age of 380,000 years following the Big Bang, based on the observation of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), is approximately 3000 Kelvin (K).\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is the thermal radiation that fills the Universe and is a remnant of the early stages of the Universe. It is considered a strong piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang Theory. The CMBR was first discovered in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who later received the Nobel Prize for their discovery.\n\nThe temperature of the CMBR supports the Big Bang Theory and the concept of an expanding Universe in several ways:\n\n1. The CMBR has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which means that its temperature is the same in all directions. This uniformity is consistent with the idea that the Universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n2. The temperature of the CMBR decreases as the Universe expands. This is because the expansion of the Universe stretches the wavelengths of the CMBR photons, causing them to lose energy and cool down. The current temperature of the CMBR is about 2.7 K, which is consistent with the predicted cooling of the Universe over time.\n\n3. The temperature fluctuations in the CMBR provide information about the density fluctuations in the early Universe. These fluctuations are believed to have led to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the Universe. The observed temperature fluctuations in the CMBR are consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang Theory and the inflationary model of the early Universe.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the Universe at an age of 380,000 years following the Big Bang, based on the observation of cosmic microwave background radiation, is approximately 3000 K. This temperature, along with other properties of the CMBR, supports the Big Bang Theory and the concept of an expanding Universe."
