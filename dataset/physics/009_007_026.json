    "message_1": "A concave lens has a focal length of -10 cm. If an object is placed 5 cm away from the lens, what will be the image distance and image magnification?",
    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is -10 cm and the object distance (u) is 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/5 + 1/v\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n-1/10 = 1/5 + 1/v\n-1/10 - 1/5 = 1/v\n-1/10 - 2/10 = 1/v\n-3/10 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = -10/3 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is -10/3 cm, which means the image is formed 10/3 cm in front of the lens (since it's a virtual image).\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlug in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -(-10/3) / 5\nM = (10/3) / 5\nM = 10/15\n\nM = 2/3\n\nThe image magnification is 2/3, which means the image is 2/3 the size of the object and is erect (since the magnification is positive)."
