    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of sucrose in the solution, we'll first need to find the molality of the solution and the mole fraction of sucrose and water. Then, we'll use the Raoult's law to find the activity coefficient.\n\n1. Calculate the molality of the solution:\nMolality (m) = moles of solute / mass of solvent (in kg)\n\nFirst, we need to find the moles of sucrose:\nMolar mass of sucrose (C12H22O11) = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.01) + (11 * 16.00) = 144.12 + 22.22 + 176.00 = 342.34 g/mol\n\nMoles of sucrose = mass / molar mass = 50 g / 342.34 g/mol = 0.146 moles\n\nNow, we can find the molality:\nMass of water = 500 mL * 1 g/mL = 500 g = 0.5 kg\nMolality (m) = 0.146 moles / 0.5 kg = 0.292 mol/kg\n\n2. Calculate the mole fraction of sucrose and water:\nMole fraction (X) = moles of component / total moles\n\nMoles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water = 500 g / 18.02 g/mol = 27.75 moles\n\nTotal moles = moles of sucrose + moles of water = 0.146 + 27.75 = 27.896 moles\n\nMole fraction of sucrose (Xs) = 0.146 / 27.896 = 0.00523\nMole fraction of water (Xw) = 27.75 / 27.896 = 0.99477\n\n3. Use Raoult's law to find the activity coefficient:\nRaoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the product of the mole fraction of the solvent and the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.\n\nVapor pressure of the solution (Psol) = Xw * Vapor pressure of pure water (Pw)\n\nWe are given the vapor pressure of the solution (Psol) as 21.5 mmHg and the vapor pressure of pure water (Pw) as 23.8 mmHg.\n\n21.5 = 0.99477 * 23.8 * activity coefficient (γ)\n\nNow, we can solve for the activity coefficient (γ):\nγ = 21.5 / (0.99477 * 23.8) = 0.909\n\nThe activity coefficient of sucrose in the solution is approximately 0.909."
