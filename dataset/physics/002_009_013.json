    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat required to convert 5 kg of ice at -10°C to 5 kg of water at 0°C, we need to consider two steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nTo calculate the heat required for this step, we use the formula:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q1 is the heat required, m is the mass of the ice, c is the specific heat capacity of ice, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.1 J/(g°C). Since we have 5 kg of ice, we need to convert it to grams:\n\nmass (m) = 5 kg × 1000 g/kg = 5000 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required for this step:\n\nΔT = 0°C - (-10°C) = 10°C\n\nQ1 = (5000 g)(2.1 J/g°C)(10°C) = 105,000 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C\nTo calculate the heat required for this step, we use the formula:\n\nQ2 = mL\n\nwhere Q2 is the heat required, m is the mass of the ice, and L is the latent heat of fusion of ice.\n\nThe latent heat of fusion of ice is given as 334 J/g. We already have the mass of the ice in grams (5000 g), so we can calculate the heat required for this step:\n\nQ2 = (5000 g)(334 J/g) = 1,670,000 J\n\nNow, we can find the total heat required by adding the heat required for both steps:\n\nTotal heat (Q) = Q1 + Q2 = 105,000 J + 1,670,000 J = 1,775,000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to convert 5 kg of ice at -10°C to 5 kg of water at 0°C is 1,775,000 J."
