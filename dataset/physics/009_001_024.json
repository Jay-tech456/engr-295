    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this problem, n1 (air) = 1, n2 (glass) = 1.5, and θ1 = 30 degrees. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5 (since sine of 30 degrees is 0.5)\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) = 1/3\n\nTo find θ2, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(1/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction of the light ray as it passes through the glass block is approximately 19.47 degrees."
