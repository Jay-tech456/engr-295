    "message_2": "To find the dispersion relation of phonons in a one-dimensional crystal lattice with N atoms, we can start by considering a linear chain with nearest-neighbor interactions only and periodic boundary conditions. Let's denote the mass of each atom as m, the distance between neighboring atoms as a, and the force constant between nearest neighbors as k.\n\nWe can write the equation of motion for the nth atom as:\n\nm * d²u_n/dt² = k * (u_(n+1) - 2u_n + u_(n-1))\n\nwhere u_n is the displacement of the nth atom from its equilibrium position.\n\nNow, we can apply the periodic boundary conditions, which state that u_(n+N) = u_n. We can then assume a solution of the form:\n\nu_n(t) = U * exp(i(kx_na - ωt))\n\nwhere U is the amplitude, kx is the wave vector, and ω is the angular frequency. Substituting this solution into the equation of motion, we get:\n\n-ω² * m * U * exp(i(kx_na - ωt)) = k * U * [exp(i(kx_n+1)a - ωt) - 2 * exp(i(kx_na - ωt)) + exp(i(kx_n-1)a - ωt)]\n\nDividing both sides by U * exp(i(kx_na - ωt)), we obtain the dispersion relation:\n\n-ω² * m = k * (exp(ikxa) - 2 + exp(-ikxa))\n\nSimplifying the equation using the identity 2*cos(kxa) = exp(ikxa) + exp(-ikxa), we get:\n\nω² = (2k/m) * (1 - cos(kxa))\n\nNow, let's find the frequency of the acoustic and optical phonon modes at the edge of the first Brillouin zone. The first Brillouin zone in a one-dimensional lattice is defined by the wave vector kx in the range:\n\n-π/a ≤ kx ≤ π/a\n\nAt the edge of the first Brillouin zone, kx = ±π/a. Substituting this value into the dispersion relation, we get:\n\nω² = (2k/m) * (1 - cos(±π))\n\nSince cos(±π) = -1, the equation becomes:\n\nω² = (4k/m)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find the frequency of the acoustic and optical phonon modes at the edge of the first Brillouin zone:\n\nω = 2 * sqrt(k/m)"
