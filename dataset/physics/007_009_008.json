    "message_2": "The most efficient isotope separation method for enriching uranium-235 from natural uranium is Gas Centrifugation. In this method, uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6) is fed into a series of rapidly rotating centrifuges. Due to the slight difference in mass between U-235 and U-238 isotopes, the lighter U-235 isotopes are concentrated towards the center of the centrifuge, while the heavier U-238 isotopes are pushed towards the outer walls. The enriched UF6 gas is then extracted and further processed.\n\nThe enrichment factor for gas centrifugation depends on various factors such as the centrifuge design, operating conditions, and the number of centrifuges used in a cascade. In general, the enrichment factor for a single centrifuge can range from 1.3 to 2.0. However, by using multiple centrifuges in a cascade configuration, the overall enrichment factor can be significantly increased, allowing for the production of highly enriched uranium."
