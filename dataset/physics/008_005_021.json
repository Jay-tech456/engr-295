    "message_2": "The mechanism responsible for the confinement of quarks inside a hadron, such as a proton or neutron, is known as the strong nuclear force or the strong interaction. This force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, and it is mediated by the exchange of particles called gluons. The strong force acts between quarks, which are the fundamental constituents of protons, neutrons, and other hadrons.\n\nThe strong force is described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is a component of the Standard Model of particle physics. In QCD, quarks carry a property called color charge, which comes in three types: red, green, and blue. The color charge is analogous to the electric charge in electromagnetism, but it is unrelated to the concept of color in everyday language.\n\nGluons, the mediator particles of the strong force, also carry color charge. They can be thought of as \"color-charged\" particles that can change the color of quarks when they interact with them. The strong force is attractive between quarks with different color charges and repulsive between quarks with the same color charge. This ensures that quarks inside a hadron are always in a \"color-neutral\" state, meaning the net color charge of the hadron is zero. For example, a proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark, with one quark of each color (red, green, and blue).\n\nThe confinement of quarks inside hadrons is a direct consequence of the unique properties of the strong force. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which decreases in strength as the distance between charged particles increases, the strong force exhibits a phenomenon called \"asymptotic freedom.\" This means that the strong force becomes weaker at very short distances (i.e., when quarks are close together) and stronger at larger distances (i.e., when quarks try to separate).\n\nAs a result, when quarks attempt to separate from one another, the strong force between them increases, making it energetically unfavorable for them to separate. In fact, the energy required to separate quarks becomes so large that it is more likely to create new quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum, which then bind with the original quarks to form new hadrons. This is why quarks are never observed as free particles in nature and are always confined within hadrons.\n\nIn summary, the confinement of quarks inside hadrons is due to the strong force, which is described by Quantum Chromodynamics. The unique properties of the strong force, such as asymptotic freedom and color charge, ensure that quarks remain bound together inside hadrons and are not observed as free particles in nature."
