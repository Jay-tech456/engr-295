    "message_2": "The thermal conductivity of amorphous solids, such as glasses, typically depends on temperature in a different way than crystalline materials. In general, the thermal conductivity of amorphous materials is lower than that of their crystalline counterparts due to the lack of long-range order and the presence of more defects in their structure.\n\nIn amorphous solids, the thermal conductivity (k) is mainly governed by the vibrational modes of the atoms or molecules, which are also known as phonons. The dependence of thermal conductivity on temperature in amorphous solids can be described by the following relation:\n\nk ∝ T^n\n\nwhere T is the temperature and n is an exponent that depends on the specific material and its temperature range. For glasses, the exponent n is typically between 1 and 2, which means that the thermal conductivity increases with temperature, but at a slower rate than in crystalline materials.\n\nIn crystalline materials, the thermal conductivity also depends on the phonons, but the long-range order and periodicity of the lattice structure allow for more efficient heat transfer. The dependence of thermal conductivity on temperature in crystalline materials can be described by the following relation:\n\nk ∝ T^m\n\nwhere m is an exponent that depends on the specific material and its temperature range. For most crystalline materials, the exponent m is close to 1 at low temperatures (in the so-called \"Debye regime\") and approaches 0 at high temperatures (in the \"Umklapp regime\"). This means that the thermal conductivity of crystalline materials increases linearly with temperature at low temperatures and becomes almost independent of temperature at high temperatures.\n\nIn summary, the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids, such as glasses, generally increases with temperature but at a slower rate than in crystalline materials. The lack of long-range order and the presence of defects in amorphous materials lead to lower thermal conductivity compared to their crystalline counterparts."
