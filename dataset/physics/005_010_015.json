Assuming the star emits light in all directions, what angle (in degrees) does the light appear to an observer in the spaceship? Use the formula for relativistic aberration of light to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle at which the light appears to an observer in the spaceship, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ)))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the direction of the spaceship's motion and the direction of the incoming light in the stationary frame, θ' is the angle between the direction of the spaceship's motion and the direction of the incoming light in the moving frame (the angle we want to find), v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the star (0.6c), c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nLet's assume that the spaceship is moving directly towards the star, so θ = 0 degrees. In this case, cos(θ) = 1.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula for relativistic aberration of light:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(0) / (1.25(1 + (0.6c/c)(1))) = 0 / (1.25(1 + 0.6)) = 0 / (1.25 * 1.6)\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, sin(θ') = 0, which means that θ' = 0 degrees.\n\nSo, the light appears to be coming directly from the front (0 degrees) to an observer in the spaceship."
