    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction at 298 K, we can use the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) and the equilibrium constant, which is given by the following equation:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the equilibrium constant.\n\nFirst, we need to convert ΔG° from kJ/mol to J/mol:\n\nΔG° = -36.4 kJ/mol × (1000 J/1 kJ) = -36400 J/mol\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for K:\n\nln(K) = -ΔG° / (RT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nln(K) = -(-36400 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × 298 K)\n\nln(K) ≈ 14.77\n\nNow, we can find K by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nK = e^(14.77) ≈ 2.6 × 10^6\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction at 298 K is approximately 2.6 × 10^6."
