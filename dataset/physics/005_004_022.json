    "message_2": "First, let's find the rest energy of the electron using the famous equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nMass of electron (m) = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg\nSpeed of light (c) = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nRest energy (E) = m * c^2\nE = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 8.19 x 10^-14 Joules\n\nNow, let's find the energy required to accelerate the electron to 95% of the speed of light. To do this, we need to use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = (mc^2) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the mass, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the electron.\n\nVelocity of electron (v) = 0.95 * c = 0.95 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.85 x 10^8 m/s\n\nE = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) / sqrt(1 - (2.85 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nE ≈ 2.44 x 10^-13 Joules\n\nThe energy required to accelerate the electron to 95% of the speed of light is the difference between the total energy and the rest energy:\n\nEnergy required = 2.44 x 10^-13 Joules - 8.19 x 10^-14 Joules ≈ 1.62 x 10^-13 Joules\n\nFinally, let's calculate the relativistic momentum of the electron at this velocity using the equation:\n\np = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere p is the relativistic momentum, m is the mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\np = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg * 2.85 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - (2.85 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\np ≈ 2.77 x 10^-22 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the electron at 95% of the speed of light is approximately 2.77 x 10^-22 kg m/s."
