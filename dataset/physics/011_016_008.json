    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility of a pure copper wire, we can use the Pauli paramagnetism formula, which is given by:\n\nχ = (μ₀ * μ_B² * N * Z) / (3 * k_B * T)\n\nwhere:\nχ is the magnetic susceptibility\nμ₀ is the vacuum permeability (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\nμ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T)\nN is the number of conduction electrons per unit volume\nZ is the number of valence electrons per atom\nk_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\nT is the temperature in Kelvin (300 K)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of conduction electrons per unit volume (N). To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nN = (ρ * N_A * Z) / M\n\nwhere:\nρ is the density of copper (8.96 g/cm³)\nN_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol)\nZ is the number of valence electrons per atom (1 for copper)\nM is the molar mass of copper (63.546 g/mol)\n\nN = (8.96 * 6.022 × 10²³ * 1) / 63.546\nN ≈ 8.49 × 10²⁸ electrons/m³\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ * (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴)² * 8.49 × 10²⁸ * 1) / (3 * 1.381 × 10⁻²³ * 300)\nχ ≈ 1.26 × 10⁻⁵\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of a pure copper wire at 300 K is approximately 1.26 × 10⁻⁵."
