    "message_2": "The mass of the Higgs boson, according to the latest research data, is approximately 125.1 GeV/c² (gigaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared). This value was determined through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\n\nWhen comparing the mass of the Higgs boson to other elementary particles, it is significantly heavier. For instance, the mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV/c² (megaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared), and the mass of the top quark, which is the heaviest known elementary particle, is around 173.1 GeV/c². The Higgs boson is heavier than other elementary particles like quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons (except for the top quark), but it is lighter than some composite particles like protons and neutrons."
