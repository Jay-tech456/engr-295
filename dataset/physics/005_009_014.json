    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at a constant velocity towards Earth at 0.6c, while emitting a radio signal with a frequency of 10 MHz. If the frequency detected on Earth is 7 MHz, what is the velocity of the Earth relative to the spaceship? (Using the Relativistic Doppler Effect equation)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Relativistic Doppler Effect equation:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency detected on Earth (7 MHz), f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship (10 MHz), v is the relative velocity between the Earth and the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given that the spaceship is moving towards Earth at 0.6c, and we want to find the velocity of the Earth relative to the spaceship. Let's denote the velocity of the Earth relative to the spaceship as v_E. Then, the total relative velocity v is given by:\n\nv = 0.6c - v_E\n\nNow, we can plug this into the Relativistic Doppler Effect equation:\n\n7 MHz = 10 MHz * sqrt((1 - (0.6c - v_E)/c) / (1 + (0.6c - v_E)/c))\n\nDivide both sides by 10 MHz:\n\n0.7 = sqrt((1 - (0.6 - v_E)) / (1 + (0.6 - v_E)))\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n0.49 = (1 - (0.6 - v_E)) / (1 + (0.6 - v_E))\n\nNow, solve for v_E:\n\n0.49 * (1 + (0.6 - v_E)) = 1 - (0.6 - v_E)\n\n0.49 + 0.49 * (0.6 - v_E) = 1 - 0.6 + v_E\n\n0.49 + 0.294 - 0.49 * v_E = 0.4 + v_E\n\nCombine terms:\n\n0.784 = 1.49 * v_E\n\nNow, divide by 1.49:\n\nv_E â‰ˆ 0.526\n\nSo, the velocity of the Earth relative to the spaceship is approximately 0.526c."
