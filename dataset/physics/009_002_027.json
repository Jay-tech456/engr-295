    "message_1": "A ray of light is traveling in air and strikes a flat piece of glass with an angle of incidence of 45 degrees. If the index of refraction for air is 1.00 and for glass is 1.52, what is the angle of refraction?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nn1 = 1.00 (air)\nn2 = 1.52 (glass)\nθ1 = 45 degrees\n\nWe want to find θ2. Plugging the given values into Snell's Law:\n\n1.00 * sin(45) = 1.52 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\n0.7071 = 1.52 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.7071 / 1.52\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.4651\n\nTo find θ2, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.4651:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4651)\nθ2 ≈ 27.8 degrees (rounded to 1 decimal place)\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 27.8 degrees."
