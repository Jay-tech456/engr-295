    "message_2": "To calculate the expected energy range for the detection of WIMP-nucleus interactions, we need to consider the kinematics of the scattering process. The maximum energy transfer in a WIMP-nucleus interaction can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nE_max = (2 * μ² * v²) / M_N\n\nwhere E_max is the maximum energy transfer, μ is the reduced mass of the WIMP-nucleus system, v is the WIMP velocity, and M_N is the mass of the nucleus.\n\nThe reduced mass μ can be calculated as:\n\nμ = (m_WIMP * M_N) / (m_WIMP + M_N)\n\nwhere m_WIMP is the mass of the WIMP (100 GeV/c²) and M_N is the mass of the nucleus. Let's assume we are using a Xenon-based detector, which has a mass of approximately 131 GeV/c².\n\nμ = (100 * 131) / (100 + 131) ≈ 56.4 GeV/c²\n\nThe WIMP velocity v can be estimated as the average velocity of WIMPs in the galactic halo, which is around 220 km/s or 7.3 x 10⁻⁴ c (where c is the speed of light).\n\nNow we can calculate E_max:\n\nE_max = (2 * (56.4)^2 * (7.3 x 10⁻⁴)^2) / 131 ≈ 6.8 x 10⁻⁶ GeV\n\nThis is the maximum energy transfer in the WIMP-nucleus interaction, which is about 6.8 keV. The expected energy range for the detection of WIMP-nucleus interactions in a typical underground dark matter experiment would be from a few keV to several tens of keV.\n\nNow let's calculate the expected rate of WIMP-nucleus scattering in such an experiment. The differential event rate per unit detector mass can be expressed as:\n\ndR/dE = (ρ₀ * σ₀ * N_A * A) / (2 * m_WIMP * μ²) * F²(E) * v\n\nwhere ρ₀ is the local density of dark matter (0.3 GeV/cm³), σ₀ is the WIMP-nucleon cross section (10⁻⁴ pb), N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹), A is the atomic mass of the target nucleus (131 for Xenon), F(E) is the nuclear form factor, and v is the WIMP velocity.\n\nThe nuclear form factor F(E) accounts for the loss of coherence in the scattering process at higher momentum transfers. For simplicity, we will assume F(E) = 1, which is a reasonable approximation for low-energy interactions.\n\nNow we can calculate the differential event rate:\n\ndR/dE = (0.3 * 10⁻⁴ * 6.022 x 10²³ * 131) / (2 * 100 * 56.4²) * (7.3 x 10⁻⁴)\n\ndR/dE ≈ 1.5 x 10⁻⁶ events/(keV kg day)\n\nThis is the expected rate of WIMP-nucleus scattering in a typical underground dark matter experiment. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual rate may vary depending on the specific experimental setup and background noise."
