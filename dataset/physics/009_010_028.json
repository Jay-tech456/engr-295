    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image, we first need to determine the image distance (di) using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (do) is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n2/20 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 1/20 from both sides:\n\n1/di = 2/20 - 1/20\n1/di = 1/20\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 20 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -20/20\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted (upside down)."
