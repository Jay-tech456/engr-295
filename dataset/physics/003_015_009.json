    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop lies in the xy-plane, we can break the problem into four segments, one for each side of the square. Let's label the sides as follows: Side 1 goes from the origin to (0.15, 0), Side 2 goes from (0.15, 0) to (0.15, 0.15), Side 3 goes from (0.15, 0.15) to (0, 0.15), and Side 4 goes from (0, 0.15) to the origin.\n\nThe center of the square is at the point (0.075, 0.075). We will calculate the magnetic field due to each side at this point and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field.\n\nFor Side 1:\nThe differential length vector dl = (dx, 0, 0), and the position vector r = (0.075 - x, 0.075, 0). The cross product dl x r = (0, 0, 0.075dx). Integrating over the length of Side 1 (from x = 0 to x = 0.15), we get:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(0, 0, 0.075dx) / (0.075² + x²)^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 0.15\n\nFor Side 2:\nThe differential length vector dl = (0, dy, 0), and the position vector r = (0.075, 0.075 - y, 0). The cross product dl x r = (0, 0, -0.075dy). Integrating over the length of Side 2 (from y = 0 to y = 0.15), we get:\n\nB₂ = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(0, 0, -0.075dy) / (0.075² + y²)^(3/2) from y = 0 to y = 0.15\n\nFor Side 3:\nThe differential length vector dl = (-dx, 0, 0), and the position vector r = (0.075 - x, -0.075, 0). The cross product dl x r = (0, 0, -0.075dx). Integrating over the length of Side 3 (from x = 0.15 to x = 0), we get:\n\nB₃ = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(0, 0, -0.075dx) / (0.075² + x²)^(3/2) from x = 0.15 to x = 0\n\nFor Side 4:\nThe differential length vector dl = (0, -dy, 0), and the position vector r = (-0.075, 0.075 - y, 0). The cross product dl x r = (0, 0, 0.075dy). Integrating over the length of Side 4 (from y = 0.15 to y = 0), we get:\n\nB₄ = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(0, 0, 0.075dy) / (0.075² + y²)^(3/2) from y = 0.15 to y = 0\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each side:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetric, we can simplify the calculation by noting that B₁ = -B₃ and B₂ = -B₄. Therefore, B_total = 2 * (B₁ + B₂).\n\nUsing a numerical integration tool (such as Wolfram Alpha or a calculator with integration capabilities), we can evaluate the integrals:\n\nB₁ = 1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ T\nB₂ = -1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nB_total = 2 * (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ T - 1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ T) = 0 T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 0 T."
