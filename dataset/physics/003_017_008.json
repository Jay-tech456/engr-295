    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a regular hexagon with sides of length \"a\" carrying a current \"I\", we can use Ampere's Law and the principle of superposition. \n\nFirst, let's consider the magnetic field produced by one side of the hexagon. The hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, and the angle between the side and the line connecting the center of the hexagon to the midpoint of the side is 30 degrees (π/6 radians). \n\nUsing Ampere's Law, the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current \"I\" at a perpendicular distance \"r\" from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nFor the hexagon, the perpendicular distance \"r\" from the center to the midpoint of a side is:\n\nr = (a/2) / sin(π/6) = a / √3\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field produced by one side of the hexagon at the center:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * (a / √3))\n\nSince there are six sides, and the magnetic field produced by each side is perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon, we can use the principle of superposition to find the total magnetic field at the center. The angle between the magnetic fields produced by adjacent sides is 60 degrees (π/3 radians), so we can use vector addition to find the total magnetic field:\n\nB_total = 6 * B₁ * cos(π/6)\n\nB_total = 6 * [(μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * (a / √3))] * (1/2)\n\nB_total = 3 * (μ₀ * I) / (π * a / √3)\n\nB_total = (3 * √3 * μ₀ * I) / (π * a)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of a regular hexagon with sides of length \"a\" carrying a current \"I\" is:\n\nB_total = (3 * √3 * μ₀ * I) / (π * a)"
