    "message_2": "The estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 13.6 billion years, based on the analysis of its stellar populations. This age estimate has been determined through several methods, including:\n\n1. Globular Clusters: These are dense groups of stars that orbit the Milky Way galaxy. The ages of the oldest globular clusters provide a lower limit for the age of the Milky Way. By studying the color-magnitude diagrams of these clusters and comparing them to theoretical models of stellar evolution, astronomers can estimate their ages. The oldest globular clusters in the Milky Way are found to be around 12.5 to 13 billion years old.\n\n2. White Dwarfs: These are the remnants of low-mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. The cooling rate of white dwarfs can be used to estimate their ages. The oldest white dwarfs in the Milky Way have been found to be around 12 to 13 billion years old.\n\n3. Nucleocosmochronology: This method involves studying the abundances of radioactive isotopes in old stars and comparing them to their stable decay products. The decay rates of these isotopes provide a \"cosmic clock\" that can be used to estimate the age of the Milky Way. For example, the decay of uranium-238 to lead-206 has been used to estimate the age of the galaxy to be around 13.6 billion years.\n\n4. The age of the Universe: The age of the Milky Way cannot be older than the age of the Universe itself. The age of the Universe, as determined by the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion rate of the Universe, is approximately 13.8 billion years. This provides an upper limit for the age of the Milky Way.\n\nBy combining these different methods, astronomers have estimated the age of the Milky Way to be around 13.6 billion years."
