    "message_2": "The mass and composition of a star play crucial roles in determining the ultimate outcome of its gravitational collapse. The life cycle of a star can be broadly divided into three stages: the main sequence, the post-main sequence, and the final state. The final state of a star depends on its initial mass and composition, which determine the nuclear reactions that occur within the star and the forces that counteract its gravitational collapse.\n\n1. Low-mass stars (less than 0.5 solar masses): These stars have low core temperatures and primarily burn hydrogen through the proton-proton chain. Due to their low mass, they do not have enough gravitational pressure to ignite helium fusion. When they exhaust their hydrogen fuel, they become white dwarfs, supported by electron degeneracy pressure.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass stars (0.5 to 8 solar masses): These stars burn hydrogen through the CNO cycle and eventually start helium fusion in their cores. As they exhaust their nuclear fuel, they expand into red giants and lose their outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The core left behind becomes a white dwarf, supported by electron degeneracy pressure.\n\n3. Massive stars (greater than 8 solar masses): These stars have high core temperatures and burn hydrogen through the CNO cycle. They also undergo successive stages of nuclear fusion, burning helium, carbon, oxygen, and other elements up to iron. When the core reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support it against gravitational collapse.\n\nAt this point, the outcome depends on the core's mass:\n\na) If the core's mass is between 1.4 and 3 solar masses, it collapses into a neutron star. Neutron degeneracy pressure and the strong nuclear force prevent further collapse. Neutron stars are incredibly dense and have strong magnetic fields.\n\nb) If the core's mass is greater than 3 solar masses, it collapses into a black hole. In this case, no known force can counteract the gravitational collapse, and the core's matter is compressed into a singularity. The black hole is characterized by its event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull.\n\nIn summary, the mass and composition of a star determine the nuclear reactions that occur within it and the forces that counteract its gravitational collapse. Low-mass stars become white dwarfs, intermediate-mass stars also become white dwarfs after shedding their outer layers, and massive stars either become neutron stars or black holes, depending on their core mass."
