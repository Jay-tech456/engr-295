    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the binding reaction of a protein and ligand at physiological conditions, we need the equilibrium constant (Kd) and the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°). However, you have not provided the values for Kd and ΔH°. \n\nOnce you provide the values for Kd and ΔH°, we can use the following equations to calculate ΔG°:\n\n1. ΔG° = -RT ln(Ka) , where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (usually 298K for physiological conditions), and Ka is the association constant (Ka = 1/Kd).\n\n2. We can also use the relationship between ΔG°, ΔH°, and the standard entropy change (ΔS°): ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. However, we would need the value of ΔS° to use this equation.\n\nPlease provide the values for Kd and ΔH°, and if available, ΔS°, so we can calculate ΔG° for the binding reaction."
