    "message_2": "According to General Relativity, a star can undergo a gravitational collapse and become a black hole if its mass is compressed within a certain volume, defined by the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light.\n\nHowever, there is no strict minimum mass required for a star to become a black hole in General Relativity. In practice, the minimum mass required for a star to undergo a gravitational collapse and form a black hole is determined by the balance between the outward pressure forces (e.g., radiation pressure, electron degeneracy pressure) and the inward gravitational forces.\n\nFor a star to undergo a gravitational collapse and form a black hole, it must be massive enough that its core cannot be supported by these outward pressure forces. This typically occurs in stars with initial masses greater than about 20 solar masses. After undergoing supernova explosions, these massive stars can leave behind a core with a mass greater than 2-3 solar masses, which is the minimum mass required for the core to collapse into a black hole under the influence of gravity. This minimum mass is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit.\n\nIt is important to note that the TOV limit is derived from the equations of state for neutron stars, which are based on our current understanding of nuclear physics. If our understanding of nuclear physics changes, the TOV limit could also change."
