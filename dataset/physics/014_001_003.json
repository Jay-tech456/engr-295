    "message_2": "The current scientific understanding of dark matter and dark energy is still limited, but they are thought to be key components of the universe that significantly influence its large-scale structure and expansion.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other detection methods that rely on light. It is estimated to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nDark matter is believed to be composed of yet-to-be-discovered subatomic particles, with some of the leading candidates being Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions. These particles are thought to only interact through gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force, making them extremely difficult to detect.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that makes up about 68% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but it is often described as a property of space itself or as a new type of energy field.\n\nThe effects of dark matter and dark energy on the large-scale structure and expansion of the universe are significant. Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, causing these structures to move away from each other at an ever-increasing rate.\n\nIn summary, our current understanding of dark matter and dark energy is limited, but they are believed to play crucial roles in shaping the large-scale structure and expansion of the universe. Ongoing research and experiments aim to uncover more about their nature and properties, which could lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental workings of the cosmos."
