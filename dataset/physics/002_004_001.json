    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the bond dissociation energies and the standard enthalpy of formation for water vapor. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants:\n\nEnergy to break H-H bonds in 2 moles of H2 = 2 moles × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ\nEnergy to break O-O bond in 1 mole of O2 = 1 mole × 498 kJ/mol = 498 kJ\n\nTotal energy required to break bonds in reactants = 872 kJ + 498 kJ = 1370 kJ\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy released when the new bonds are formed in the products:\n\nEnergy released when forming H-O bonds in 2 moles of H2O = 2 moles × 2 (H-O bonds per H2O) × 463 kJ/mol = 1852 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Energy released when forming bonds in products - Energy required to break bonds in reactants\nΔH = 1852 kJ - 1370 kJ = 482 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction between 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce 2 moles of water vapor is 482 kJ."
