    "message_1": "A toroidal solenoid has 400 turns and a magnetic field of 0.2 T. What is the total magnetic flux inside the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the total magnetic flux inside the toroid, we can use the formula for the magnetic flux through a solenoid:\n\nΦ = N * B * A\n\nwhere Φ is the magnetic flux, N is the number of turns, B is the magnetic field, and A is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid.\n\nHowever, in the case of a toroidal solenoid, the magnetic field is confined within the toroid, and there is no magnetic field outside the toroid. Therefore, the total magnetic flux inside the toroid is zero."
