    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the force required to lift the weight and then compare it to the maximum tension that the biceps muscle can generate.\n\nFirst, let's find the force required to lift the weight. The weight of the object (W) can be calculated using the equation:\n\nW = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object (50 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nW = 50 kg * 9.81 m/s²\nW ≈ 490.5 N\n\nNow, let's find the maximum force that the biceps muscle can generate. The maximum force (F_max) can be calculated using the equation:\n\nF_max = T_max * A\n\nwhere T_max is the maximum tension (400 N/cm²) and A is the cross-sectional area of the muscle. Since we don't have the cross-sectional area of the muscle, we cannot calculate the maximum force that the biceps muscle can generate.\n\nHowever, we can still compare the required force to lift the weight (490.5 N) with the maximum tension that the muscle fibers can generate (400 N/cm²). If the cross-sectional area of the muscle is large enough, the biceps muscle can generate enough force to lift the weight. If not, the muscle will not be able to lift the weight.\n\nIn conclusion, we need more information about the cross-sectional area of the biceps muscle to determine if it can generate enough force to lift the 50 kg weight."
