    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05m from the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current (4 A)\nR is the radius of the loop (0.1 m)\nx is the distance from the center of the loop (0.05 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * 0.02795084971 m³)\n\nB ≈ 3.59 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05m from the center of the loop is approximately 3.59 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
