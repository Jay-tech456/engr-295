    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of a graphene sheet can be calculated using the Drude model, which is a classical model for electronic transport in metals and semiconductors. The Drude model is given by the following equation:\n\nσ = n * e^2 * τ / m\n\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the charge carrier density, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), τ is the relaxation time, and m is the effective mass of the charge carriers.\n\nFor graphene, the charge carrier density (n) is approximately 10^16 m^-2, and the effective mass (m) is nearly zero due to the linear dispersion relation of the electronic bands near the Dirac points. The relaxation time (τ) is typically on the order of 10^-13 s.\n\nTo analyze the behavior of the electrical conductivity as a function of temperature, we need to consider the temperature dependence of the relaxation time (τ). In graphene, the dominant scattering mechanisms are electron-phonon scattering and impurity scattering. At low temperatures, impurity scattering dominates, and the relaxation time is temperature-independent. At high temperatures, electron-phonon scattering becomes dominant, and the relaxation time decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nTo calculate the electrical conductivity at various temperatures, we can use the following temperature-dependent relaxation time:\n\nτ(T) = τ0 / (1 + (T / T0)^α)\n\nwhere τ0 is the relaxation time at T = 0 K, T0 is a characteristic temperature, and α is an exponent that depends on the scattering mechanism. For electron-phonon scattering in graphene, α is typically around 4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the electrical conductivity at different temperatures using the Drude model with the temperature-dependent relaxation time:\n\nσ(T) = n * e^2 * τ(T) / m\n\nSince the effective mass (m) is nearly zero, the electrical conductivity of graphene is very high. However, as the temperature increases, the relaxation time (τ) decreases, leading to a decrease in electrical conductivity.\n\nTo plot the results, you can use a software like MATLAB or Python to calculate the electrical conductivity at different temperatures using the above equations and then create a plot of electrical conductivity versus temperature. The plot will show that the electrical conductivity of graphene decreases with increasing temperature due to the increasing dominance of electron-phonon scattering.\n\nIn conclusion, the electrical conductivity of a graphene sheet is very high due to its unique electronic transport properties, such as the nearly zero effective mass of charge carriers. However, the electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature due to the increasing dominance of electron-phonon scattering over impurity scattering."
