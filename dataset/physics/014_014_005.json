    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. They can interact with matter, including the Earth's atmosphere, and produce showers of secondary particles, known as air showers or extensive air showers (EAS).\n\nThe energy range of cosmic rays that can interact with matter and produce showers of secondary particles is quite broad, typically from around 10^9 eV (1 GeV) to over 10^21 eV (100 EeV). The lower-energy cosmic rays are more abundant, while the higher-energy ones are rarer but carry more energy per particle.\n\nThe properties of the primary cosmic rays, such as their energy, mass, and direction, affect the development of air showers in the Earth's atmosphere in several ways:\n\n1. Energy: The energy of the primary cosmic ray determines the number of secondary particles produced in the air shower. Higher-energy cosmic rays will produce more secondary particles, leading to a more extensive air shower. The energy also influences the depth in the atmosphere where the shower reaches its maximum development, known as the shower maximum (Xmax). Higher-energy showers typically have a deeper Xmax.\n\n2. Mass: The mass of the primary cosmic ray affects the development of the air shower because heavier particles (e.g., atomic nuclei) interact more strongly with the atmospheric nuclei than lighter particles (e.g., protons). As a result, showers initiated by heavier primary particles tend to have a larger number of secondary particles and a shallower Xmax compared to showers initiated by lighter primary particles with the same energy.\n\n3. Direction: The direction of the incoming cosmic ray influences the path length of the particle through the Earth's atmosphere and the geomagnetic field's effect on the charged secondary particles. Cosmic rays arriving from near the horizon have a longer path through the atmosphere, leading to a higher probability of interaction and a more extensive air shower. The geomagnetic field can also cause deflections of the charged secondary particles, affecting the lateral distribution of the air shower.\n\nIn summary, the energy range of cosmic rays that can interact with matter and produce showers of secondary particles is from about 10^9 eV to over 10^21 eV. The properties of the primary cosmic rays, such as their energy, mass, and direction, play a crucial role in determining the development of air showers in the Earth's atmosphere."
