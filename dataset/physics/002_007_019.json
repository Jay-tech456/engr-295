    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of gold, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat input (in joules), m is the mass (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following values:\nQ = 250 J\nm = 50 g\nΔT = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C\n\nWe need to find the value of c. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 250 J / (50 g × 30°C)\nc = 250 J / 1500 g°C\nc = 0.1667 J/g°C\n\nTherefore, the specific heat capacity of gold is approximately 0.1667 J/g°C."
