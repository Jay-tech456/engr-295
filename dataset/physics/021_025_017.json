    "message_2": "The probability of primordial black holes (PBHs) forming from the collapse of cosmic strings in the early universe is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among physicists. Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that may have formed during phase transitions in the early universe. They are incredibly dense and can stretch across vast cosmic distances.\n\nThe formation of PBHs from cosmic strings depends on several factors, including the density and distribution of cosmic strings, as well as the conditions in the early universe. Some theoretical studies suggest that the collapse of cosmic string loops could lead to the formation of PBHs, but the exact probability is still uncertain.\n\nAs for whether this mechanism could account for the observed number of black holes in our galaxy, it is also unclear. Observations of black holes in our galaxy are primarily based on stellar-mass black holes, which are formed from the collapse of massive stars. The contribution of PBHs to the overall black hole population is still uncertain, and it is not yet known whether PBHs formed from cosmic strings could significantly contribute to the observed number of black holes in our galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the probability of primordial black holes forming from the collapse of cosmic strings in the early universe is still uncertain, and it is not yet clear whether this mechanism could account for the observed number of black holes in our galaxy. Further research and observations are needed to better understand the role of cosmic strings and primordial black holes in the formation and evolution of black holes in the universe."
