    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the first-order maximum will appear in the diffraction pattern, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle of the maximum, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 4000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 4000 lines/cm = 1 / 40000 lines/m = 1 / 40000 m = 2.5 * 10^(-5) m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the grating equation:\n\n(2.5 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(θ) = (1) * (500 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nsin(θ) = (500 * 10^(-9) m) / (2.5 * 10^(-5) m)\n\nsin(θ) = 0.02\n\nθ = arcsin(0.02)\n\nθ ≈ 1.15°\n\nSo, the angle at which the first-order maximum will appear in the diffraction pattern is approximately 1.15 degrees."
