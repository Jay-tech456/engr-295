    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object is compressed within that sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. It is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe mass of the sun (Msun) is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Since the black hole has a mass 4 times larger than the sun, its mass (Mbh) is:\n\nMbh = 4 × Msun = 4 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 7.956 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius for the black hole:\n\nRs = (2 × 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 7.956 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 1.179 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass 4 times larger than the sun is approximately 11,790 meters or 11.79 kilometers."
