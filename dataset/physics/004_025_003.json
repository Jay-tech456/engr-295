    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and wavelength of gravitational waves generated by the coalescence of two primordial black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system.\n2. Calculate the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves.\n3. Calculate the wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system\n\nLet the masses of the two black holes be m1 = 30 M_sun and m2 = 50 M_sun, where M_sun is the solar mass (1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\nTotal mass, M = m1 + m2 = 30 M_sun + 50 M_sun = 80 M_sun\n\nReduced mass, μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (30 M_sun * 50 M_sun) / (30 M_sun + 50 M_sun) = 18.75 M_sun\n\nStep 2: Calculate the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves\n\nThe characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves during the coalescence of two black holes is given by the formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π * 8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the total mass of the system in kilograms.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total mass M from solar masses to kilograms:\n\nM = 80 M_sun = 80 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.5912 x 10^32 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the characteristic frequency:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.5912 x 10^32 kg * π * 8) ≈ 157.5 Hz\n\nStep 3: Calculate the wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves\n\nThe wavelength of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the formula:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / 157.5 Hz ≈ 1.905 x 10^6 m\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves generated by the coalescence of two primordial black holes with masses of 30 and 50 times that of the sun is approximately 157.5 Hz, and the expected wavelength is approximately 1.905 x 10^6 meters."
