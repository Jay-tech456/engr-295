    "message_2": "The properties of a black hole, such as its event horizon and Hawking radiation, are primarily determined by its mass. The radius of a black hole is directly related to its mass through the Schwarzschild radius formula. Let's analyze these relationships mathematically.\n\n1. Event Horizon:\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. The radius of the event horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the radius of the event horizon is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. As the mass increases, the event horizon's radius also increases, making the black hole \"larger\" in terms of its gravitational influence.\n\n2. Hawking Radiation:\n\nHawking radiation is the emission of particles from a black hole due to quantum effects near the event horizon. The temperature of the Hawking radiation (TH) is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole and is given by the formula:\n\nTH = ħc^3 / (8πGMkB)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 Js), kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K), and the other variables are as previously defined.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the temperature of the Hawking radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. As the mass of the black hole increases, the temperature of the Hawking radiation decreases. This means that more massive black holes emit less energetic Hawking radiation.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a black hole directly affects its properties, such as the event horizon and Hawking radiation. The radius of the event horizon is directly proportional to the mass, while the temperature of the Hawking radiation is inversely proportional to the mass."
