    "message_2": "Dark matter and dark photons are both hypothetical particles that have been proposed to explain certain observations in the universe that cannot be accounted for by the known particles and interactions in the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. It is believed to make up around 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of galaxies, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. The exact nature and composition of dark matter are still unknown, but it is thought to be composed of yet-to-be-discovered subatomic particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions.\n\nDark photons, on the other hand, are hypothetical particles that are similar to regular photons (particles of light) but do not interact with ordinary matter in the same way. They are also known as \"hidden sector\" or \"dark sector\" photons. Dark photons have been proposed as a possible force carrier for dark matter, mediating interactions between dark matter particles in a manner analogous to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force between charged particles.\n\nThe relationship between dark matter and dark photons is still a subject of ongoing research, as both particles have not been directly detected yet. If dark photons exist and mediate interactions between dark matter particles, they could help explain the observed distribution of dark matter in the universe and potentially provide a way to detect dark matter through their interactions with ordinary matter.\n\nAs for the contribution of dark photons to the overall mass of the universe, it is currently unclear. If dark photons have a non-zero mass, they could contribute to the overall mass-energy content of the universe. However, their contribution would likely be much smaller than that of dark matter, as dark matter is believed to be the dominant source of \"missing mass\" in the universe. Further experimental and theoretical research is needed to determine the exact role and properties of dark photons and their potential contribution to the mass of the universe."
