    "message_1": "A coaxial cable carries a current of 10 A. The inner and outer radii of the cable are 1 cm and 2 cm respectively. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 cm from the axis of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 cm from the axis of the cable, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetrical around the axis of the cable, we can simplify this equation for a circular loop of radius r:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to determine the current enclosed by the loop at a radial distance of 3 cm. Since the inner radius of the cable is 1 cm and the outer radius is 2 cm, the entire 10 A current is enclosed by the loop at 3 cm.\n\nSo, I_enclosed = 10 A.\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB * 2π(0.03 m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 10 A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2π * 0.03 m)\n\nB ≈ 6.67 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the axis of the cable), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in a circular pattern around the cable, with the direction depending on whether the current is flowing into or out of the cable.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 cm from the axis of the cable is approximately 6.67 × 10^(-6) T, and the direction is circular around the cable, with the direction depending on the direction of the current flow."
