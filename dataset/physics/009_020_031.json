    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 6000 lines per centimeter. Light is incident on the grating at an angle of 24 degrees. What is the angle between the first two orders of the bright fringes in the diffraction pattern?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the first two orders of the bright fringes in the diffraction pattern, we need to use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the fringe, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the grating lines, and θ is the angle of the diffracted light.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance between the grating lines (d). Since there are 6000 lines per centimeter, we can convert this to meters:\n\n6000 lines/cm * (1 cm / 10000 lines) = 0.0001 m/line\n\nSo, d = 0.0001 m.\n\nNow, let's find the angle for the first order (n = 1) and second order (n = 2) bright fringes. We can rearrange the grating equation to solve for θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(n * λ / d)\n\nSince we don't know the wavelength (λ), we can't find the exact angles for the first and second order bright fringes. However, we can find the difference between the angles for the two orders:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = arcsin(2 * λ / d) - arcsin(λ / d)\n\nTo find the angle between the first two orders of the bright fringes, we can plug in the values for d:\n\nΔθ = arcsin(2 * λ / 0.0001) - arcsin(λ / 0.0001)\n\nSince we don't know the wavelength (λ), we cannot find the exact angle between the first two orders of the bright fringes. However, we have the equation to find the angle difference if the wavelength is known:\n\nΔθ = arcsin(2 * λ / 0.0001) - arcsin(λ / 0.0001)"
