    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5mm from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. So, we can choose a circular loop of radius 5mm as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is constant along this path, so we can simplify the equation as:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular path, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = B * (2πr) = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the circular path of radius 5mm. Since the radius of the wire is 2mm, the entire current of 3A is enclosed within the circular path. So, I_enclosed = 3A.\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for B:\n\nB * (2πr) = μ₀I_enclosed\nB * (2π * 5 * 10^(-3)m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 3A\n\nB * (10π * 10^(-3)m) = 12π * 10^(-7) T\n\nDivide both sides by 10π * 10^(-3)m:\n\nB = (12π * 10^(-7) T) / (10π * 10^(-3)m)\n\nB = 1.2 * 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5mm from the center of the cylinder is 1.2 × 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
