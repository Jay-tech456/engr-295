    "message_2": "To obtain and validate the thermal neutron scattering data for a specific material, the researcher can follow these steps:\n\n1. Literature review: The researcher should start by reviewing the existing literature and published data on the material in question. This may include scientific articles, technical reports, and textbooks. The researcher should focus on finding information about the material's composition, structure, and previous experimental results related to neutron scattering.\n\n2. Consult nuclear data libraries: The researcher can consult established nuclear data libraries, such as the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF), the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion (JEFF) library, or the Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (JENDL). These libraries contain evaluated nuclear data for a wide range of materials and can provide valuable information on thermal neutron scattering cross-sections, as well as other relevant nuclear data.\n\n3. Perform experiments: If the available data is insufficient or outdated, the researcher may need to perform experiments to obtain the required thermal neutron scattering data. This can be done using neutron scattering facilities, such as research reactors or spallation neutron sources. The researcher should design the experiment to measure the material's neutron scattering cross-sections and other relevant parameters, such as the energy distribution of scattered neutrons.\n\n4. Data analysis and validation: After obtaining the experimental data, the researcher should analyze and validate the results. This may involve comparing the experimental data with theoretical predictions, such as those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations or ab initio calculations. The researcher should also compare the results with previously published data to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\n5. Uncertainty quantification: The researcher should quantify the uncertainties associated with the obtained thermal neutron scattering data. This includes both the experimental uncertainties and the uncertainties related to the data analysis and validation process. Proper uncertainty quantification is essential for the accurate design and safety analysis of nuclear reactors.\n\n6. Documentation and dissemination: Finally, the researcher should document the obtained data and the validation process in a clear and transparent manner. This may involve publishing the results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal or submitting the data to a nuclear data library. Sharing the validated data with the scientific community ensures that other researchers can benefit from the findings and contribute to the ongoing development of nuclear reactor technology."
