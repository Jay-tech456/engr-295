    "message_1": "A physics student is given a polarizer that transmits light with its polarization axis making an angle of 30 degrees with the vertical. The student then introduces a second polarizer in front of the first one so that its polarization axis makes an angle of 75 degrees with the vertical. \n\nWhat percentage of the originally transmitted light is now transmitted through the two polarizers according to Malus' Law?",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the polarization axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the polarization axes of the two polarizers is:\n\nθ = 75° - 30° = 45°\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the percentage of the originally transmitted light that is now transmitted through the two polarizers:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(45°)\n\nSince we want the percentage, we can divide I by I₀ and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage = (I / I₀) * 100 = (cos²(45°)) * 100\n\ncos(45°) = 1/√2, so cos²(45°) = 1/2\n\nPercentage = (1/2) * 100 = 50%\n\nSo, 50% of the originally transmitted light is now transmitted through the two polarizers."
