    "message_1": "A rectangular block of wood with dimensions 10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm is floating in water. Determine the density of the wood if its top surface is 5 cm above the water level. (Density of water = 1000 kg/m³)",
    "message_2": "To determine the density of the wood, we need to find the volume of the submerged part of the block and the mass of the block. Then we can use the formula for density:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the submerged part of the block. Since the top surface is 5 cm above the water level, the submerged part has a height of 30 cm - 5 cm = 25 cm. The dimensions of the submerged part are 10 cm x 20 cm x 25 cm.\n\nVolume_submerged = Length x Width x Height\nVolume_submerged = 10 cm x 20 cm x 25 cm\nVolume_submerged = 5000 cm³\n\nNow, let's convert the volume to meters cubed (m³) since the density of water is given in kg/m³.\n\n1 m³ = 100³ cm³\n5000 cm³ = 5000 / 100³ m³\n5000 cm³ = 0.005 m³\n\nNow, we can use Archimedes' principle to find the mass of the block. Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the block.\n\nBuoyant force = Weight of the block\nWeight of the block = Mass of the block x Gravity\n\nThe buoyant force is also equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the block.\n\nBuoyant force = Weight of displaced water\nWeight of displaced water = Mass of displaced water x Gravity\nMass of displaced water = Volume of displaced water x Density of water\n\nSince the volume of the submerged part of the block is equal to the volume of the displaced water, we can write:\n\nMass of displaced water = 0.005 m³ x 1000 kg/m³\nMass of displaced water = 5 kg\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the block.\n\nMass of the block = Mass of displaced water\nMass of the block = 5 kg\n\nFinally, we can find the density of the wood.\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\nDensity = 5 kg / 0.006 m³ (Note: The total volume of the block is 10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm = 6000 cm³ = 0.006 m³)\nDensity = 833.33 kg/m³\n\nThe density of the wood is approximately 833.33 kg/m³."
