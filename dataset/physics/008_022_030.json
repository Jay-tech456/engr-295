    "message_2": "To calculate the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle) in the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg (GSW) theory of electroweak interactions, we need to use the experimentally determined values of the Z boson mass (M_Z) and the Fermi constant (G_F). The weak mixing angle is denoted as θ_W.\n\nThe relationship between the weak mixing angle, the Z boson mass, and the Fermi constant is given by the following equation:\n\nsin^2(θ_W) = 1 - (πα / √2 G_F M_Z^2)\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant.\n\nThe experimentally determined values are:\n\n- Z boson mass (M_Z) = 91.1876 GeV/c^2\n- Fermi constant (G_F) = 1.1663787 x 10^-5 GeV^-2\n- Fine-structure constant (α) ≈ 1/137 ≈ 7.29735257 x 10^-3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nsin^2(θ_W) = 1 - (π(7.29735257 x 10^-3) / √2 (1.1663787 x 10^-5) (91.1876)^2)\n\nsin^2(θ_W) ≈ 0.2312\n\nNow, we can find the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle) θ_W:\n\nθ_W = arcsin(√0.2312)\n\nθ_W ≈ 28.74°\n\nSo, the value of the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle) in the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg (GSW) theory of electroweak interactions is approximately 28.74°."
