    "message_2": "To determine the event horizon radius and electric charge of a Reissner-Nordström black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass into kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 5 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe event horizon radius, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (r_s), can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 1.474 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, to find the electric charge (Q) of the Reissner-Nordström black hole, we need to use the formula for the outer event horizon radius (r_+):\n\nr_+ = (G * M + sqrt((G * M)^2 - (G * Q^2) / (4 * pi * epsilon_0))) / c^2\n\nwhere epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2 N^-1 m^-2).\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find the exact value of Q, we can only provide a constraint on its maximum value. The black hole becomes extremal when the inner and outer event horizons coincide, which means:\n\n(G * M)^2 = (G * Q^2) / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)\n\nSolving for Q, we get:\n\nQ = sqrt((4 * pi * epsilon_0) * (G * M)^2)\nQ ≈ 1.041 x 10^20 C\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of the Reissner-Nordström black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 1.474 x 10^4 meters, and its electric charge is constrained to be less than or equal to 1.041 x 10^20 Coulombs."
