    "message_1": "A physics student is given a polarizing filter whose transmission axis is at a 30-degree angle to the vertical. The student then places a second polarizing filter in front of the first one with its transmission axis vertical. What percentage of the initial intensity of a polarized light beam passing through the first filter is transmitted through both filters? Use Malus' Law to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizing filters is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters is 30 degrees. To calculate the transmitted intensity, we can plug this value into Malus' Law:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 30 degrees. In radians, 30 degrees is equal to π/6:\n\ncos(30°) = cos(π/6) ≈ 0.866\n\nNow, we can square this value:\n\ncos²(30°) ≈ 0.866² ≈ 0.750\n\nFinally, we can plug this value back into Malus' Law:\n\nI = I₀ * 0.750\n\nThis means that 75% of the initial intensity of the polarized light beam is transmitted through both filters."
