    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 2000 lines per centimeter. A beam of monochromatic light (λ= 600 nm) passes through this grating and produces a diffracted pattern on a screen. How many bright fringes will be observed in the first order spectrum if the distance between the grating and the screen is 1 meter?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes in a diffraction grating:\n\nmλ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere m is the order of the spectrum (m = 1 for the first order), λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines in the grating, and θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines in the grating (d). Since there are 2000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 / (2000 lines/cm) = 1/2000 cm = 1/20000 m\n\nNow, we can find the maximum angle (θ_max) for which the first-order bright fringe can be observed. This occurs when sin(θ) = 1:\n\n1 * λ = d * sin(θ_max)\nsin(θ_max) = λ / d\nθ_max = arcsin(λ / d)\n\nPlugging in the values for λ and d:\n\nθ_max = arcsin((600 * 10^-9 m) / (1/20000 m))\nθ_max ≈ arcsin(0.012) ≈ 0.012 radians\n\nNow, we can find the width of the first-order spectrum on the screen. Since the distance between the grating and the screen is 1 meter, we can use the small angle approximation:\n\nWidth = 2 * L * tan(θ_max) ≈ 2 * L * θ_max\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nWidth ≈ 2 * 1 m * 0.012 ≈ 0.024 m\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between adjacent bright fringes in the first-order spectrum. This can be found using the formula:\n\nΔy = L * λ / d\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔy ≈ 1 m * (600 * 10^-9 m) / (1/20000 m) ≈ 0.000012 m\n\nFinally, we can find the number of bright fringes in the first-order spectrum by dividing the width of the spectrum by the distance between adjacent bright fringes:\n\nNumber of bright fringes = Width / Δy\n\nNumber of bright fringes ≈ 0.024 m / 0.000012 m ≈ 2000\n\nSo, there will be approximately 2000 bright fringes observed in the first-order spectrum."
