    "message_1": "What is the energy of a neutron that has been scattered by a nucleus with a mass number of 56 and an atomic number of 26, if the incident neutron had an energy of 3.2 MeV and was scattered at an angle of 45 degrees? Use the formula E_f = E_i/(1+(m/m_n)+2(m/m_n)cos(theta)), where E_f is the final energy of the scattered neutron, E_i is the initial energy of the incident neutron, m is the mass number of the nucleus, m_n is the mass of the neutron, and theta is the scattering angle.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the given formula:\n\nE_f = E_i / (1 + (m/m_n) + 2(m/m_n)cos(theta))\n\nwhere:\nE_i = 3.2 MeV (initial energy of the incident neutron)\nm = 56 (mass number of the nucleus)\nm_n = 1 (mass of the neutron, approximately equal to 1 for simplicity)\ntheta = 45 degrees (scattering angle)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\ntheta = 45 * (pi/180) = 0.7854 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nE_f = 3.2 / (1 + (56/1) + 2(56/1)cos(0.7854))\n\nE_f = 3.2 / (1 + 56 + 2(56)(0.7071))\n\nE_f = 3.2 / (1 + 56 + 79.1984)\n\nE_f = 3.2 / 136.1984\n\nE_f â‰ˆ 0.0235 MeV\n\nSo, the energy of the scattered neutron is approximately 0.0235 MeV."
