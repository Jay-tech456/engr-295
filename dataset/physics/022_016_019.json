    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They are considered as a potential candidate for dark matter due to their weakly interacting nature. The mass range and mixing angle for sterile neutrinos depend on the specific theoretical model and observational constraints.\n\nIn general, the mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is predicted to be in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) scale. This is because lighter sterile neutrinos (eV or meV scale) would behave as hot dark matter, which is inconsistent with the observed large-scale structure of the universe. Heavier sterile neutrinos (GeV scale or higher) would be difficult to produce in sufficient quantities to account for dark matter.\n\nThe mixing angle between sterile and active neutrinos, often denoted as Î¸, determines the strength of their interaction. Smaller mixing angles imply weaker interactions between sterile and active neutrinos. Current observational constraints, such as X-ray observations and structure formation data, suggest that the mixing angle should be quite small, typically less than 10^(-8) to 10^(-10).\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that these values are model-dependent and subject to change as new data and theoretical developments emerge. The search for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is an ongoing area of research in both theoretical and experimental physics."
