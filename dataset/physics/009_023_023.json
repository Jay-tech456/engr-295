    "message_1": "What is the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers whose axes are inclined at an angle of 35° with respect to each other, if the intensity of the incident light is 500 W/m² and the transmission axis of the first polarizer makes an angle of 60° with the vertical? Use Malus' Law to solve.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the incident intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, the incident intensity (I₀) is 500 W/m², and the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers (θ) is 35°. We can now use Malus' Law to find the transmitted intensity:\n\nI = 500 * cos²(35°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 35°:\n\ncos(35°) ≈ 0.8192\n\nNow, we can square this value and multiply it by the incident intensity:\n\nI = 500 * (0.8192)²\nI ≈ 500 * 0.6711\nI ≈ 335.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of light transmitted through the two polarizers is approximately 335.5 W/m²."
