    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the cross-section for photon-photon scattering can be calculated using the Feynman diagrams and the corresponding matrix elements. The main contribution to photon-photon scattering comes from the light-by-light scattering process, where two photons interact indirectly through a loop of charged particles, such as electrons and positrons.\n\nTo calculate the cross-section for unpolarized photons, we need to average over the initial photon polarizations and sum over the final photon polarizations. The differential cross-section for photon-photon scattering can be expressed as:\n\ndσ/dt = (α^2 / 8πs) |M|^2\n\nHere, α is the fine-structure constant, s is the Mandelstam variable representing the square of the center-of-mass energy, t is another Mandelstam variable related to the momentum transfer, and |M|^2 is the squared matrix element, which depends on the specific interaction process.\n\nFor the light-by-light scattering process, the squared matrix element can be calculated using the box and crossed-box Feynman diagrams. The result is:\n\n|M|^2 = (8π^2α^4 / m_e^4) [(2u^2 + 2t^2) / (u^2t^2) + (2s^2 + 2t^2) / (s^2t^2) + (2s^2 + 2u^2) / (s^2u^2)]\n\nHere, m_e is the electron mass, and u is the third Mandelstam variable, which is related to s and t by the relation s + t + u = 0.\n\nTo obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the allowed range of t. However, the integration is challenging due to the singularities in the matrix element. In practice, the cross-section is often calculated numerically for specific values of the center-of-mass energy.\n\nIt's important to note that the photon-photon scattering cross-section is very small, as it's suppressed by the factor of α^4. This makes the process extremely rare and challenging to observe experimentally."
