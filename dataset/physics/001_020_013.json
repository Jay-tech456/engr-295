    "message_2": "The fine structure constant, denoted by α (alpha), is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. Its value is approximately 1/137 or 0.0072973525693.\n\nIn quantum electrodynamics (QED), the fine structure constant is related to the coupling constant, which determines the strength of the interaction between charged particles and the electromagnetic field. The coupling constant in QED is usually denoted by e (the elementary charge) and is related to the fine structure constant through the following equation:\n\nα = e^2 / (4πε₀ħc)\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nRenormalization is a technique used in quantum field theories, such as QED, to deal with the divergences that arise in calculations. These divergences are often due to the presence of infinite quantities, such as the self-energy of an electron or the vacuum energy. Renormalization helps to make sense of these infinities by absorbing them into the parameters of the theory, such as the mass and charge of the particles.\n\nThe basic idea behind renormalization is to separate the contributions to physical quantities into two parts: a finite part that depends on the experimentally measurable parameters, and an infinite part that can be absorbed into the redefinition of these parameters. By doing this, the divergences are effectively removed from the calculations, and the resulting renormalized quantities can be used to make meaningful predictions about physical processes.\n\nIn summary, the fine structure constant is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, and it is related to the coupling constant in QED. Renormalization is a technique used to deal with the divergences that arise in QED calculations by absorbing them into the parameters of the theory, allowing for meaningful predictions to be made about physical processes."
