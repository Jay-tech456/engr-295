    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at 600 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K. If the engine absorbs 2000 J of heat energy from the hot reservoir and produces 1250 J of work, what is the Carnot efficiency of the engine?",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency that a heat engine can achieve when operating between two reservoirs at different temperatures. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 600 K.\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 600 K) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nThe Carnot efficiency of the engine is 50%."
