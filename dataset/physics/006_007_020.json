    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment, conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, provides experimental evidence for the quantization of atomic energy levels and the absorption/emission of photons. The experiment involves the inelastic collision of electrons with mercury atoms in a low-pressure gas discharge tube.\n\nHere's how the experiment demonstrates the quantization of atomic energy levels and the absorption/emission of photons:\n\n1. Setup: The experimental setup consists of a gas discharge tube containing mercury vapor at low pressure. The tube has three electrodes: a heated cathode that emits electrons, a grid, and an anode. A variable voltage is applied between the cathode and the grid, accelerating the electrons towards the grid. A small retarding voltage is applied between the grid and the anode, which allows only the electrons with sufficient energy to pass through and reach the anode. The current at the anode is measured.\n\n2. Electron acceleration and collisions: As the voltage between the cathode and the grid is increased, the electrons gain more kinetic energy. When these accelerated electrons collide with mercury atoms, they can transfer energy to the atoms. If the energy transferred is sufficient, the electrons in the mercury atoms can be excited to higher energy levels.\n\n3. Quantization of energy levels: The Franck-Hertz experiment shows that the anode current exhibits a series of minima at specific voltage intervals. This indicates that the energy transfer between the electrons and the mercury atoms occurs only at discrete energy values, which correspond to the differences between the quantized energy levels of the mercury atoms. This observation supports the idea of quantization of atomic energy levels, as proposed by Niels Bohr in his atomic model.\n\n4. Absorption of energy: When an electron collides with a mercury atom and transfers the exact amount of energy required for an electron in the mercury atom to jump to a higher energy level, the kinetic energy of the colliding electron is significantly reduced. As a result, the electron may not have enough energy to overcome the retarding voltage between the grid and the anode, leading to a decrease in the anode current. This process demonstrates the absorption of energy by the mercury atoms in discrete amounts (quanta).\n\n5. Emission of photons: After the mercury atoms absorb energy and their electrons are excited to higher energy levels, they eventually return to their original lower energy levels by emitting photons. The energy of these emitted photons corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels involved in the transition. This emission of photons in discrete energy packets provides further evidence for the quantization of atomic energy levels.\n\nIn summary, the Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates the quantization of atomic energy levels and the absorption/emission of photons by showing that energy transfer between electrons and mercury atoms occurs only at specific, discrete energy values. This observation supports the idea that atomic energy levels are quantized and that photons are absorbed and emitted in quantized amounts during transitions between these levels."
