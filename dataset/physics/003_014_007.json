    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of dimensions 5 cm by 10 cm carries a current of 2 amps. Find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, assuming that the current flows clockwise when viewed from above.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider the four segments:\n\n1. Top segment: length = 10 cm, distance from the center = 2.5 cm\n2. Bottom segment: length = 10 cm, distance from the center = 2.5 cm\n3. Left segment: length = 5 cm, distance from the center = 5 cm\n4. Right segment: length = 5 cm, distance from the center = 5 cm\n\nFor each segment, the magnetic field at the center can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * L) / (4 * π * d)\n\nwhere L is the length of the segment and d is the distance from the center.\n\n1. Top segment:\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m) / (4 * π * 0.025 m) = 8 × 10^(-7) T\n\n2. Bottom segment:\nB₂ = -B₁ (since the magnetic field due to the bottom segment is in the opposite direction of the top segment) = -8 × 10^(-7) T\n\n3. Left segment:\nB₃ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.05 m) / (4 * π * 0.05 m) = 2 × 10^(-7) T\n\n4. Right segment:\nB₄ = -B₃ (since the magnetic field due to the right segment is in the opposite direction of the left segment) = -2 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄ = 8 × 10^(-7) T - 8 × 10^(-7) T + 2 × 10^(-7) T - 2 × 10^(-7) T = 0 T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 0 T."
