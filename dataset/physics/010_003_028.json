    "message_2": "To find the terminal velocity of the steel ball falling through a liquid, we can use Stoke's Law for the motion of a sphere through a viscous medium. Stoke's Law states that the drag force acting on the sphere is given by:\n\nF_d = 6πηrv\n\nwhere F_d is the drag force, η is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, r is the radius of the sphere, and v is the terminal velocity.\n\nAt terminal velocity, the drag force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the sphere. The gravitational force is given by:\n\nF_g = mg\n\nwhere m is the mass of the sphere and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nThe mass of the steel ball can be calculated using its volume and density. The density of steel is approximately 7850 kg/m³. The volume V of the sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so r = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m. Now, we can calculate the volume:\n\nV = (4/3)π(0.025)³ ≈ 6.54 × 10⁻⁵ m³\n\nThe mass of the sphere is the product of its volume and density:\n\nm = ρV = 7850 kg/m³ × 6.54 × 10⁻⁵ m³ ≈ 0.513 kg\n\nNow, we can equate the drag force and gravitational force:\n\n6πηrv = mg\n\nWe need to solve for v, the terminal velocity:\n\nv = mg / (6πηr)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv = (0.513 kg × 9.81 m/s²) / (6π × 1.5 Pa·s × 0.025 m) ≈ 1.33 m/s\n\nThe terminal velocity of the steel ball falling through the liquid with a viscosity of 1.5 Pa·s is approximately 1.33 m/s."
