    "message_2": "To find the energy of a tau lepton with a given momentum, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere E is the energy, p is the momentum, c is the speed of light, and m is the mass of the tau lepton.\n\nThe mass of a tau lepton is approximately 1.7768 GeV/c². The momentum given is 3 GeV/c. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nE² = (3 GeV/c * c)² + (1.7768 GeV/c² * c²)²\nE² = (3 GeV)² + (1.7768 GeV)²\nE² = 9 GeV² + 3.1575 GeV²\nE² ≈ 12.1575 GeV²\n\nNow, taking the square root of both sides to find the energy:\n\nE ≈ √12.1575 GeV²\nE ≈ 3.486 GeV\n\nSo, the energy of a tau lepton with a momentum of 3 GeV/c is approximately 3.486 GeV."
