    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the supernova, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the supernova to the Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the supernova from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the supernova in kilograms is:\n\nM = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from the supernova to the Earth from megaparsecs to meters. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10^16 meters, and one megaparsec is 10^6 parsecs. Therefore, the distance in meters is:\n\nR = 10 * 10^6 * 3.086 x 10^16 m = 3.086 x 10^22 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.086 x 10^22 m)\n\nE ≈ (6.674 x 10^-11 * (1.582 x 10^63) * 3 x 10^8) / (3.086 x 10^22)\n\nE ≈ (3.157 x 10^52) / (3.086 x 10^22)\n\nE ≈ 1.023 x 10^30 Joules\n\nSo, the estimated energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a mass of 20 solar masses, located 10 megaparsecs away from Earth, is approximately 1.023 x 10^30 Joules."
