    "message_2": "To calculate the adiabatic work done in this process, we can use the following equation for adiabatic work:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats, Cp/Cv).\n\nFor an ideal gas, the adiabatic index γ can be found using the degrees of freedom (f) of the gas:\n\nγ = 1 + 2/f\n\nSince we don't know the specific gas, we can't determine the exact value of γ. However, for most diatomic gases (like O2, N2, etc.), the degrees of freedom f = 5, and γ = 1.4. For monatomic gases (like He, Ne, etc.), f = 3, and γ = 1.67. We'll proceed with the calculation using γ = 1.4, but keep in mind that the result will depend on the specific gas.\n\nSince the process is adiabatic and the temperature is constant, we can use the adiabatic relation:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nWe know P1, P2, and V1, and we want to find V2:\n\n3 atm * (2 L)^1.4 = 1 atm * V2^1.4\n\nSolving for V2:\n\nV2^1.4 = (3 atm * 2 L) / 1 atm\nV2^1.4 = 6 L\nV2 = (6 L)^(1/1.4)\nV2 ≈ 3.42 L\n\nNow we can calculate the adiabatic work done:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\nW = (3 atm * 2 L - 1 atm * 3.42 L) / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ (6 atm L - 3.42 atm L) / 0.4\nW ≈ 6.45 atm L\n\nThe adiabatic work done in this process is approximately 6.45 atm L. Keep in mind that this result is for a diatomic gas with γ = 1.4. The work done will be different for other gases with different adiabatic indices."
