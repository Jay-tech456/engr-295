    "message_2": "The interaction between a supernova explosion and its surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) plays a crucial role in shaping the observed properties of the supernova remnant (SNR). This interaction can be divided into several stages, and each stage contributes to the observed properties of the SNR in different ways.\n\n1. Ejecta-dominated stage: In the initial phase of the supernova explosion, the ejected material from the supernova expands rapidly into the surrounding ISM. At this stage, the SNR is dominated by the properties of the ejected material, such as its mass, energy, and composition. The interaction with the ISM is minimal, and the observed properties of the SNR are mainly determined by the properties of the supernova ejecta.\n\n2. Sedov-Taylor phase: As the ejecta expands, it sweeps up the surrounding ISM and forms a strong shock wave. This shock wave heats the ISM and creates a hot, high-pressure region behind it. The SNR now enters the Sedov-Taylor phase, where the dynamics of the remnant are determined by the balance between the energy of the explosion and the mass of the swept-up ISM. The observed properties of the SNR, such as its size, brightness, and temperature, are now influenced by both the properties of the supernova ejecta and the properties of the surrounding ISM.\n\n3. Radiative phase: As the SNR continues to expand, the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave decrease, and the SNR starts to cool radiatively. The cooling causes the shock wave to slow down and the SNR to become more compressed. The observed properties of the SNR, such as its brightness and temperature, are now strongly influenced by the cooling processes and the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the ISM.\n\n4. Transition to the late-stage SNR: Eventually, the SNR becomes so large and diffuse that the shock wave dissipates, and the SNR merges with the surrounding ISM. At this stage, the observed properties of the SNR are mainly determined by the properties of the ISM, such as its density, temperature, and magnetic field.\n\nThroughout these stages, the interaction between the supernova explosion and the surrounding ISM affects the observed properties of the SNR in several ways:\n\n- The density and composition of the ISM determine the amount of material that is swept up by the shock wave, which in turn affects the brightness, temperature, and size of the SNR.\n\n- The magnetic field in the ISM influences the acceleration of charged particles at the shock front, which can produce synchrotron radiation that is observed at radio wavelengths.\n\n- The interaction between the supernova ejecta and the ISM can lead to the formation of complex structures within the SNR, such as filaments, knots, and shells, which can be observed at various wavelengths, including optical, X-ray, and radio.\n\n- The interaction can also result in the mixing of supernova ejecta with the ISM, which can affect the observed chemical composition of the SNR and provide valuable information about the nucleosynthesis processes that occurred during the supernova explosion.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between a supernova explosion and its surrounding interstellar medium plays a crucial role in shaping the observed properties of the supernova remnant. This interaction influences the size, brightness, temperature, structure, and chemical composition of the SNR, providing valuable information about the supernova explosion and the properties of the interstellar medium."
