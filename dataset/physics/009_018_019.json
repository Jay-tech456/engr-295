    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the two slits in a double-slit interference experiment, the student can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere:\nθ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th bright fringe,\nm is the order of the bright fringe (m = 1, 2, 3, ...),\nλ is the wavelength of the light used in the experiment,\nd is the distance between the two slits.\n\nThe student also needs to know the distance between the screen and the slits (L) and the distance between each bright fringe (y_m). Using the small-angle approximation, we can write:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y_m / L\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\ny_m / L ≈ (m * λ) / d\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd ≈ (m * λ * L) / y_m\n\nThe student needs to know the wavelength of the light used in the experiment (λ) and the order of the bright fringe (m) to calculate the distance between the two slits (d)."
