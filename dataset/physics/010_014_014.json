    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying at Mach 2.5 at an altitude of 10 km. Suddenly, it encounters a shock wave. Determine the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave if the temperature and pressure ahead of the shock wave are 220°C and 1 atm respectively. Assume the gas to be an ideal diatomic gas.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave, we can use the normal shock relations for an ideal diatomic gas. For a diatomic gas, the specific heat ratio (γ) is 1.4.\n\nThe Mach number ahead of the shock wave (M1) is given as 2.5.\n\nUsing the normal shock relations, we can find the Mach number behind the shock wave (M2) using the following formula:\n\nM2² = ( (2 * γ * M1² - (γ - 1) * M1² ) / ( (γ + 1) * M1² ) )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM2² = ( (2 * 1.4 * 2.5² - (1.4 - 1) * 2.5² ) / ( (1.4 + 1) * 2.5² ) )\nM2² ≈ 0.5136\nM2 ≈ 0.7167\n\nNow, we can find the pressure ratio (P2/P1) and temperature ratio (T2/T1) using the following formulas:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + ( (2 * γ) / (γ + 1) ) * (M1² - 1)\nT2/T1 = P2/P1 * ( (2 + (γ - 1) * M1²) / ( (γ + 1) * M1² ) )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + ( (2 * 1.4) / (1.4 + 1) ) * (2.5² - 1)\nP2/P1 ≈ 4.50\n\nT2/T1 = 4.50 * ( (2 + (1.4 - 1) * 2.5²) / ( (1.4 + 1) * 2.5² ) )\nT2/T1 ≈ 1.687\n\nNow, we can find the pressure (P2) and temperature (T2) behind the shock wave:\n\nP1 = 1 atm = 101325 Pa\nT1 = 220°C = 493.15 K\n\nP2 = P2/P1 * P1\nP2 ≈ 4.50 * 101325 Pa\nP2 ≈ 456462.5 Pa\n\nT2 = T2/T1 * T1\nT2 ≈ 1.687 * 493.15 K\nT2 ≈ 832.5 K\n\nConverting the temperature back to Celsius:\n\nT2 ≈ 832.5 K - 273.15\nT2 ≈ 559.35°C\n\nSo, the temperature and pressure behind the shock wave are approximately 559.35°C and 456462.5 Pa (4.50 atm), respectively."
