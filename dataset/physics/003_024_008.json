    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2.5 A\nN = 200 turns\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A * 200 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2.5 * 200 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1.57 × 10^(-6) * 500 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1.96 × 10^(-3)) / (2 * 0.0442)\n\nB ≈ 0.0222 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil is approximately 0.0222 T (Tesla)."
