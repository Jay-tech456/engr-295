    "message_2": "To determine the minimum mass a primordial black hole (PBH) would need to have in order to contribute significantly to the observed dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the constraints on the abundance of PBHs and their mass range.\n\nPrimordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could potentially contribute to the dark matter content of the universe. However, there are several observational constraints on the abundance and mass of PBHs, such as the effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation, gravitational lensing, and the evaporation of PBHs through Hawking radiation.\n\nThe mass range of PBHs that could contribute to dark matter is still uncertain and spans several orders of magnitude. However, recent studies have suggested that PBHs with masses around 10^(-10) to 10^(-8) solar masses (M☉) could potentially account for a significant fraction of the dark matter content in the universe. This mass range is not ruled out by current observational constraints.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the mass of a typical star, like our Sun, is 1 solar mass (M☉). The mass of a PBH that could contribute to dark matter is much smaller than the mass of a typical star. For example, a PBH with a mass of 10^(-10) M☉ would be 10 billion times less massive than the Sun.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact mass range and contribution of PBHs to dark matter are still subjects of ongoing research and debate among physicists."
