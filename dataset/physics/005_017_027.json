    "message_1": "A particle with rest mass $m$ is initially at rest at the origin of a coordinate system. Suddenly, it is imparted with a velocity $v$ in the $x$-direction. What is the trajectory of the particle as observed by an observer at rest in the original coordinate system? Use the equations of relativistic motion to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Since the particle is moving in the x-direction with velocity v, we can assume that its trajectory will be a straight line along the x-axis. To find the trajectory of the particle as observed by an observer at rest in the original coordinate system, we need to consider the relativistic effects due to the particle's motion.\n\nIn the context of special relativity, the trajectory of the particle can be described by its space-time coordinates (ct, x), where c is the speed of light and t is the time coordinate. The Lorentz transformation equations relate the space-time coordinates of an event in one inertial frame (the particle's frame) to the coordinates in another inertial frame (the observer's frame). The Lorentz transformation equations are given by:\n\nct' = γ(ct - βx)\nx' = γ(x - βct)\n\nwhere\n- (ct', x') are the space-time coordinates in the particle's frame\n- (ct, x) are the space-time coordinates in the observer's frame\n- β = v/c is the dimensionless velocity of the particle\n- γ = 1/√(1 - β^2) is the Lorentz factor\n\nSince the particle is initially at rest at the origin, we have x' = 0. We can use the second Lorentz transformation equation to find the trajectory of the particle in the observer's frame:\n\nx = γ(x' + βct) = γ(0 + βct) = γβct\n\nNow, we can express the trajectory as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = γβct\n\nThe trajectory of the particle as observed by an observer at rest in the original coordinate system is a straight line along the x-axis with a relativistic correction factor γβ. The particle's motion will appear to be slower than its non-relativistic motion (v*t) due to time dilation and length contraction effects."
