    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference and collide with mercury atoms. The minimum accelerating potential difference required to excite a mercury atom from its ground state to the first excited state corresponds to the energy difference between these two states.\n\nThe energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of mercury is 4.9 eV (electron volts). To calculate the minimum accelerating potential difference, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔE = e * ΔV\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two states, e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^(-19) C), and ΔV is the potential difference.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for ΔV:\n\nΔV = ΔE / e\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nΔV = (4.9 eV) / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C/eV)\n\nΔV ≈ 3.06 × 10^(-19) J / (1.6 × 10^(-19) C)\n\nΔV ≈ 4.9 V\n\nSo, the minimum accelerating potential difference required in the Franck-Hertz experiment to excite mercury atoms from their ground state to the first excited state is approximately 4.9 volts.\n\nThe physical significance of this result is that it experimentally confirms the quantization of energy levels in atoms. When the accelerating potential difference is less than 4.9 volts, the electrons do not have enough energy to excite the mercury atoms, and no energy is transferred. However, when the potential difference reaches 4.9 volts, the electrons have enough energy to excite the mercury atoms, and energy is transferred in discrete amounts (quanta). This result supports the quantum theory of atomic energy levels and provides experimental evidence for the quantization of energy in atoms."
