    "message_2": "In Young's double-slit experiment, the interference pattern on the screen is due to the superposition of waves from the two slits. The condition for constructive interference (bright fringes) is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the slits, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum (m = 0, 1, 2, ...), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance between the slits and the screen (L = 2 meters), the angle for the second-order maximum (θ = 30 degrees), and we need to find the distance between the slits (d).\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength of the light (λ). To do this, we can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum on the screen. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nNow, we can use the condition for constructive interference:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = d * sin(θ) / m\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem (L = 2 meters, θ = 30 degrees, m = 2), we get:\n\ny = 2 * tan(30) = 2 * (1 / √3) = 2√3 / 3 meters\n\nNow, we can use the condition for constructive interference:\n\nd * sin(30) = 2 * λ\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = 2 * λ / sin(30)\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier (y = 2√3 / 3 meters, λ = y / 2), we get:\n\nd = 2 * (2√3 / 3) / (1 / 2) = 4√3 / 3 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in Young's double-slit experiment is approximately 4√3 / 3 meters."
