    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nA certain radioactive isotope emits alpha particles with an energy of 5 MeV. A detector with a solid angle of 0.5 sr is placed at a distance of 10 cm from the source. If the detector efficiency is 10%, how many alpha particles will be detected per second?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of alpha particles emitted by the radioactive isotope per second and then determine how many of those particles will be detected by the detector.\n\nFirst, let's find the activity (A) of the radioactive isotope. The activity is the number of decays per second, and it is given by:\n\nA = N * λ\n\nwhere N is the number of radioactive nuclei and λ is the decay constant. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate the activity directly. However, we can still find the number of alpha particles detected per second using the given information.\n\nThe fraction of emitted alpha particles that will be detected by the detector can be calculated using the solid angle (Ω) of the detector and the total solid angle of a sphere (4π sr):\n\nFraction = Ω / (4π) = 0.5 sr / (4π sr) ≈ 0.0398\n\nNow, let's assume that the radioactive isotope emits R alpha particles per second. The number of alpha particles that will reach the detector per second is:\n\nParticles_reaching_detector = R * Fraction ≈ 0.0398 * R\n\nFinally, we need to take into account the detector efficiency (10% or 0.1). The number of alpha particles detected per second is:\n\nParticles_detected = Particles_reaching_detector * Efficiency ≈ 0.0398 * R * 0.1\n\nParticles_detected ≈ 0.00398 * R\n\nSo, the number of alpha particles detected per second is approximately 0.00398 times the number of alpha particles emitted per second (R). Without more information about the radioactive isotope, we cannot determine the exact number of alpha particles detected per second."
