Then the filter is rotated by an angle of 45 degrees, and the intensity of transmitted light is measured again. Calculate the percentage change in intensity of light after rotating the filter.",
    "message_2": "When light passes through a polarized filter, the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the angle between the polarization axis of the filter and the plane of polarization of the light. The relationship between the initial intensity (I0) and the transmitted intensity (I) can be described by Malus's Law:\n\nI = I0 * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere theta is the angle between the polarization axis of the filter and the plane of polarization of the light.\n\nIn this problem, the filter is rotated by an angle of 45 degrees. Therefore, theta = 45 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\ntheta = 45 * (pi/180) = pi/4 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmitted intensity after rotating the filter:\n\nI = I0 * cos^2(pi/4)\n\nI = I0 * (1/sqrt(2))^2\n\nI = I0 * 1/2\n\nThe transmitted intensity after rotating the filter is half of the initial intensity. To find the percentage change in intensity, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage change = ((I - I0) / I0) * 100\n\nPercentage change = ((I0 * 1/2 - I0) / I0) * 100\n\nPercentage change = ((1/2 - 1) * 100)%\n\nPercentage change = (-1/2) * 100%\n\nPercentage change = -50%\n\nThe intensity of the transmitted light decreases by 50% after rotating the polarized filter by 45 degrees."
