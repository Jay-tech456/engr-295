    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is related to the focal length by:\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven that the radius of curvature R is 15 cm, the focal length f is:\n\nf = 15 cm / 2 = 7.5 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the image distance di. The object distance do is 30 cm:\n\n1/7.5 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/7.5 - 1/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(4 - 1) / 30 = 1/di\n3 / 30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30 / 3\ndi = 10 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror's vertex.\n\nNow, let's discuss the effect of chromatic and spherical aberration on the image quality.\n\n1. Chromatic aberration: This occurs due to the dispersion of light, where different wavelengths of light are refracted by different amounts. However, chromatic aberration is not significant in mirrors, as it is more relevant to lenses. Mirrors reflect all wavelengths of light equally, so chromatic aberration does not affect the image quality in this case.\n\n2. Spherical aberration: This occurs when light rays parallel to the optical axis are reflected by a spherical mirror and do not converge at a single point. Spherical aberration can cause the image to be blurred or distorted. In this case, since the object is placed at a distance of 30 cm from the mirror's vertex, which is twice the focal length, the spherical aberration effect will be present but relatively small. To minimize spherical aberration, a parabolic mirror can be used instead of a spherical mirror.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror's vertex, and the image quality is mainly affected by spherical aberration, while chromatic aberration does not play a significant role in this case."
