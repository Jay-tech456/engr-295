    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Since the black hole has a mass of 3 times that of the sun, its mass is:\n\nM = 3 x (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 x (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) x (5.967 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 8.847 x 10^3 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius, which is also the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole, is approximately 8,847 meters or 8.847 kilometers."
