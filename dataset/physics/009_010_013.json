    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 15 cm and the object distance u = 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(2 + 1)/30 = 1/v\n\nNow, we have:\n\n3/30 = 1/v\n\nTo find v, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 30/3\n\nv = 10 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed 10 cm away from the mirror.\n\nNext, we need to find the magnification (m) of the image. The magnification can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nm = -10/30\n\nm = -1/3\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1/3, which means the image is inverted (due to the negative sign) and 1/3 the size of the object."
