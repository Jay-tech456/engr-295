    "message_2": "To calculate the running coupling constant of the strong force in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at a certain energy scale, we need the initial value of the coupling constant (α_s(Q₀)) at a reference energy scale (Q₀), the beta function of QCD (β(α_s)), and the energy scale of interest (Q).\n\nThe running coupling constant α_s(Q) can be determined using the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE):\n\ndα_s(Q) / d(ln(Q)) = β(α_s(Q))\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to know the explicit form of the beta function. In QCD, the beta function can be expressed as a perturbative series:\n\nβ(α_s) = -b₀ * (α_s / (2π))^2 - b₁ * (α_s / (2π))^3 - ...\n\nwhere b₀ and b₁ are the first two coefficients of the beta function, which depend on the number of active quark flavors (N_f) and the number of colors (N_c, which is 3 for QCD). The coefficients are given by:\n\nb₀ = (11 * N_c - 2 * N_f) / 3\nb₁ = (34 * N_c^2 - 10 * N_c * N_f + N_f * (N_f - 1)) / 6\n\nTo obtain an approximate solution for α_s(Q), we can use the one-loop approximation, which only considers the first term in the beta function:\n\ndα_s(Q) / d(ln(Q)) = -b₀ * (α_s(Q) / (2π))^2\n\nIntegrating this equation, we get:\n\n1 / α_s(Q) - 1 / α_s(Q₀) = b₀ * ln(Q / Q₀) / (2π)\n\nNow, we can solve for α_s(Q):\n\nα_s(Q) = 1 / (1 / α_s(Q₀) + b₀ * ln(Q / Q₀) / (2π))\n\nGiven the initial value of the coupling constant α_s(Q₀), the number of active quark flavors N_f, and the energy scales Q₀ and Q, we can calculate the running coupling constant α_s(Q) using this formula."
