    "message_2": "The polarization state of gravitational waves detected by LIGO can be described as a combination of two linearly polarized states, known as \"plus\" (+) and \"cross\" (x) polarizations. These two polarizations are named after the shapes they create when they pass through a ring of test particles in space. The plus polarization causes particles to oscillate in a \"+\" shape, while the cross polarization causes particles to oscillate in an \"x\" shape.\n\nThe polarization state of the detected gravitational waves helps us understand the nature of the source of the waves because it provides information about the orientation and dynamics of the system that produced the waves. For example, the relative amplitudes and phases of the plus and cross polarizations can reveal the inclination angle of the binary system (the angle between the plane of the orbit and the line of sight from Earth). This information, combined with the frequency and amplitude of the waves, allows scientists to infer the masses and spins of the objects involved, as well as the distance to the source.\n\nIn the case of the first gravitational wave detection by LIGO in 2015 (GW150914), the waves were produced by the merger of two black holes. The polarization state of the detected waves, along with other properties of the signal, allowed scientists to determine that the black holes had masses of about 29 and 36 solar masses, and that they merged to form a single black hole of about 62 solar masses. The remaining 3 solar masses were converted into gravitational wave energy. This observation confirmed the existence of binary black hole systems and provided a new way to study the universe through gravitational wave astronomy."
