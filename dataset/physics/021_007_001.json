    "message_2": "A black hole, like any massive object, exerts a gravitational force on nearby celestial bodies. This force can have a significant effect on the orbits of these objects, depending on the mass of the black hole, the mass of the celestial body, and the distance between them.\n\nThe gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF = G * (M1 * M2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nWhen a celestial body orbits a black hole, the gravitational force from the black hole causes the body to follow an elliptical or hyperbolic trajectory, depending on the initial conditions of the orbit. The shape and size of the orbit are determined by the balance between the gravitational force and the body's initial velocity.\n\nThe mass of the celestial body (M2) plays a role in determining the strength of the gravitational force between it and the black hole (M1). A more massive celestial body will experience a stronger gravitational force, which can cause it to follow a more tightly bound orbit around the black hole.\n\nThe distance between the celestial body and the black hole (r) also has a significant impact on the orbit. As the distance between the two objects increases, the gravitational force between them decreases, leading to a weaker influence of the black hole on the celestial body's orbit. Conversely, as the distance decreases, the gravitational force increases, causing the celestial body to follow a more tightly bound orbit or even be swallowed by the black hole if it gets too close.\n\nIn the case of a black hole with a mass similar to that of a star, the effect on nearby celestial bodies would be similar to the effect of a star on its planets. However, if the black hole has a much larger mass, such as a supermassive black hole found at the center of galaxies, its gravitational influence can extend over much greater distances and affect the orbits of stars and other celestial bodies throughout the galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the effect of a black hole on the orbit of nearby celestial bodies depends on the masses of the black hole and the celestial body, as well as the distance between them. A more massive black hole and a closer distance will result in a stronger gravitational force, causing the celestial body to follow a more tightly bound orbit or even be swallowed by the black hole if it gets too close."
