    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizing filter, the intensity of the transmitted light is reduced by half. This is because the filter only allows light waves oscillating in one direction to pass through. So, the initial intensity of the light after passing through the first polarizer is:\n\nI₀ = 10.0 W/m² * 0.5 = 5.0 W/m²\n\nNow, when this polarized light passes through a second polarizing filter, the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters. The Malus' law states that the intensity of the transmitted light is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I₀ is the intensity of the polarized light before passing through the second filter, θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters, and I is the intensity of the transmitted light.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the filter and the polarizer is 45 degrees:\n\nθ = 45° = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI = 5.0 W/m² * cos²(π/4) = 5.0 W/m² * (1/2) = 2.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light that passes through the polarizing filter is 2.5 W/m²."
