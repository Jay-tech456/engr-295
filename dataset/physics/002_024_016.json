    "message_2": "To find the vapor pressure of liquid water at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.67 kJ/mol, which is equal to 40,670 J/mol. We are also given the temperature (T2) as 25°C, which is equal to 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K. \n\nTo use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we need a reference point (P1, T1) with known vapor pressure. A common reference point is the normal boiling point of water, where the vapor pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.325 kPa). The normal boiling point of water is 100°C or 373.15 K.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -40,670 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40,670 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3.169 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of liquid water at 25°C is approximately 3.169 kPa."
