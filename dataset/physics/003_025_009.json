    "message_1": "A wire of length 5 cm carrying a current of 2 A is wrapped securely around a cylindrical resistor with a radius of 1 cm. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the cylinder axis? Assume that the resistance of the wire is negligible and the permeability of free space is μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the cylinder axis, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to μ₀ times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns (n) of the wire around the cylindrical resistor. The length of the wire is 5 cm, and the circumference of the cylinder is given by:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the cylinder. In this case, r = 1 cm.\n\nC = 2π(1) = 2π cm\n\nNow, we can find the number of turns by dividing the length of the wire by the circumference of the cylinder:\n\nn = (length of wire) / C\nn = 5 cm / 2π cm ≈ 0.7958 turns\n\nSince the wire is wrapped securely around the cylindrical resistor, we can assume that the current is uniformly distributed around the cylinder. Therefore, the total current enclosed by a loop with a radius of 2 cm is:\n\nI_enclosed = n * I\nI_enclosed = 0.7958 turns * 2 A ≈ 1.5916 A\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the cylinder axis. We will consider a circular loop with a radius of 2 cm. The differential length element dl is tangent to the loop, and the magnetic field B is also tangent to the loop. Therefore, the dot product B⋅dl = B dl.\n\n∮B⋅dl = ∮B dl = B ∮dl = B * (circumference of the loop)\n\nThe circumference of the loop with a radius of 2 cm is:\n\nC_loop = 2π(2) = 4π cm\n\nSo, ∮B dl = B * 4π cm.\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\nB * 4π cm = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A) * 1.5916 A\n\nWe need to convert the distance from cm to m:\n\n4π (0.02 m) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A) * 1.5916 A\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A * 1.5916 A) / (4π * 0.02 m)\nB ≈ 1.5916 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the cylinder axis is approximately 1.5916 × 10⁻⁷ T."
