    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the problem has cylindrical symmetry, it's more convenient to use Ampere's law in integral form. The magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc can be found using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the total current passing through the disc, R is the radius of the disc, and z is the distance from the center of the disc to the point on the axis.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total current passing through the disc. The current density J is given as 10 A/m^2. The total current I can be found by multiplying the current density by the area of the disc:\n\nI = J * π * R^2\nI = 10 A/m^2 * π * (0.2 m)^2\nI = 10 * π * 0.04 A\nI = 1.2566 A\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1.2566 A * (0.2 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.2 m)^2 + (0.3 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB = (1.2566 * 10^(-6) Tm * 0.04 m^2) / (2 * (0.04 m^2 + 0.09 m^2)^(3/2))\nB = (5.0264 * 10^(-8) Tm) / (2 * (0.13 m^2)^(3/2))\nB = (5.0264 * 10^(-8) Tm) / (2 * 0.0131 m^3)\nB ≈ 1.92 * 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc at a distance of 0.3 m from its center is approximately 1.92 * 10^(-6) T."
