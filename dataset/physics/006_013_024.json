    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier in an atom's nucleus, we can use the quantum mechanical tunneling model. The probability of tunneling depends on the barrier's height (V), width (L), and the electron's energy (E). The distance between the electron and the nucleus is related to the width of the barrier.\n\nThe transmission probability (T) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave vector, which can be calculated as:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / h^2)\n\nIn this formula, m is the mass of the electron, h is the reduced Planck's constant, and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nTo calculate the probability of tunneling, you need to know the values of the barrier's height (V), width (L), and the electron's energy (E). These values can vary depending on the specific atom and its nucleus, as well as the electron's position and energy state.\n\nOnce you have the values for V, E, and L, you can plug them into the formulas above to calculate the transmission probability (T), which represents the probability of an electron tunneling through the potential barrier."
