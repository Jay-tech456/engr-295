    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They have been proposed as a possible explanation for the observed dark matter content of the universe. To estimate the mass range of primordial black holes that could account for the dark matter, we need to consider various observational constraints and theoretical models.\n\nThe mass range of PBHs that could explain the observed dark matter content of the universe is still uncertain and subject to ongoing research. However, some studies have suggested that PBHs with masses in the range of 10^(-10) to 10^(-6) solar masses (Mâ˜‰) could potentially account for a significant fraction of the dark matter. This mass range is based on the constraints from various observations, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, gravitational lensing, and the survival of dwarf galaxies.\n\nIt is important to note that the mass range of PBHs that could explain the dark matter content is still a topic of active research and debate among physicists. Further observations and theoretical developments may refine or change the current estimates."
