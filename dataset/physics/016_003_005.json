    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of YBa2Cu3O7, a high-temperature superconductor, is approximately 92 Kelvin (-181°C or -294°F). This is the temperature below which the material exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism.\n\nWhen the temperature is reduced below the critical temperature, the electrical resistance of YBa2Cu3O7 drops to zero, allowing it to conduct electricity without any energy loss. This property makes high-temperature superconductors like YBa2Cu3O7 extremely useful for applications that require efficient energy transfer, such as power transmission lines and magnetic levitation trains.\n\nIn addition to zero electrical resistance, YBa2Cu3O7 also exhibits perfect diamagnetism below its critical temperature. This means that it expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This property allows superconductors to levitate above a magnetic field, which has potential applications in frictionless bearings and magnetic levitation transportation systems.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature of YBa2Cu3O7 is approximately 92 Kelvin, and below this temperature, the material exhibits zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism, which significantly impacts its electrical and magnetic properties."
