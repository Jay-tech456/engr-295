    "message_2": "The expected rate of gravitational wave detections per year by future observatories will be significantly higher than the current rate. Currently, the LIGO and Virgo observatories have detected over 50 gravitational wave events since the first detection in 2015. The rate of detections has been increasing, with the third observing run (O3) yielding 56 candidate events in just one year (April 2019 to March 2020).\n\nFuture observatories, such as the planned LIGO-India and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are expected to further increase the detection rate. LIGO-India, which is expected to be operational by the mid-2020s, will improve the global gravitational wave detection network's sensitivity and sky localization. LISA, planned for launch in the 2030s, will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, enabling the detection of a wider range of sources.\n\nAdvancements in technology that will contribute to future detections include:\n\n1. Improved sensitivity: Upgrades to existing detectors and the development of new detectors with better sensitivity will allow for the detection of fainter and more distant gravitational wave sources.\n\n2. Lower-frequency detection: Space-based observatories like LISA will be able to detect lower-frequency gravitational waves, which are produced by different types of astrophysical events, such as the mergers of supermassive black holes.\n\n3. Better data analysis techniques: Improved algorithms and computational power will enable faster and more accurate identification of gravitational wave signals in the detector data.\n\n4. Enhanced global network: The addition of more detectors around the world will improve the ability to localize the sources of gravitational waves, enabling better follow-up observations with telescopes and other instruments.\n\nThese advancements will have a significant impact on our understanding of the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy provides a new way to observe the cosmos, allowing us to study phenomena that are difficult or impossible to observe using electromagnetic radiation, such as black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. This will help us learn more about the properties of these extreme objects, test our understanding of general relativity, and potentially uncover new physics. Additionally, the improved localization of gravitational wave sources will enable multi-messenger astronomy, where observations across different types of signals (e.g., gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation, and neutrinos) can be combined to provide a more comprehensive understanding of astrophysical events."
