    "message_2": "To find the energy of the first three excited states of a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the energy formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state, 1 for the first excited state, etc.), h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the oscillator.\n\nGiven the frequency (f) of 10 MHz (10 x 10^6 Hz) and a mass (m) of 1 kg, we can find the energy of the first three excited states (n = 1, 2, and 3).\n\nFor n = 1 (first excited state):\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_1 = (3/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (10 x 10^6 Hz)\nE_1 ≈ 9.939 x 10^-27 J\n\nFor n = 2 (second excited state):\nE_2 = (2 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_2 = (5/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (10 x 10^6 Hz)\nE_2 ≈ 1.6565 x 10^-26 J\n\nFor n = 3 (third excited state):\nE_3 = (3 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_3 = (7/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (10 x 10^6 Hz)\nE_3 ≈ 2.319 x 10^-26 J\n\nSo, the energy of the first three excited states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are approximately 9.939 x 10^-27 J, 1.6565 x 10^-26 J, and 2.319 x 10^-26 J, respectively."
