    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a physics student studying the Young's Double Slit Experiment:\n\n\"A double-slit experiment is set up where the distance between the slits is 0.5 mm and the distance between the screen and the slits is 1.5 m. If the wavelength of the light used is 550 nm, calculate the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe on the screen.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe, we can use the formula for the fringe separation in a double-slit experiment:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central maximum and the m-th order bright fringe\nm = order of the fringe (1 for the first-order bright fringe)\nλ = wavelength of the light (550 nm)\nL = distance between the screen and the slits (1.5 m)\nd = distance between the slits (0.5 mm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units to be consistent. Let's convert the distance between the slits to meters:\n\n0.5 mm = 0.5 * 10^(-3) m = 5 * 10^(-4) m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ny = (1 * 550 * 10^(-9) * 1.5) / (5 * 10^(-4))\ny = (825 * 10^(-9)) / (5 * 10^(-4))\ny = 1.65 * 10^(-3) m\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe is 1.65 mm."
