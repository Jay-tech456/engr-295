    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom, we need to consider the transition from the first excited state (n = 2) to the ground state (n = 1). This transition is accompanied by the emission of a photon, and the process is known as spontaneous emission.\n\nThe lifetime of the first excited state can be calculated using the Einstein A-coefficient, which represents the probability of spontaneous emission per unit time. For the hydrogen atom, the A-coefficient for the transition from n = 2 to n = 1 is given by:\n\nA_21 = 6.3 x 10^8 s^-1\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of the first excited state is the inverse of the A-coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A_21\n\nPlugging in the value of A_21, we get:\n\nτ = 1 / (6.3 x 10^8 s^-1) ≈ 1.59 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.59 x 10^-9 seconds.\n\nUnderstanding the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. It provides insight into the atomic structure of hydrogen, as the lifetime is directly related to the energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state. This energy difference corresponds to the energy of the emitted photon during the transition, which can be observed as a spectral line in the hydrogen spectrum (the Lyman-alpha line).\n\n2. The lifetime of the first excited state also helps us understand the natural linewidth of the spectral line. The uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. Since the lifetime of the excited state represents the uncertainty in time, this relationship can be used to calculate the uncertainty in energy, which corresponds to the natural linewidth of the spectral line.\n\n3. The lifetime of the first excited state is also important in understanding various phenomena in astrophysics, such as the recombination of hydrogen in the early universe and the absorption and emission of radiation by hydrogen in interstellar space.\n\nIn summary, the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.59 x 10^-9 seconds. This information is crucial for understanding the atomic structure of hydrogen, the natural linewidth of spectral lines, and various astrophysical phenomena involving hydrogen."
