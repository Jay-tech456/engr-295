    "message_2": "The relationship between magnetic susceptibility (χ) and temperature (T) in a sample of iron can be described by the Curie-Weiss Law. The Curie-Weiss Law states that the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic material is inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature and the Curie temperature (Tc) of the material. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ is the magnetic susceptibility, T is the temperature, Tc is the Curie temperature, and C is the Curie constant.\n\nIron is a ferromagnetic material below its Curie temperature (Tc ≈ 770°C or 1043 K). In this state, the magnetic moments of the atoms in the material align parallel to each other, resulting in a strong net magnetization. As the temperature increases and approaches the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility increases, reaching a maximum value at Tc.\n\nWhen the temperature exceeds the Curie temperature, iron undergoes a phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. In the paramagnetic state, the magnetic moments of the atoms become randomly oriented due to thermal agitation, resulting in a weak net magnetization. The magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic state follows the Curie Law, which is given by:\n\nχ = C / T\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant and T is the temperature.\n\nIn summary, the magnetic susceptibility of iron increases as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature, reaching a maximum value at Tc. Above the Curie temperature, iron transitions from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state, and its magnetic susceptibility decreases with increasing temperature."
