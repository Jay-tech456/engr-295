    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nN = 100 turns\nI = 1 A\nR = 0.2 m\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 100 * 1 A) / (2 * 0.2 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁵ Tm) / 0.4 m\n\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁴ T) / 0.4 m\n\nB ≈ 3.1415 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil is approximately 3.1415 × 10⁻⁴ T (tesla)."
