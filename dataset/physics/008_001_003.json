    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles through various decay modes. The probability of each decay mode is given by its branching ratio.\n\nHere are the main decay modes of the Higgs boson and their approximate branching ratios:\n\n1. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (b and anti-b quarks):\n   Branching ratio: ~58%\n\n2. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-):\n   Branching ratio: ~21%\n\n3. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons (tau+ and tau-):\n   Branching ratio: ~6.3%\n\n4. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of charm quarks (c and anti-c quarks):\n   Branching ratio: ~2.9%\n\n5. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of Z bosons (Z and Z):\n   Branching ratio: ~2.6%\n\n6. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of gluons (g and g) through a loop of top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~2.3%\n\n7. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons (γ and γ) through a loop of W bosons or top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~0.23%\n\n8. Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson and a photon (Z and γ) through a loop of W bosons or top quarks:\n   Branching ratio: ~0.015%\n\n9. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of muons (mu+ and mu-):\n   Branching ratio: ~0.021%\n\n10. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of electrons (e+ and e-):\n    Branching ratio: negligible\n\nThese branching ratios are approximate and can vary slightly depending on the specific Higgs boson mass and other factors. The most dominant decay modes are into bottom quarks and W bosons, while the decays into photons and Z boson-photon pairs are relatively rare. The LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, have observed several of these decay modes, providing crucial evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson and its properties."
