    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the focal length of a concave mirror that produces an upright image that is twice the size of the object placed 10 cm in front of the mirror. Assuming the mirror is thin, what is its focal length?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula for concave mirrors.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nGiven that the image is upright and twice the size of the object, the magnification (M) is 2. Since the image is upright, it must be a virtual image, so the image distance (v) will be positive. The object distance (u) is -10 cm (negative because it is in front of the mirror).\n\nUsing the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n2 = -v/(-10)\nv = 20 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the focal length (f):\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/f = 1/(-10) + 1/20\n1/f = (-1 + 2)/20\n1/f = 1/20\n\nTherefore, the focal length (f) of the concave mirror is:\nf = 20 cm"
