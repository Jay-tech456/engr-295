    "message_2": "The strong nuclear force, also known as the strong force or strong interaction, is one of the four fundamental forces in nature. It is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus.\n\nThe range of the strong nuclear force is quite short, typically around 1 to 3 femtometers (1 femtometer = 10^-15 meters). This is roughly the size of an atomic nucleus. Due to its short range, the strong force is effective only at very close distances between particles, such as protons and neutrons within the nucleus.\n\nThe strong force does not vary linearly with the energies of the particles involved. Instead, it exhibits a property called \"asymptotic freedom.\" This means that the strong force becomes weaker as the energy of the interacting particles increases (or as the distance between the particles decreases). Conversely, the strong force becomes stronger as the energy of the particles decreases (or as the distance between the particles increases), but only up to a certain point, beyond which the force drops off rapidly and becomes negligible.\n\nIn summary, the range of the strong nuclear force is about 1 to 3 femtometers, and its strength varies with the energies of the particles involved, becoming weaker at higher energies and stronger at lower energies within its effective range."
