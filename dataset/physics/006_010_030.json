    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of energy principle and the Coulomb's law. The initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle is converted into potential energy at the point of closest approach.\n\nLet's denote the following variables:\n- m = mass of the alpha particle\n- v = initial velocity of the alpha particle (2.0 x 10^6 m/s)\n- q1 = charge of the alpha particle (+2e)\n- q2 = charge of the gold nucleus (+79e)\n- e = elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C)\n- k = Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2)\n- r = distance of closest approach\n\nThe mass of an alpha particle is approximately 6.64 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy (KE) of the alpha particle is given by:\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nAt the point of closest approach, the potential energy (PE) between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus is given by Coulomb's law:\nPE = k * q1 * q2 / r\n\nSince the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy at the point of closest approach, we can equate the two expressions:\n0.5 * m * v^2 = k * q1 * q2 / r\n\nNow we can solve for r:\nr = (k * q1 * q2) / (0.5 * m * v^2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nr = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2 * 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C * 79 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C) / (0.5 * 6.64 x 10^-27 kg * (2.0 x 10^6 m/s)^2)\n\nr â‰ˆ 2.31 x 10^-14 m\n\nSo, the distance of closest approach between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus in the Rutherford scattering experiment is approximately 2.31 x 10^-14 meters."
