    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point near a current-carrying wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. In this case, we will use Ampere's Law, which is more straightforward for a straight wire. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength (in tesla, T)\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (in amperes, A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (in meters)\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nI = 4 A\nr = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 * 10^(-7) Tm * 4) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (16 * 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = (16 / 0.04) * 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 400 * 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 4 * 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the wire is approximately 4 * 10^(-5) T or 40 μT."
