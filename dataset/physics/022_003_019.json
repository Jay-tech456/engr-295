    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. There are several key pieces of evidence that suggest the existence of dark matter in galaxies:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: According to Newton's laws, the velocity of stars orbiting around the center of a galaxy should decrease as their distance from the center increases. However, observations of galaxy rotation curves show that the velocities of stars remain constant or even increase with distance from the center. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, unseen component – dark matter – that provides the additional gravitational force needed to maintain the observed velocities.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant galaxy passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, its path is bent. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to map the distribution of mass within the lensing object. Observations of gravitational lensing have revealed that the mass distribution in galaxy clusters is much more extensive than what can be accounted for by visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to infer the distribution of matter at that time. The observed pattern of fluctuations is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter and 5% ordinary (visible) matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match the observed large-scale structure of the universe. Simulations without dark matter fail to reproduce the observed structures.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter within galaxies is not uniform and is generally found to be more extended than the distribution of visible matter. Dark matter is believed to form a roughly spherical halo around galaxies, with the density decreasing as the distance from the center of the galaxy increases. This distribution is consistent with the observed galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing effects. The exact nature of dark matter and its relationship to visible matter is still an open question in physics, and ongoing research aims to better understand this mysterious component of the universe."
