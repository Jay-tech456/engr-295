    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 5 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 9.945 × 10^30 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 1.47 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14,700 meters or 14.7 kilometers.\n\nThe event horizon radius for a non-rotating black hole is the same as the Schwarzschild radius. Therefore, the event horizon radius for this black hole is also approximately 14,700 meters or 14.7 kilometers."
