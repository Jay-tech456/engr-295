    "message_2": "The waveform of gravitational waves produced by a spinning black hole accretion disk differs from that of a non-spinning black hole accretion disk mainly due to the effects of the black hole's spin on the surrounding spacetime and the dynamics of the accretion disk.\n\nIn the case of a spinning black hole, the black hole's rotation causes a phenomenon known as frame-dragging, which affects the motion of particles and gas in the accretion disk. This leads to a more complex and asymmetric distribution of matter in the disk, which in turn results in a more intricate pattern of gravitational wave emission. The waveform produced by a spinning black hole accretion disk will generally have higher harmonics and a more variable amplitude and frequency compared to a non-spinning black hole accretion disk.\n\nOn the other hand, a non-spinning black hole accretion disk will have a more symmetric distribution of matter, leading to a simpler waveform with fewer harmonics and a more constant amplitude and frequency.\n\nTo distinguish between the waveforms produced by spinning and non-spinning black hole accretion disks, one can analyze the gravitational wave signal for the presence of higher harmonics and variations in amplitude and frequency. Additionally, comparing the observed waveform to theoretical models and simulations of spinning and non-spinning black hole accretion disks can help to identify the specific characteristics of the system that produced the gravitational waves.\n\nIt is important to note that detecting and analyzing gravitational waves from accretion disks is still a challenging task, as the signals are typically weaker than those produced by other astrophysical events, such as binary black hole or neutron star mergers. However, with the continuous improvement of gravitational wave detectors and data analysis techniques, it is expected that the study of gravitational waves from accretion disks will become increasingly feasible in the future."
