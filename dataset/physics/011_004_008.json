    "message_1": "A certain material has a thermal conductivity of 0.025 W/mK at a temperature of 300 K. If the temperature of this material is increased to 500 K, what will be its new thermal conductivity?",
    "message_2": "To determine the new thermal conductivity of the material at 500 K, we need to know how the thermal conductivity changes with temperature. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem statement.\n\nThermal conductivity can be temperature-dependent, and the relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature can be different for different materials. Some materials may have a linear relationship, while others may have a more complex relationship.\n\nWithout knowing the specific relationship between thermal conductivity and temperature for this material, it is not possible to determine its new thermal conductivity at 500 K."
