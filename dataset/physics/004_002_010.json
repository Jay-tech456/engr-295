    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe mass of our sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 * 1.989 × 10^30) / 9 × 10^16\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * 1.327 × 10^20) / 9 × 10^16\n\nr_s ≈ 2.654 × 10^20 / 9 × 10^16\n\nr_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass equal to that of our sun is approximately 2.95 kilometers."
