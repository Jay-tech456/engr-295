    "message_2": "The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (radius of the event horizon), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is equivalent to that of our sun, we can use the solar mass (M_sun) as the mass in the formula. The solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, and the speed of light c is approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nR_s = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 * 1.989 x 10^30) / (8.988 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ (13.28 x 10^19) / (8.988 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ 1.477 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole with a mass equivalent to that of our sun is approximately 1,477 meters or 1.477 kilometers."
