    "message_2": "To find the internal energy of the gas when it reaches a final volume of 6 L, we first need to determine the work done by the gas during the expansion. We can use the formula for work done by a gas at constant pressure:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nGiven that the pressure is 5 atm and the volume change is from 2 L to 6 L, we can convert the pressure to pascals (Pa) using the conversion factor 1 atm = 101325 Pa:\n\nP = 5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 506625 Pa\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial = 6 L - 2 L = 4 L\n\nWe need to convert the volume from liters to cubic meters (m³) using the conversion factor 1 L = 0.001 m³:\n\nΔV = 4 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.004 m³\n\nNow we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = P * ΔV = 506625 Pa * 0.004 m³ = 2026.5 J\n\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nWe are given that the internal energy of the gas increases by 300 J during the expansion:\n\nΔU = 300 J\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to find the heat added to the system:\n\nQ = ΔU + W = 300 J + 2026.5 J = 2326.5 J\n\nNow, we need to find the initial internal energy (U_initial) of the gas. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the initial internal energy without more information about the gas, such as its temperature or specific heat capacity.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the problem is asking for the final internal energy (U_final) after the expansion, we can use the change in internal energy (ΔU) to find it:\n\nU_final = U_initial + ΔU\n\nSince we know that ΔU = 300 J, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nU_final = U_initial + 300 J\n\nWithout knowing the initial internal energy (U_initial), we cannot provide a numerical value for the final internal energy (U_final). However, we can say that the final internal energy is 300 J greater than the initial internal energy:\n\nU_final = U_initial + 300 J"
