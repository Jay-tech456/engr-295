    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is long and rectangular, we can integrate the magnetic field contributions from each small current element along the width of the wire. Let's consider a small current element at a distance x from the left edge of the wire. The position vector r from this current element to the point 10 cm above the center of the wire is:\n\nr = <x, 10>\n\nThe length element dl is in the direction of the current, which is from bottom to top:\n\ndl = <0, dy>\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = <0, 0, x * dy>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + 10^2)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * x * dy) / (x^2 + 10^2)^(3/2)\n\nSince the magnetic field is in the z-direction, we can integrate this expression along the width of the wire (from x = 0 to x = 5 cm) to find the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 2 * ∫(x dx) / (x^2 + 10^2)^(3/2) from 0 to 5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution. Let u = x^2 + 10^2, then du = 2x dx:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(du / 2u^(3/2)) from u = 10^2 to u = 5^2 + 10^2\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(du / u^(3/2)) from u = 100 to u = 125\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * [-2u^(-1/2)] from u = 100 to u = 125\n\nB = (-μ₀ / 2π) * (1/sqrt(125) - 1/sqrt(100))\n\nB = (-4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 2π) * (1/5 - 1/10)\n\nB = (-2 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1/5)\n\nB = -4 × 10^(-8) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point 10 cm above the center of the wire is -4 × 10^(-8) T in the z-direction. The negative sign indicates that the magnetic field is pointing into the page."
