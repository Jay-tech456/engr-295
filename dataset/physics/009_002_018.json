    "message_1": "A ray of light travels from water to air with an angle of incidence of 60°. If the refractive index of water is 1.33 and that of air is 1.00, what is the angle of refraction?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (water and air, respectively), θ1 is the angle of incidence (60°), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nWe are given n1 = 1.33 (water) and n2 = 1.00 (air), and we want to find θ2. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n(1.33) * sin(60°) = (1.00) * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.33) * sin(60°) / (1.00)\nsin(θ2) ≈ 1.15\n\nSince the sine function cannot be greater than 1, this result indicates that there is a total internal reflection occurring, and the light does not refract into the air. Instead, it reflects back into the water."
