The system consists of a sender and a receiver, and the information is encoded using a 5-qubit code. During the transmission, one of the qubits gets corrupted due to the external noise. Determine the syndrome measurements to detect and correct the error, and explain how the receiver can decode the information correctly with the help of quantum error correction code.",
    "message_2": "Solution: In a quantum communication system, quantum error correction codes are used to protect the quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. In this problem, we are given a 5-qubit code, which means that the information is encoded in a state of 5 qubits. Let's assume that the sender encodes the information in a state |ψ⟩, which is a superposition of the basis states of the 5 qubits.\n\nWhen one of the qubits gets corrupted during the transmission, the state of the system changes to a new state |ψ'⟩. To detect and correct the error, the receiver needs to perform syndrome measurements on the received state |ψ'⟩. Syndrome measurements are a set of non-destructive measurements that provide information about the error without revealing the actual information encoded in the state.\n\nFor a 5-qubit code, we can use the Shor code, which is a quantum error-correcting code that can correct for arbitrary single-qubit errors. The Shor code uses 9 qubits to encode a single logical qubit, but for simplicity, we will consider a 5-qubit version that can correct for single bit-flip errors. The encoding circuit for the 5-qubit code is as follows:\n\n1. Prepare the initial state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex coefficients.\n2. Apply a Hadamard gate on the first qubit to create the state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2.\n3. Apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target to create the state α|00⟩ + β|11⟩.\n4. Apply another CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the third qubit as the target to create the state α|000⟩ + β|111⟩.\n5. Apply a Hadamard gate on the fourth qubit to create the state (α|000⟩ + β|111⟩)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2.\n6. Apply a CNOT gate with the fourth qubit as the control and the fifth qubit as the target to create the state α|00000⟩ + β|11111⟩.\n\nNow, the receiver needs to perform syndrome measurements to detect the error. The syndrome measurements for the 5-qubit code are the following:\n\n1. Measure the parity of the first three qubits using a multi-qubit parity measurement. If the parity is even, there is no error in the first three qubits. If the parity is odd, there is an error in one of the first three qubits.\n2. Measure the parity of the last two qubits using a two-qubit parity measurement. If the parity is even, there is no error in the last two qubits. If the parity is odd, there is an error in one of the last two qubits.\n\nBased on the results of the syndrome measurements, the receiver can determine which qubit has been corrupted and apply a bit-flip correction operation (X gate) to correct the error. After correcting the error, the receiver can decode the information by reversing the encoding circuit:\n\n1. Apply a CNOT gate with the fourth qubit as the control and the fifth qubit as the target.\n2. Apply a Hadamard gate on the fourth qubit.\n3. Apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the third qubit as the target.\n4. Apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target.\n5. Apply a Hadamard gate on the first qubit.\n\nAfter decoding, the receiver will obtain the original state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, and the information can be extracted correctly."
