    "message_2": "To find the energy of a particle with rest mass 1 GeV/c^2 traveling at a speed of 0.8c, we can use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the particle. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, we can find the total energy:\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = (1.667)(1 GeV/c^2)(c^2)\nE ≈ 1.667 GeV\n\nSo, the energy of the particle is approximately 1.667 GeV."
