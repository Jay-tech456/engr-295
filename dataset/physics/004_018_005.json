    "message_2": "Gravitational redshift, also known as gravitational redshift of light or gravitational redshift of frequency, is a phenomenon that occurs when light or other electromagnetic radiation travels away from a massive object such as a star or planet. The effect is a consequence of General Relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass.\n\nIn General Relativity, the presence of a massive object causes the spacetime around it to curve, and this curvature affects the path and properties of light traveling through it. When light moves away from a massive object, it has to \"climb\" out of the gravitational potential well created by the object. As a result, the light loses energy, and its frequency decreases. This decrease in frequency corresponds to an increase in the wavelength of the light, causing it to shift towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This shift in wavelength is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nThe gravitational redshift effect can be quantified using the formula:\n\nz = (ν₁ - ν₂) / ν₂\n\nwhere z is the redshift, ν₁ is the frequency of the light when it is emitted, and ν₂ is the frequency of the light when it is observed. The relationship between the redshift and the change in gravitational potential is given by:\n\nz = ΔΦ / c²\n\nwhere ΔΦ is the change in gravitational potential between the point of emission and the point of observation, and c is the speed of light.\n\nA real-life example of gravitational redshift can be observed in the light emitted by stars. The light emitted by a star has to travel through the curved spacetime created by the star's mass. As the light moves away from the star, it loses energy due to the gravitational redshift effect, causing its wavelength to increase and its color to shift towards the red end of the spectrum. This effect has been experimentally verified through various observations, such as the Pound-Rebka experiment in 1959, which measured the gravitational redshift of gamma rays emitted by a radioactive source in a laboratory on Earth.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational redshift effect is a phenomenon in which light or other electromagnetic radiation traveling away from a massive object experiences a decrease in frequency and an increase in wavelength due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the object's mass. This effect is a direct consequence of General Relativity and can be observed in the light emitted by stars and other celestial bodies."
