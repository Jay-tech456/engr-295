    "message_2": "Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with the highest energy and shortest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. In theory, there is no strict upper limit to the energy that gamma rays can possess. However, in practice, the highest energy gamma rays observed so far are in the range of several hundred tera-electron volts (TeV) or even peta-electron volts (PeV).\n\nScientists detect and study high-energy gamma rays in space using specialized telescopes and instruments. There are two main techniques for detecting gamma rays:\n\n1. Satellite-based detectors: These detectors are placed on satellites orbiting the Earth, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Satellite-based detectors use instruments like the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) to detect gamma rays directly. The LAT detects gamma rays by tracking the electron-positron pairs produced when gamma rays interact with the detector's material. The GBM detects gamma rays using scintillation detectors, which emit light when struck by gamma rays or other high-energy particles.\n\n2. Ground-based detectors: These detectors are located on Earth and detect gamma rays indirectly by observing the secondary particles produced when gamma rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. Examples of ground-based detectors include the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). These detectors use arrays of Cherenkov telescopes to detect the Cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary particles produced in the atmosphere. By analyzing the patterns of Cherenkov radiation, scientists can determine the energy and direction of the original gamma rays.\n\nBoth satellite-based and ground-based detectors have contributed significantly to our understanding of high-energy gamma rays and their sources, such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts. These observations help scientists study extreme astrophysical processes and test fundamental physics theories."
