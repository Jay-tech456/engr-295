    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for the Higgs mechanism, which gives mass to other particles. The Higgs boson itself is unstable and decays into other particles shortly after being produced.\n\nThe average lifetime (τ) of a Higgs boson particle is related to its decay width (Γ) through the following relation:\n\nτ = ħ / Γ\n\nHere, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^(-16) eV s.\n\nThe decay width of the Higgs boson depends on the mass of the particle and the decay channels available to it. For a Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV, as discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the theoretical decay width is predicted to be around 4.07 MeV within the Standard Model.\n\nUsing the relation between the decay width and the average lifetime, we can calculate the average lifetime of the Higgs boson:\n\nτ = (6.582 × 10^(-16) eV s) / (4.07 MeV) ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-22) s\n\nThe current experimental measurement of the Higgs boson lifetime is challenging due to its extremely short lifetime. However, the experimental measurements of the Higgs boson properties, including its decay width, are consistent with the theoretical predictions within the Standard Model. The LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, continue to collect data and refine their measurements to improve the precision and test the Standard Model predictions further."
