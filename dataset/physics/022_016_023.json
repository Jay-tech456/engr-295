    "message_1": "What is the predicted mass range of sterile neutrinos that could account for the observed dark matter in the universe, and how does this compare to the mass of known neutrinos? Also, what experimental methods have been proposed or used to search for these elusive particles?",
    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through any of the known fundamental forces except gravity. They have been proposed as a possible candidate for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nThe predicted mass range of sterile neutrinos that could account for the observed dark matter in the universe is still uncertain. However, it is generally believed that their mass should be in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) range, typically between 1 keV and 50 keV. This is much larger than the mass of known neutrinos, which are in the sub-eV (electronvolt) range.\n\nSeveral experimental methods have been proposed or used to search for sterile neutrinos. Some of these methods include:\n\n1. Direct detection: This involves searching for the decay products of sterile neutrinos, such as X-rays or gamma rays. One example is the X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) experiment, which has been used to search for X-ray emission from sterile neutrino decays in the Milky Way.\n\n2. Indirect detection: This involves looking for the effects of sterile neutrinos on astrophysical objects or cosmological observables. For example, the Lyman-alpha forest, which is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, can be used to probe the distribution of dark matter on small scales. If sterile neutrinos make up a significant fraction of dark matter, their presence could affect the observed distribution of the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce sterile neutrinos through the mixing with known neutrinos. The subsequent decay of these sterile neutrinos could then be detected in the collider's detectors.\n\n4. Neutrino oscillation experiments: Neutrino oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a neutrino of one flavor (electron, muon, or tau) can transform into a neutrino of another flavor. If sterile neutrinos exist, they could potentially mix with the known neutrinos, leading to observable deviations from the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation pattern. Experiments like MINOS, IceCube, and T2K have been used to search for such deviations.\n\n5. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe and contains information about the composition and evolution of the universe. The presence of sterile neutrinos could affect the CMB power spectrum, and precise measurements of the CMB, such as those provided by the Planck satellite, can be used to constrain the properties of sterile neutrinos.\n\nDespite these experimental efforts, sterile neutrinos have not been conclusively detected yet. Further research and more sensitive experiments are needed to either confirm or rule out their existence and their role in the dark matter puzzle."
