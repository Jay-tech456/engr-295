    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of a cubic crystal, we can use the Grüneisen equation:\n\nα = (γ * ΔT) / (V * K)\n\nwhere γ is the Grüneisen parameter, ΔT is the change in temperature, V is the volume of the unit cell, and K is the bulk modulus.\n\nThe Grüneisen parameter (γ) can be estimated using the Debye temperature (Θ_D) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) as follows:\n\nγ = (C_V * Θ_D) / (3 * K * V)\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the volume of the unit cell (V) can be calculated using the lattice constant (a):\n\nV = a^3\n\nGiven the lattice constant (a) of 0.5 nm, we can calculate the volume of the unit cell:\n\nV = (0.5 * 10^(-9))^3 = 1.25 * 10^(-28) m^3\n\nThe change in temperature (ΔT) is given as 100 °C - 25 °C = 75 °C = 75 K.\n\nThe Debye temperature (Θ_D) is given as 400 K.\n\nTo proceed, we need to estimate the bulk modulus (K) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (C_V). Unfortunately, these values are not provided in the problem statement, and they are material-dependent. Therefore, we cannot calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) without this information.\n\nIf you can provide the bulk modulus (K) and the specific heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) for the cubic crystal, we can then calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α)."
