    "message_1": "A coaxial cable of length 2 meters carries a current of 3 A. The cable has an inner diameter of 1 mm and an outer diameter of 3 mm. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 1 cm away from the coaxial cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located 1 cm away from the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's find the current enclosed by the loop at a distance of 1 cm from the cable. Since the current is uniformly distributed in the cable, we can find the current enclosed by the loop by calculating the ratio of the areas of the cross-sections of the cable and the loop.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the inner conductor (A_inner) is given by:\n\nA_inner = π(D_inner/2)²\nA_inner = π(1 mm/2)²\nA_inner = π(0.5 mm)²\nA_inner = π(0.0005 m)²\nA_inner ≈ 7.85 × 10⁻¹⁰ m²\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the outer conductor (A_outer) is given by:\n\nA_outer = π(D_outer/2)²\nA_outer = π(3 mm/2)²\nA_outer = π(1.5 mm)²\nA_outer = π(0.0015 m)²\nA_outer ≈ 7.07 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nNow, let's find the cross-sectional area of the loop at a distance of 1 cm from the cable (A_loop):\n\nA_loop = π(r_loop)²\nA_loop = π(1 cm)²\nA_loop = π(0.01 m)²\nA_loop ≈ 3.14 × 10⁻⁴ m²\n\nThe ratio of the areas (R) is given by:\n\nR = (A_inner + A_outer) / A_loop\nR ≈ (7.85 × 10⁻¹⁰ m² + 7.07 × 10⁻⁶ m²) / (3.14 × 10⁻⁴ m²)\nR ≈ 2.25 × 10⁻²\n\nNow, we can find the current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed):\n\nI_enclosed = R × I\nI_enclosed = 2.25 × 10⁻² × 3 A\nI_enclosed ≈ 0.0675 A\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 1 cm from the cable. We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nB × 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWhere r is the distance from the cable (1 cm = 0.01 m), and μ₀ is the permeability of free space (μ₀ ≈ 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A).\n\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / (2πr)\nB ≈ (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 0.0675 A) / (2π × 0.01 m)\nB ≈ 9.02 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 1 cm away from the coaxial cable is approximately 9.02 × 10⁻⁶ T (Tesla)."
