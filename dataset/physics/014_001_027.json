    "message_2": "The ratio of dark matter to visible (or baryonic) matter in our universe is approximately 5:1. This means that for every unit of visible matter, there are about five units of dark matter. This ratio is derived from various observations and measurements, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy rotation curves, and large-scale structure formation.\n\nThe presence of dark matter affects the expansion rate of the universe in several ways. First, dark matter contributes to the overall mass-energy content of the universe, which influences the expansion rate through the Friedmann equations in the context of general relativity. The higher the mass-energy content, the slower the expansion rate would be, all else being equal.\n\nSecond, dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. It acts as a gravitational scaffolding that allows visible matter to clump together and form these structures. The formation of these structures can affect the expansion rate of the universe by altering the distribution of matter and energy.\n\nFinally, the ratio of dark matter to visible matter can also influence the expansion rate indirectly through its impact on the cosmological constant (or dark energy). Dark energy is the dominant factor driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. If the ratio of dark matter to visible matter were different, it could potentially alter the balance between dark energy and the overall mass-energy content of the universe, leading to a different expansion rate.\n\nIn summary, the 5:1 ratio of dark matter to visible matter in our universe plays a significant role in determining the expansion rate of the universe by contributing to its mass-energy content, facilitating the formation of large-scale structures, and influencing the balance between dark energy and other forms of mass-energy."
