    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It is invisible to electromagnetic radiation, which means it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it extremely difficult to detect. One of the proposed candidates for dark matter is dark photons, which are hypothetical particles that are similar to ordinary photons but do not interact with ordinary matter through the electromagnetic force.\n\nThe relationship between the predicted particle properties of dark matter composed of dark photons and the experimental data currently available is still uncertain. There are several experiments and observations that provide indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. However, these observations do not specifically point to dark photons as the primary constituent of dark matter.\n\nDirect detection experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various underground detectors, are currently searching for dark matter particles, including dark photons. So far, these experiments have not provided conclusive evidence for the existence of dark photons, but they have helped to constrain the possible properties of these particles, such as their mass and interaction strength with ordinary matter.\n\nIn summary, while there is strong indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter, the specific particle properties of dark matter composed of dark photons are still uncertain. Experimental data has not yet provided conclusive evidence for the existence of dark photons, but ongoing research and experiments continue to refine our understanding of their possible properties and interactions with ordinary matter."
