    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular current-carrying loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a circular loop with radius R and current I, we can integrate the magnetic field contributions from all the small current elements around the loop. Let's consider a point P on the axis of the loop at a distance z from the center of the loop. The magnetic field at point P due to the entire loop can be found by integrating the contributions from all the small current elements.\n\nThe magnetic field dB at point P due to a small current element at an angle θ on the loop is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ) * R) / (R² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire loop (from θ = 0 to θ = 2π) gives the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field at point P is parallel to the axis of the loop. If the current is flowing in the clockwise direction when viewed from point P, the magnetic field will be pointing downward along the axis. If the current is flowing in the counterclockwise direction, the magnetic field will be pointing upward along the axis.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular current-carrying loop with radius R and current I, located at a distance z from the center of the loop, is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field depends on the direction of the current in the loop and is parallel to the axis of the loop."
