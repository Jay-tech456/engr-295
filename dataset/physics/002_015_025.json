    "message_1": "A heat pump is used to maintain a room temperature of 20°C while the outside temperature is 3°C. The heat pump moves 1500 J of heat from the outside environment to the inside for every 1000 J of work done. What is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat energy transferred to the inside (Q_in) to the work done (W) by the heat pump. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_in / W\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the heat pump moves 1500 J of heat from the outside environment to the inside (Q_in = 1500 J) for every 1000 J of work done (W = 1000 J).\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient of performance:\n\nCOP = Q_in / W\nCOP = 1500 J / 1000 J\n\nCOP = 1.5\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 1.5."
