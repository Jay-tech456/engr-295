    "message_2": "According to the theory of general relativity, the deflection angle (α) of light passing near a massive object like a galaxy can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the massive object, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter, which represents the closest distance between the light path and the center of the massive object.\n\nGravitational lensing is the observed phenomenon where the light from a distant object, such as a star or galaxy, is bent as it passes near a massive object, like another galaxy or a black hole. This bending of light causes the distant object to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nThe deflection angle predicted by general relativity leads to gravitational lensing because the massive object's gravity warps the spacetime around it, causing the light to follow a curved path. As a result, the light appears to come from a different direction than it would if the massive object were not present. This change in the apparent position of the distant object creates the lensing effect, which can be used to study the distribution of mass in the universe, detect dark matter, and even discover exoplanets."
