    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol)\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe know the vapor pressure of water at 100 °C (373.15 K) is 101.3 kPa (1 atm). We want to find the vapor pressure at 25 °C (298.15 K). We can rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol K * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.3 * exp(-40,700 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3.17 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C is approximately 3.17 kPa."
