    "message_2": "The piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon where certain materials, such as crystals, generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress. This effect is reversible, meaning that when an electric field is applied to the material, it will undergo a mechanical deformation.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect in a crystal changes with different external forces in the following ways:\n\n1. Magnitude of the force: As the magnitude of the applied force increases, the amount of electric charge generated within the crystal also increases. This relationship is typically linear, meaning that if the force is doubled, the generated charge will also double.\n\n2. Direction of the force: The direction of the applied force also affects the piezoelectric effect. In some crystal orientations, the force may generate a larger charge, while in other orientations, it may generate a smaller charge or even no charge at all. This is due to the anisotropic nature of the piezoelectric effect, which depends on the crystal structure and the direction of the applied force.\n\n3. Frequency of the force: The frequency of the applied force can also affect the piezoelectric effect. At certain frequencies, the crystal may resonate, leading to an increased piezoelectric response. This is known as the resonance frequency and is specific to the crystal's dimensions and material properties.\n\nThe relationship between the external forces and the resulting charge distribution within the crystal can be described by the piezoelectric equations. These equations relate the mechanical stress (force) applied to the crystal to the electric displacement (charge) generated within the material. The piezoelectric equations are given by:\n\nD = d * T + ε * E\nS = s * T + d * E\n\nWhere:\n- D is the electric displacement (charge)\n- T is the mechanical stress (force)\n- E is the electric field\n- S is the mechanical strain (deformation)\n- d is the piezoelectric coefficient matrix\n- ε is the permittivity matrix\n- s is the compliance matrix\n\nThese equations show that the charge distribution within the crystal (D) depends on the applied force (T) and the piezoelectric coefficient matrix (d). The piezoelectric coefficient matrix is a property of the crystal material and describes how the material responds to mechanical stress in terms of generating an electric charge."
