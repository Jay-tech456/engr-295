    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop to the current (I) passing through the loop. For a long solenoid (inductor coil), the magnetic field inside the solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nHowever, we are given the radius of the coil (10 cm) and the distance from the center of the coil (5 cm), which means we are looking for the magnetic field strength at a point outside the solenoid. In this case, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire at a point along its axis:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nI = 4 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * (0.1 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.1 m)^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * 0.01 m^2) / (2 * (0.01 m^2 + 0.0025 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (5.0265 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (2 * (0.0125 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (5.0265 × 10^(-6) Tm) / (2 * 0.0277 m^2)\n\nB ≈ 9.06 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the coil is approximately 9.06 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
