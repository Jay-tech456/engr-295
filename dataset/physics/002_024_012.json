    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used to calculate the change in vapor pressure with respect to temperature for a substance undergoing a phase transition. The equation is given by:\n\nd(ln(P)) / dT = ΔHvap / (RT^2)\n\nwhere:\n- P is the vapor pressure\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n- ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol in this case)\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we want to find the change in vapor pressure with respect to temperature, so we will differentiate the equation with respect to T:\n\ndP/dT = (ΔHvap * P) / (RT^2)\n\nWe are given the initial vapor pressure (P1) at 25°C as 3.17 kPa. We need to convert this to Pa:\n\nP1 = 3.17 kPa * 1000 = 3170 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\ndP/dT = (40.7 * 10^3 J/mol * 3170 Pa) / (8.314 J/mol·K * (298.15 K)^2)\n\ndP/dT ≈ 0.0436 Pa/K\n\nThis is the change in vapor pressure of water with respect to temperature at 25°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation."
