    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometry of the situation and the properties of light. We can use the formula for the solid angle subtended by a circular aperture (the pupil in this case) at a distance R:\n\nΩ = π * (d/2)^2 / R^2\n\nwhere Ω is the solid angle, d is the diameter of the pupil (2.5 mm), and R is the distance between the light source and the eye.\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of photons per second (N) that the light source emits. Since we are given that the light intensity is equivalent to a minimum of one photon per second, N = 1.\n\nThe number of photons per second that enter the eye can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nN_eye = N * Ω / (4 * π)\n\nSince we want to find the maximum distance at which the eye can detect the light, we need to find the distance R when N_eye = 1:\n\n1 = 1 * Ω / (4 * π)\n\nΩ = 4 * π\n\nNow, we can substitute the formula for the solid angle into the equation:\n\n4 * π = π * (d/2)^2 / R^2\n\nR^2 = (d/2)^2\n\nR = d/2\n\nR = (2.5 mm) / 2 = 1.25 mm\n\nHowever, this result is not physically meaningful, as it implies that the light source would need to be extremely close to the eye for the retina to detect it. This is because we have assumed that the light source emits only one photon per second, which is an extremely low intensity. In reality, light sources emit a much higher number of photons per second, allowing the human eye to detect them at much greater distances."
