    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we need to use the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = n * q * μ\n\nwhere n is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, q is the charge of an electron (1.6 x 10^-19 C), and μ is the mobility of the charge carriers (40,000 cm²/Vs).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of charge carriers per unit volume (n). We can do this by using the following formula:\n\nn = (ρ * N_A * Purity) / M\n\nwhere ρ is the density of copper (8.96 g/cm³), N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol), Purity is the percentage of copper in the wire (99.99% or 0.9999), and M is the molar mass of copper (63.55 g/mol).\n\nn = (8.96 g/cm³ * 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol * 0.9999) / 63.55 g/mol\nn ≈ 8.49 x 10^22 atoms/cm³\n\nNow we can calculate the conductivity (σ):\n\nσ = n * q * μ\nσ = (8.49 x 10^22 atoms/cm³) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (40,000 cm²/Vs)\nσ ≈ 5.42 x 10^7 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.42 x 10^7 S/m."
