    "message_2": "The maximum mass of a neutron star before it collapses into a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit is not a fixed value, but it is generally believed to be around 2 to 3 solar masses (1 solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg). The exact value of the TOV limit depends on the properties of neutron star matter, such as its equation of state (EOS) and the presence of exotic particles.\n\nThe equation of state (EOS) is a mathematical relationship that describes how the pressure, density, and temperature of a material are related. In the case of neutron stars, the EOS determines how the pressure inside the star increases as its density increases. A stiffer EOS, which corresponds to a higher pressure at a given density, can support a more massive neutron star before collapsing into a black hole. Conversely, a softer EOS, with lower pressure at a given density, results in a lower maximum mass for neutron stars.\n\nThe presence of exotic particles, such as hyperons, quarks, or Bose-Einstein condensates, can also affect the maximum mass of a neutron star. These particles can appear at high densities and can alter the EOS of neutron star matter. Generally, the appearance of exotic particles softens the EOS, leading to a lower maximum mass for neutron stars. However, the exact impact of these particles on the maximum mass depends on their specific properties and interactions with other particles in the neutron star.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of a neutron star before it collapses into a black hole depends on the properties of neutron star matter, such as its equation of state and the presence of exotic particles. A stiffer EOS and the absence of exotic particles can support a more massive neutron star, while a softer EOS and the presence of exotic particles lead to a lower maximum mass. Current observations and theoretical models suggest that the TOV limit is around 2 to 3 solar masses, but ongoing research aims to refine this estimate and better understand the properties of neutron star matter."
