    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nm_rel = m_rest / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_rest is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm_rest = 1.5 x 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.95c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.95c)^2 / c^2 = 0.95^2 = 0.9025\n\nNow, we can find 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975\n\nNext, we find the square root of 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.0975) ≈ 0.312\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = m_rest / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1.5 x 10^-27 kg) / 0.312 ≈ 4.81 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the particle is approximately 4.81 x 10^-27 kg."
