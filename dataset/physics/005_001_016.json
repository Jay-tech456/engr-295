    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by a spaceship traveling at 0.8c relative to Earth, we can use the time dilation formula derived from the theory of special relativity:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nt' is the time experienced by the observer on Earth (the dilated time),\nt is the proper time experienced by the spaceship (5 years in this case),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c),\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the factor inside the square root:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = 5 years / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 5 years / sqrt(0.36)\n\nt' = 5 years / 0.6 = 25/3 years â‰ˆ 8.33 years\n\nSo, during the 5-year mission according to the spaceship's on-board clocks, approximately 8.33 years will have passed on Earth."
