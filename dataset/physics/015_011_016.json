    "message_2": "The expected rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the types of compact objects being observed. The two main types of compact objects that produce detectable gravitational waves are binary systems of neutron stars and black holes.\n\nThe current generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO and Virgo, have already made several detections of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers and one detection from a binary neutron star merger. The detection rate for these observatories is expected to increase as their sensitivity improves and as more detectors come online.\n\nFor future observatories, the expected rate of gravitational wave detections will depend on their design and capabilities. For example, the planned Einstein Telescope is expected to be significantly more sensitive than current detectors, allowing it to detect gravitational waves from a larger volume of the universe. This increased sensitivity could lead to a detection rate of several hundred to thousands of events per year, depending on the true distribution of compact objects in the universe.\n\nAnother future observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, allowing it to detect events such as the mergers of supermassive black holes. The expected detection rate for LISA is less certain, as it depends on the poorly understood population of supermassive black holes, but estimates suggest it could detect tens of events per year.\n\nIn summary, the expected rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories will depend on their sensitivity and the types of compact objects they are designed to observe. With improved sensitivity and new types of detectors, the detection rate could be several orders of magnitude higher than current observatories, potentially reaching hundreds to thousands of events per year. However, these estimates are subject to uncertainties in the distribution and types of compact objects in the universe."
