Specific heat capacity of ice is 2100 J/kg°C, specific heat capacity of water is 4186 J/kg°C, specific heat capacity of steam is 2010 J/kg°C, and latent heat of fusion of ice is 334 kJ/kg and latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 kJ/kg.",
    "message_2": "To find the total amount of heat transferred, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C\n3. Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C\n4. Vaporizing the water at 100°C\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nQ1 = mass * specific heat capacity of ice * temperature change\nQ1 = 2 kg * 2100 J/kg°C * (0 - (-10))°C\nQ1 = 2 * 2100 * 10\nQ1 = 42000 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nQ2 = mass * latent heat of fusion of ice\nQ2 = 2 kg * 334000 J/kg\nQ2 = 668000 J\n\nStep 3: Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C\nQ3 = mass * specific heat capacity of water * temperature change\nQ3 = 2 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * (100 - 0)°C\nQ3 = 2 * 4186 * 100\nQ3 = 836000 J\n\nStep 4: Vaporizing the water at 100°C\nQ4 = mass * latent heat of vaporization of water\nQ4 = 2 kg * 2260000 J/kg\nQ4 = 4520000 J\n\nNow, we can find the total heat transferred by adding the heat from all the steps:\nTotal heat transferred (Q) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4\nQ = 42000 J + 668000 J + 836000 J + 4520000 J\nQ = 5978000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat transferred when a 2 kg block of ice at -10°C is heated until it turns into steam at 100°C is 5,978,000 Joules."
