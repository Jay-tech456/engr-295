    "message_2": "To find the fugacity of water at a temperature of 100°C and a pressure of 1 bar, we can use the steam tables provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The steam tables can be accessed at the following link: https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature and pressure to the units used in the NIST tables. The temperature is already in Celsius, so no conversion is needed. The pressure needs to be converted from bars to MPa. \n\n1 bar = 0.1 MPa\n\nNow, we can look up the properties of water at 100°C and 0.1 MPa in the NIST steam tables. At this temperature and pressure, water is in a saturated state, meaning it is at the boiling point and can exist as both liquid and vapor. \n\nFrom the NIST tables, we find the following properties for saturated water at 100°C and 0.1 MPa:\n\n- Saturated liquid fugacity (f_liq): 0.09963 MPa\n- Saturated vapor fugacity (f_vap): 0.09963 MPa\n\nThe fugacity of water at 100°C and 1 bar (0.1 MPa) is 0.09963 MPa. Note that the fugacity is the same for both the liquid and vapor phases in this case, as it is at the boiling point."
