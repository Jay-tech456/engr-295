    "message_2": "To calculate the force between two protons, we can use Coulomb's Law:\n\nF = (k * q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force between the two charges, k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the two protons, and r is the distance between them.\n\nThe charge of a proton is approximately +1.6 × 10^-19 C. Since we are considering the force between two protons, q1 and q2 will both have this value.\n\nq1 = q2 = +1.6 × 10^-19 C\n\nThe distance between the two protons is given as 4.0 × 10^-15 meters.\n\nr = 4.0 × 10^-15 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into Coulomb's Law:\n\nF = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (1.6 × 10^-19 C) * (1.6 × 10^-19 C) / (4.0 × 10^-15 m)^2\n\nF ≈ (8.99 × 10^9) * (2.56 × 10^-38) / (1.6 × 10^-29)\n\nF ≈ 23.0 N\n\nSo the force between the two protons is approximately 23.0 N."
