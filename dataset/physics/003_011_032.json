    "message_1": "A circular disc of radius 0.1 m carries a steady current of 4 A. Find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the disc, 0.2 m away from its center. Given that the permeability of free space is 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the circular disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and x is the distance from the center of the disc along its axis.\n\nGiven values:\nR = 0.1 m\nI = 4 A\nx = 0.2 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.04 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * 0.125 m³)\n\nB = (16π × 10⁻⁷ T·m²) / (0.25 m³)\n\nB = (64π × 10⁻⁷ T·m²) / (1 m³)\n\nB = 64π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point on the axis of the disc is approximately 64π × 10⁻⁷ T."
