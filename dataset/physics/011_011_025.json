    "message_2": "The direction of an applied force on a piezoelectric crystal affects both the magnitude and direction of the induced electric field. Piezoelectric materials exhibit a unique property where mechanical stress or strain applied to the material results in an electric charge or voltage across the material. This phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect.\n\nThe relationship between the applied force and the induced electric field can be described by the piezoelectric tensor, which is a third-rank tensor that relates the stress or strain applied to the material to the resulting electric field or electric displacement. The piezoelectric tensor has 18 independent components, which means that the response of the material depends on the direction and magnitude of the applied force.\n\nWhen a force is applied along a specific direction, the induced electric field will be generated in a direction that is determined by the piezoelectric tensor. The magnitude of the induced electric field will also depend on the magnitude of the applied force and the piezoelectric coefficients of the material.\n\nExperimental evidence for the direction-dependent behavior of piezoelectric materials can be obtained by measuring the induced electric field or voltage as a function of the applied force direction. One common experimental setup involves using a uniaxial or multiaxial testing machine to apply controlled forces to a piezoelectric sample while measuring the resulting electric field or voltage with appropriate instrumentation.\n\nFor example, a study by Zhang et al. (2012) investigated the piezoelectric properties of potassium sodium niobate (KNN) single crystals under various loading directions. They found that the piezoelectric response of the material was highly dependent on the direction of the applied force, with the maximum response observed when the force was applied along the crystallographic c-axis.\n\nIn conclusion, the direction of an applied force on a piezoelectric crystal affects both the magnitude and direction of the induced electric field due to the anisotropic nature of the piezoelectric effect. Experimental evidence supporting this behavior can be obtained by measuring the induced electric field or voltage as a function of the applied force direction in controlled experiments.\n\nReference:\n\nZhang, S., Li, J., Zhang, B., Yao, F., & Wang, Q.
