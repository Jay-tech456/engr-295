    "message_1": "A wire with a resistance of 8 ohms is carrying a current of 4 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a distance of 3 cm from the wire? (Assume that the wire is infinitely long and straight)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field produced by a long straight wire carrying a current, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nI = 4 A (current)\nr = 3 cm = 0.03 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m * 4 A) / (2 * 0.03 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (16 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.06 m)\nB = (16 × 10^(-7)) / (0.06) T\nB = 2.67 × 10^(-6) T\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a distance of 3 cm from the wire is approximately 2.67 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
