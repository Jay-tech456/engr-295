    "message_2": "The angular momentum of a rotating black hole can be described using the Kerr metric, which is a solution to the Einstein field equations of general relativity. The angular momentum (J) of a rotating black hole is related to its mass (M) and its dimensionless spin parameter (a*), which ranges from 0 (non-rotating) to 1 (maximally rotating).\n\nThe formula for the angular momentum of a rotating black hole is:\n\nJ = a* * G * M^2 / c\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), c is the speed of light (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s), and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the black hole in kilograms is:\n\nM = 10 solar masses * (1.989 × 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the dimensionless spin parameter (a*) using the given angular velocity (ω). The relationship between a* and ω for a Kerr black hole is:\n\na* = (2 * ω * G * M) / c^3\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na* = (2 * 0.5 rad/s * 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^31 kg) / (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)^3\n\na* ≈ 0.021\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular momentum (J) using the formula:\n\nJ = a* * G * M^2 / c\n\nJ = 0.021 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^31 kg)^2 / (2.99792 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nJ ≈ 1.77 × 10^40 kg m^2/s\n\nTherefore, the angular momentum of the rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses and an angular velocity of 0.5 radians per second is approximately 1.77 × 10^40 kg m^2/s, according to the Kerr metric."
