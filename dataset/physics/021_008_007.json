    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by the merging of two black holes, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency: The frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c) and the time to coalescence (t_c) as follows:\n\nf = (5/8π) * (M_c / t_c)^(3/8)\n\nwhere M_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5), with m1 and m2 being the masses of the two black holes in solar masses.\n\n2. Amplitude: The amplitude of gravitational waves can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c) and the luminosity distance (D_L) as follows:\n\nh = (4/G) * (M_c / D_L) * (π * f * G * M_c)^(2/3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, and D_L is the luminosity distance in meters.\n\nGiven the masses of the black holes (m1 = 30 solar masses and m2 = 40 solar masses) and the distance (1.3 billion light years), we can calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves:\n\n1. Chirp mass (M_c):\n\nM_c = (30 * 40)^(3/5) / (30 + 40)^(1/5) ≈ 34.5 solar masses\n\n2. Time to coalescence (t_c):\n\nWe can estimate the time to coalescence using the chirp mass and the frequency:\n\nt_c ≈ 5 * G * M_c / (256 * π * f^8)\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact frequency, we cannot calculate t_c. Instead, we can use the fact that the frequency increases during the inspiral phase, and the peak frequency occurs at the moment of coalescence. For black holes with masses of 30 and 40 solar masses, the peak frequency is expected to be around 150-250 Hz.\n\n3. Luminosity distance (D_L):\n\n1.3 billion light years = 1.3 * 10^9 * 9.461 * 10^15 meters ≈ 1.23 * 10^25 meters\n\n4. Frequency (f):\n\nUsing the peak frequency range of 150-250 Hz, we can estimate the frequency of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase to be within this range.\n\n5. Amplitude (h):\n\nUsing the chirp mass, luminosity distance, and the frequency range, we can estimate the amplitude of the gravitational waves:\n\nh ≈ (4/G) * (34.5 / 1.23 * 10^25) * (π * 150-250 * G * 34.5)^(2/3)\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves is expected to be on the order of 10^-21 to 10^-22.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the merging of two black holes with masses of 30 and 40 solar masses is within the range of 150-250 Hz, and the amplitude is on the order of 10^-21 to 10^-22."
