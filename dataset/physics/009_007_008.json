    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 3*di + 2*di\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\n60 = 5*di\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is 12 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (m), we can use the formula:\n\nm = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = -12/30\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nm = -2/5\n\nThe magnification of the image is -2/5, which means the image is inverted (due to the negative sign) and reduced in size (since the magnitude is less than 1)."
