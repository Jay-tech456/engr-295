    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total mass-energy density. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it extremely difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies.\n\nIn the Milky Way galaxy, dark matter is believed to be distributed in a roughly spherical halo that extends beyond the visible disk of the galaxy. The distribution of dark matter is not uniform, and its density decreases as we move away from the galactic center. The density profile of dark matter in the Milky Way is often described by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile or an Einasto profile, both of which are empirical models based on numerical simulations of dark matter halo formation.\n\nThe NFW profile is given by the equation:\n\nρ(r) = ρ_s / [(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)^2]\n\nwhere ρ(r) is the dark matter density at a distance r from the galactic center, ρ_s is a characteristic density, and r_s is a scale radius.\n\nThe Einasto profile is given by the equation:\n\nρ(r) = ρ_s exp[-(2/α)((r/r_s)^(α) - 1)]\n\nwhere α is a shape parameter that determines the steepness of the density profile.\n\nThe distribution of visible matter in the Milky Way is quite different from that of dark matter. Visible matter is primarily concentrated in the galactic disk, which contains stars, gas, and dust. The disk has a flattened, spiral structure with a central bulge, and its density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the galactic center.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way is roughly spherical and extends beyond the visible disk, while visible matter is concentrated in a flattened, spiral disk. The presence of dark matter has significant effects on the dynamics of the galaxy, such as the rotation curve of stars and gas, which remains flat or slowly declining at large distances from the center, indicating the presence of a massive, unseen component – the dark matter halo."
