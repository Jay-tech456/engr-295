    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. However, we first need to find the focal length using the radius of curvature (R) of the mirror:\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we know the object distance (do) is 30 cm. We can use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di):\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(3 - 1)/30 = 1/di\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find di by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the concave mirror is 10 cm, and the image distance is 15 cm."
