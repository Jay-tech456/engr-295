    "message_2": "The maximum distance at which a binary black hole merger can be detected by LIGO depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the masses of the black holes, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold for detection.\n\nLIGO's sensitivity has improved over time, with the current third observing run (O3) having a higher sensitivity than previous runs. At its current sensitivity, LIGO can detect binary black hole mergers with total masses up to around 100 solar masses at a distance of about 1 Gpc (gigaparsec), which is approximately 3.26 billion light-years away. This is a rough estimate, as the actual detection range can vary depending on the specific properties of the merging black holes and the orientation of their orbits relative to Earth.\n\nIt is important to note that the detection range for gravitational waves will continue to improve as LIGO and other detectors are upgraded and as new detectors, such as the upcoming LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission, come online."
