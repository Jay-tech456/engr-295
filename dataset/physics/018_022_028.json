    "message_2": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a theoretical framework that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. In the context of B meson decays, the radiative decay B -> K*γ (where B is a B meson, K* is a K* meson, and γ is a photon) is an important process to study, as it can provide insights into the underlying physics and potential deviations from the SM.\n\nThe branching ratio of the B -> K*γ decay is a measure of the probability of this decay mode occurring relative to all possible decay modes of the B meson. In the SM, the branching ratio for this process is predicted to be around (4.0 ± 0.2) × 10^(-5) (i.e., about 4 in 100,000 B meson decays will result in the B -> K*γ decay).\n\nExperimental measurements of the branching ratio have been performed by various collaborations, such as the BaBar, Belle, CLEO, and LHCb experiments. The current world average for the branching ratio of B -> K*γ, which combines the results from these experiments, is (3.9 ± 0.2) × 10^(-5). This value is in good agreement with the SM prediction, indicating that the experimental data is consistent with the theoretical expectations.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the branching ratio measurement agrees well with the SM prediction, there are other observables in B -> K*γ decays, such as angular distributions and CP asymmetries, that show some tension with the SM predictions. These discrepancies could potentially hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model, and further experimental and theoretical investigations are ongoing to better understand these effects."
