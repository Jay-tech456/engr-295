    "message_2": "As a physicist, I can tell you that black holes themselves are not candidates for dark matter particles. However, there is a hypothetical type of black hole called a \"primordial black hole\" that could potentially be a candidate for dark matter. Primordial black holes are different from the black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars. They are thought to have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations.\n\nThe minimum mass for a primordial black hole to be a candidate for dark matter is not well-defined, as it depends on various factors such as the age of the universe, the density of dark matter, and the constraints from observations. However, some studies suggest that primordial black holes with masses in the range of 10^(-8) to 10^(-2) solar masses could be potential dark matter candidates.\n\nIt is important to note that the existence of primordial black holes as dark matter candidates is still a matter of ongoing research and debate among physicists. There are other more widely accepted candidates for dark matter particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions."
