    "message_2": "In a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, the minimum number of qubits required for secure communication is typically two. This is because QKD relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to create and share a secret key between two parties, usually referred to as Alice and Bob.\n\nThe most well-known QKD protocol is the BB84 protocol, which uses two non-orthogonal qubit bases for encoding and decoding the key. In this protocol, Alice randomly selects a qubit basis (either rectilinear or diagonal) and sends a qubit to Bob. Bob also randomly chooses a basis to measure the qubit. They then compare their chosen bases, and if they match, the bit value is added to their shared secret key. This process is repeated until they have a sufficiently long key.\n\nIn classical cryptography, secure key distribution relies on mathematical algorithms and computational complexity to protect the key. For example, in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, two parties can generate a shared secret key using modular arithmetic and large prime numbers. The security of this protocol relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.\n\nThe main difference between quantum and classical key distribution is the level of security. QKD provides unconditional security, meaning that it is secure against any eavesdropping attempts, even by an attacker with unlimited computational power. This is due to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem and the fact that measuring a quantum state disturbs it. In contrast, classical key distribution protocols are only computationally secure, meaning that their security relies on the assumption that certain mathematical problems are difficult to solve. If an attacker had enough computational power or found an efficient algorithm to solve these problems, classical key distribution protocols could be broken."
