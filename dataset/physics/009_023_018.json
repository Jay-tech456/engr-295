    "message_2": "Malus' law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizing filters is given by the formula:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle θ that reduces the intensity by 50%, so:\n\n0.5 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I₀:\n\n0.5 = cos²(θ)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.7071\n\nTo find the angle θ, we take the inverse cosine (cos⁻¹) of 0.7071:\n\nθ ≈ cos⁻¹(0.7071) ≈ 45°\n\nSo, the angle between the two polarizing filters needed to reduce the intensity of polarized light by 50% is approximately 45 degrees."
