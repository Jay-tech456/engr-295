    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 is the reference vapor pressure (we can use the vapor pressure of water at 100°C, which is 1 atm)\nP2 is the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (which we want to find)\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol)\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT1 is the reference temperature (373.15 K, which is 100°C in Kelvin)\nT2 is the temperature at which we want to find the vapor pressure (298.15 K, which is 25°C in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the heat of vaporization to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/1 atm) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2) = 5.083\nP2 = e^5.083 ≈ 161.4\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 161.4 times lower than at 100°C. Since the vapor pressure at 100°C is 1 atm, the vapor pressure at 25°C is:\n\nP2 = 1 atm / 161.4 ≈ 0.0062 atm\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 0.0062 atm."
