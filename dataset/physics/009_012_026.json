    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification of the image, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nFor a concave lens, the focal length is negative, so f = -20 cm. The object distance is u = 30 cm.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/30\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-30 = 30v - 20v\n\nNow combine the terms:\n\n-10v = -30\n\nDivide both sides by -10:\n\nv = 3 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is 3 cm in front of the lens.\n\nNow we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -3/30\n\nM = -1/10\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1/10, which means the image is 1/10th the size of the object and is inverted (due to the negative sign)."
