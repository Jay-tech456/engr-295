    "message_2": "The current understanding of the amount and distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe is based on various observations and measurements, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy clustering, and gravitational lensing. According to the latest data from the Planck satellite, the composition of the universe is approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark matter is believed to be distributed in a \"cosmic web\" structure, with galaxy clusters and filaments connected by vast amounts of dark matter. This distribution plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, as dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for the visible matter to clump together and form these structures.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but the leading hypothesis is that it is related to the cosmological constant, a term in Einstein's theory of general relativity that represents the energy density of the vacuum of space.\n\nThe presence of dark energy affects the overall structure and evolution of the cosmos in several ways. First, it counteracts the gravitational attraction of matter, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. This accelerated expansion leads to a more diffuse distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters over time, as they are pushed farther apart by the expansion. Additionally, the accelerated expansion affects the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, as it limits the growth of galaxy clusters and filaments by reducing the amount of time available for gravitational interactions to occur.\n\nIn summary, the current understanding of the amount and distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe suggests that they play crucial roles in shaping the overall structure and evolution of the cosmos. Dark matter provides the gravitational framework for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, influencing the distribution and growth of large-scale structures. However, many questions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy remain unanswered, and further research is needed to fully understand their properties and implications for the universe."
