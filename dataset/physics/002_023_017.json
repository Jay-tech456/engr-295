    "message_1": "A sealed container is filled with a liquid substance at a temperature of 30°C. The substance has a vapor pressure of 40 mmHg at this temperature. The container is then heated to 70°C. Calculate the new vapor pressure of the substance inside the container.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the new vapor pressure of the substance inside the container, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the initial and final vapor pressures, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 30°C + 273.15 = 303.15 K\nT2 = 70°C + 273.15 = 343.15 K\n\nWe don't have the value of ΔHvap for the substance, so we cannot directly calculate the new vapor pressure. However, we can provide a general solution in terms of ΔHvap:\n\nln(P2/40) = (ΔHvap/8.314) * (1/303.15 - 1/343.15)\n\nTo solve for P2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nP2 = 40 * exp((ΔHvap/8.314) * (1/303.15 - 1/343.15))\n\nWithout knowing the value of ΔHvap, we cannot provide a numerical value for the new vapor pressure. However, this equation can be used to calculate P2 once ΔHvap is known."
