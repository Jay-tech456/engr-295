    "message_2": "The expected energy spectrum of cosmic rays resulting from dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way galaxy depends on the specific dark matter candidate and the annihilation channels. One of the leading dark matter candidates is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). When WIMPs annihilate, they produce various Standard Model particles, including quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons, which eventually decay into stable particles such as photons, neutrinos, and charged cosmic rays (protons, electrons, and their antiparticles).\n\nThe energy spectrum of these cosmic rays depends on the mass of the dark matter particle and the annihilation channel. In general, the spectrum can be described by a power-law function with an exponential cutoff at the mass of the dark matter particle:\n\ndN/dE ∝ (E/E0)^(-γ) * exp(-E/Emax)\n\nwhere dN/dE is the differential number of cosmic rays per unit energy, E is the energy of the cosmic rays, E0 is a reference energy, γ is the spectral index, and Emax is the maximum energy, which is roughly equal to the mass of the dark matter particle.\n\nThe spectral index γ depends on the specific annihilation channel. For example, for annihilation into quarks, γ is typically around 1.5-2.0, while for annihilation into leptons, γ can be as low as 1.0-1.5. The exact values of γ and Emax depend on the details of the dark matter model and the particle physics involved in the annihilation process.\n\nIn summary, the expected energy spectrum of cosmic rays resulting from dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way galaxy is a power-law function with an exponential cutoff, with the spectral index and maximum energy depending on the specific dark matter candidate and annihilation channel."
