    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft flies at Mach 2.5 and generates a shock wave with a deflection angle of 25 degrees. Calculate the maximum pressure ratio across the shock wave if the aircraft's flow properties ahead of the shock wave are known.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum pressure ratio across the shock wave, we can use the oblique shock relations. First, we need to find the Mach angle (μ) and the wave angle (β) using the given Mach number (M) and deflection angle (θ).\n\n1. Mach angle (μ):\nμ = arcsin(1/M)\nμ = arcsin(1/2.5)\nμ ≈ 24.09 degrees\n\n2. To find the wave angle (β), we can use the Prandtl-Meyer function and the Newtonian approximation for the oblique shock angle:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ 2 * cot(β) * [(M^2 * sin^2(β) - 1) / (M^2 * (γ + cos(2β)) + 2)]\n\nwhere γ is the ratio of specific heats, which is approximately 1.4 for air.\n\nSolving for β using the given deflection angle (θ = 25 degrees) and Mach number (M = 2.5):\n\ntan(25) ≈ 2 * cot(β) * [(2.5^2 * sin^2(β) - 1) / (2.5^2 * (1.4 + cos(2β)) + 2)]\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we find that β ≈ 43.48 degrees.\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the pressure ratio (P2/P1) using the oblique shock relations:\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * γ / (γ + 1)) * (M^2 * sin^2(β) - 1)\n\nP2/P1 = 1 + (2 * 1.4 / (1.4 + 1)) * (2.5^2 * sin^2(43.48) - 1)\n\nP2/P1 ≈ 4.50\n\nSo, the maximum pressure ratio across the shock wave is approximately 4.50."
