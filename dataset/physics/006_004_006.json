    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of energy levels in an atom due to the presence of an external electric field. For the hydrogen atom, the first-order Stark effect can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = 3/4 * e * a₀ * F\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy splitting, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), a₀ is the Bohr radius (5.29 x 10^(-11) m), and F is the electric field strength.\n\nGiven the electric field strength F = 6.0 x 10^5 V/m, we can calculate the energy splitting:\n\nΔE = (3/4) * (1.6 x 10^(-19) C) * (5.29 x 10^(-11) m) * (6.0 x 10^5 V/m)\n\nΔE = 0.75 * (1.6 x 10^(-19) C) * (5.29 x 10^(-11) m) * (6.0 x 10^5 V/m)\n\nΔE ≈ 3.77 x 10^(-18) J\n\nThe energy splitting caused by the Stark effect in a hydrogen atom when placed in an electric field of 6.0 x 10^5 V/m is approximately 3.77 x 10^(-18) J."
