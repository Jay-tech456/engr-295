    "message_2": "To optimize plasma-based food processing technology while minimizing damage to nutritional value, texture, and taste, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. Plasma type: Non-thermal (cold) plasma is more suitable for food processing as it operates at lower temperatures, reducing the risk of thermal damage to the food. Non-thermal plasma can be generated using various methods, such as dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), and corona discharge.\n\n2. Plasma treatment time: The duration of plasma exposure should be carefully controlled to ensure complete sterilization without causing significant damage to the food's quality. Shorter treatment times with higher plasma power may be more effective in achieving this balance.\n\n3. Gas composition: The choice of gas used to generate plasma plays a crucial role in the interaction with food components. Gases such as helium, argon, and nitrogen are less reactive and can minimize damage to the food. However, the addition of small amounts of reactive gases like oxygen or air can enhance the sterilization process.\n\n4. Distance between plasma source and food: The distance between the plasma source and the food product should be optimized to ensure uniform treatment and avoid localized overheating or overexposure.\n\nThe underlying physics principles governing plasma interactions with biologically-relevant molecules in food are:\n\n1. Reactive species generation: Plasma generates reactive species, such as ions, electrons, and free radicals, which can interact with the molecules present in food. These reactive species can cause oxidation, reduction, or other chemical reactions, leading to the inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes responsible for spoilage.\n\n2. Electromagnetic field effects: The electric and magnetic fields generated by plasma can cause structural changes in biomolecules, such as proteins and lipids, leading to changes in their functionality and properties.\n\n3. UV radiation: Plasma can emit UV radiation, which can cause damage to the DNA of microorganisms, leading to their inactivation.\n\nTo optimize plasma-based food processing technology, a combination of these factors should be considered and tailored to the specific food product being treated. This may involve adjusting plasma parameters, such as power, gas composition, and treatment time, to achieve the desired balance between sterilization and preservation of food quality. Additionally, further research and development in this field can lead to the discovery of new techniques and approaches to improve the efficiency and safety of plasma-based food processing."
