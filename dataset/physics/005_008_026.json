    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.6c relative to the Earth. An observer on the Earth sees the spaceship pass by, and notes that the spaceship is 100 meters long. However, a passenger on the spaceship measures the length of the spaceship to be only 60 meters long. Calculate the time dilation factor experienced by the passenger, and determine how much time has passed on the spaceship when 1 hour has passed on Earth.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor, we can use the Lorentz factor formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor (time dilation factor), v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ = 1.25\n\nThe time dilation factor experienced by the passenger is 1.25.\n\nNow, to determine how much time has passed on the spaceship when 1 hour has passed on Earth, we can use the following formula:\n\nt' = t / γ\n\nwhere t' is the time experienced by the passenger on the spaceship, t is the time experienced on Earth (1 hour), and γ is the time dilation factor (1.25).\n\nt' = 1 hour / 1.25\nt' = 0.8 hours\n\nSo, when 1 hour has passed on Earth, 0.8 hours (48 minutes) have passed on the spaceship."
