    "message_2": "To find the minimum frequency of incident light required to cause the photoelectric effect, we can use the equation:\n\nWork function (Φ) = h * f_min\n\nwhere Φ is the work function (2.3 eV), h is the Planck's constant (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s), and f_min is the minimum frequency.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for f_min, we get:\n\nf_min = Φ / h\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nf_min = 2.3 eV / (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s)\nf_min ≈ 5.56 × 10^14 Hz\n\nThe minimum frequency of incident light required to cause the photoelectric effect on a potassium atom is approximately 5.56 × 10^14 Hz.\n\nNow, let's calculate the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron when the incident frequency is twice the minimum frequency. We can use the equation:\n\nKE = h * (f - f_min)\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, f is the incident frequency (2 * f_min), and f_min is the minimum frequency.\n\nFirst, let's find the incident frequency:\n\nf = 2 * f_min\nf ≈ 2 * 5.56 × 10^14 Hz\nf ≈ 1.112 × 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nKE = (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s) * (1.112 × 10^15 Hz - 5.56 × 10^14 Hz)\nKE ≈ 2.3 eV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron when the incident frequency is twice the minimum frequency is approximately 2.3 eV."
