    "message_1": "A physics student is given an unpolarized light of intensity 20 W/m² that passes through a polarizer with an angle of 45°. If a second polarizer with an angle of 30° is placed in front of the first polarizer, what will be the intensity of the transmitted light? According to Malus' Law, what percentage of the original light is transmitted through the two polarizers?",
    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by half. So after passing through the first polarizer (30°), the intensity becomes:\n\nI1 = (1/2) * 20 W/m² = 10 W/m²\n\nNow, the light is polarized and passes through the second polarizer (45°). The angle between the two polarizers is:\n\nΔθ = 45° - 30° = 15°\n\nAccording to Malus' Law, the intensity of the transmitted light through the second polarizer is given by:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos²(Δθ)\n\nI2 = 10 W/m² * cos²(15°)\n\nI2 ≈ 10 W/m² * 0.9659\n\nI2 ≈ 9.659 W/m²\n\nThe intensity of the transmitted light through both polarizers is approximately 9.659 W/m².\n\nTo find the percentage of the original light transmitted through the two polarizers, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (I2 / I0) * 100\n\nPercentage = (9.659 W/m² / 20 W/m²) * 100\n\nPercentage ≈ 48.3%\n\nSo, approximately 48.3% of the original light is transmitted through the two polarizers."
