    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section (σ) for a given target atom can be calculated using the Mott formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (4 * E * sin²(θ/2)))² * (1 / (1 + (2 * E * sin²(θ/2) / m_e * c²)))\n\nwhere:\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the projectile and target atoms, respectively\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- E is the energy of the projectile in MeV\n- θ is the scattering angle\n- m_e is the mass of the electron (0.511 MeV/c²)\n- c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nFor He atoms (Z = 2) and an energy of 100 MeV, we can calculate the Mott scattering cross section at an angle of 30 degrees:\n\nZ₁ = Z₂ = 2\nE = 100 MeV\nθ = 30 degrees\n\nFirst, convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ_rad = 30 * (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, calculate the Mott scattering cross section:\n\nσ(θ) = (2 * 2 * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2 / (4 * 100 * sin²(π / 12)))² * (1 / (1 + (2 * 100 * sin²(π / 12) / (0.511 * (3 x 10^8)^2))))\n\nσ(θ) ≈ 1.44 x 10^(-30) m²\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for He atoms at an energy of 100 MeV and an angle of 30 degrees is approximately 1.44 x 10^(-30) m²."
