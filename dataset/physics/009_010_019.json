    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 20 cm) and the object distance (do = 10 cm). We can now solve for the image distance (di):\n\n1/20 = 1/10 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first subtract 1/10 from both sides:\n\n1/20 - 1/10 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/20 - 2/20 = 1/di\n\n-1/20 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = -20 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -(-20 cm) / (10 cm)\n\nM = 20/10\n\nM = 2\n\nThe magnification produced by the mirror is 2, which means the image is twice the size of the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the concave mirror produces a magnification of 2, and the image formed is virtual."
