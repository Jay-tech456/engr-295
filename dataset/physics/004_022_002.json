    "message_2": "The expected amplitude and frequency range for the gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of binary neutron stars depend on several factors, such as the masses of the neutron stars, their distance from the observer, and the specifics of their orbital dynamics. However, we can provide a general idea of the expected values.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude of gravitational waves is typically expressed in terms of the dimensionless strain, h, which represents the fractional change in the distance between two points due to the passing gravitational wave. The amplitude of the strain is given by:\n\nh ~ (4 * G * M * ω^2 * R) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system, ω is the angular frequency of the orbit, R is the separation between the neutron stars, c is the speed of light, and D is the distance from the observer to the binary system.\n\nFor binary neutron stars, the amplitude of the strain is typically on the order of 10^(-22) to 10^(-21) at a distance of about 100 Mpc (megaparsecs) from Earth.\n\nFrequency range: The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. As the neutron stars spiral inwards and merge, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves increases. The frequency range for binary neutron star coalescence is typically between 10 Hz and a few kHz. The lower frequency range corresponds to the early inspiral phase, while the higher frequencies are associated with the late inspiral and merger phases.\n\nComparison with General Relativity: The amplitude and frequency range of gravitational waves produced by binary neutron star coalescence, as described above, are based on the predictions of General Relativity. The first direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger (GW170817) by the LIGO and Virgo observatories in 2017 provided strong support for these predictions. The observed amplitude and frequency range were consistent with the expectations from General Relativity, further confirming the validity of the theory in describing the behavior of gravitational waves and compact binary systems."
