    "message_1": "A laser beam of wavelength 633nm is shone through a double slit, creating an interference pattern on a screen 1.5m away. The distance between the slits is 0.25mm and the distance between adjacent bright fringes on the screen is 4.0mm. Calculate the distance between the center of the central bright fringe and the 5th-order bright fringe.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the center of the central bright fringe and the 5th-order bright fringe, we can use the formula for the position of bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\ny_n = (n * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y_n is the distance from the central bright fringe to the nth-order bright fringe, n is the order of the fringe, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nGiven:\nλ = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\nL = 1.5 m\nd = 0.25 mm = 0.25 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\nn = 5 (for the 5th-order bright fringe)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ny_5 = (5 * 633 * 10^(-9) * 1.5) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\ny_5 = (5 * 633 * 10^(-9) * 1.5) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\ny_5 ≈ 0.019 m\n\nSo, the distance between the center of the central bright fringe and the 5th-order bright fringe is approximately 0.019 meters or 19 millimeters."
