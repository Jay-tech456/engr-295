    "message_2": "High-energy gamma rays are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, with photon energies exceeding 100 keV (kilo-electron volts). They are produced by various astrophysical processes and objects in the universe. The major sources of high-energy gamma rays include:\n\n1. Supernovae: When massive stars reach the end of their lives, they explode in a supernova, releasing vast amounts of energy, including high-energy gamma rays. These gamma rays can travel across vast distances in space and reach Earth.\n\n2. Pulsars: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, including gamma rays. As the pulsar rotates, the beam sweeps across the sky, and if it intersects with Earth, we can detect the gamma rays.\n\n3. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): AGNs are extremely bright and energetic sources powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. As matter falls into the black hole, it forms an accretion disk, which emits gamma rays due to the extreme temperatures and magnetic fields.\n\n4. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): GRBs are the most energetic explosions in the universe, releasing more energy in a few seconds than the Sun will emit in its entire lifetime. They are thought to be caused by the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. The gamma rays from these events can travel across the universe and reach Earth.\n\n5. Cosmic Ray Interactions: High-energy cosmic rays, which are charged particles traveling through space at nearly the speed of light, can interact with interstellar gas and radiation fields, producing gamma rays in the process. These gamma rays can then propagate through space and reach Earth.\n\nGamma rays travel through space at the speed of light, and their journey to Earth is mostly unimpeded by interstellar matter. However, they can be absorbed or scattered by the interstellar medium or the Earth's atmosphere. When gamma rays reach Earth, they can be detected by specialized telescopes, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which observes the high-energy gamma-ray sky and helps us understand the nature of these extreme astrophysical phenomena."
