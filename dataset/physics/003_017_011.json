    "message_1": "A square loop of side length 20 cm carries a current of 5 A. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located on the perpendicular bisector of one of the sides of the square loop, at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has a side length of 20 cm (0.2 m), we can divide each side into small segments (dl) and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment, then sum up the contributions from all segments.\n\nLet's consider the point P located on the perpendicular bisector of one of the sides of the square loop, at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center of the loop. We can use symmetry to our advantage and only calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the square, then multiply the result by 4.\n\nLet's consider the side of the square closest to point P. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along this side to find the magnetic field due to this side:\n\nB_side = ∫dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the current is flowing in the same direction along this side, the magnetic field will be in the same direction for all segments, so we can integrate the magnitudes directly:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dl * sinθ) / r³\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r. For each segment, sinθ = (0.1 m) / r, and r = sqrt((0.1 m)² + x²), where x is the distance from the center of the side to the segment.\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dl * 0.1) / (0.1² + x²)^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating from x = -0.1 m to x = 0.1 m:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * 0.1 * [arctan(x / 0.1)] from -0.1 to 0.1\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * 5 A * 0.1 * [arctan(0.1 / 0.1) - arctan(-0.1 / 0.1)]\n\nB_side = (10^(-7) T) * 5 * 0.1 * [arctan(1) - arctan(-1)]\n\nB_side = 5 × 10^(-8) T * [π/4 - (-π/4)]\n\nB_side = 5 × 10^(-8) T * (π/2)\n\nNow, we can multiply this result by 4 to account for the contributions from all four sides of the square loop:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * 5 × 10^(-8) T * (π/2)\n\nB_total = 10 × 10^(-7) T * π\n\nB_total = π × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point is approximately π × 10^(-6) T."
