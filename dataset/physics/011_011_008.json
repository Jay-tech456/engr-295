    "message_2": "The piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon where certain materials, such as quartz crystals, generate an electric polarization when subjected to mechanical stress. The relationship between the direction of the applied stress and the resulting electric polarization can be described mathematically using the piezoelectric tensor.\n\nThe piezoelectric tensor, denoted as d, is a third-rank tensor that relates the applied stress (σ) to the resulting electric polarization (P). The relationship can be written as:\n\nP_i = d_ijk * σ_jk\n\nHere, i, j, and k are indices that represent the three spatial dimensions (x, y, and z). The piezoelectric tensor has 27 components (3x3x3), but due to the symmetry of the stress tensor and the crystal structure, only a few of these components are non-zero for a given crystal.\n\nFor a quartz crystal, which belongs to the trigonal crystal system, the non-zero components of the piezoelectric tensor are d_11, d_12, d_13, d_14, d_15, and d_33. The relationship between the applied stress and the electric polarization can be written as:\n\nP_x = d_11 * σ_x + d_12 * σ_y + d_13 * σ_z\nP_y = d_12 * σ_x + d_11 * σ_y + d_13 * σ_z\nP_z = d_13 * σ_x + d_13 * σ_y + d_33 * σ_z\n\nThe physical reasoning behind this relationship is that when a mechanical stress is applied to a piezoelectric material, it causes a displacement of the positive and negative charges within the crystal lattice. This displacement results in an electric polarization, which is proportional to the applied stress. The piezoelectric tensor describes how the applied stress in each direction contributes to the electric polarization in each direction.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the direction of an applied stress and the resulting electric polarization in a quartz crystal exhibiting the piezoelectric effect can be described mathematically using the piezoelectric tensor. The non-zero components of the tensor for a quartz crystal relate the applied stress in each direction to the electric polarization in each direction. The piezoelectric effect arises from the displacement of charges within the crystal lattice due to the applied stress."
