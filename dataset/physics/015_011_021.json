    "message_2": "The number of gravitational wave detections expected from future observatories like LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) and the Einstein Telescope depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the observation time, and the population of gravitational wave sources in the universe.\n\nLISA is a space-based gravitational wave observatory that is expected to be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves (10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz) compared to ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo. This allows LISA to detect sources such as supermassive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and galactic binaries. Based on current estimates, LISA is expected to detect a few tens of supermassive black hole mergers per year and thousands of galactic binaries over its mission lifetime of 4 years.\n\nThe Einstein Telescope is a proposed third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector that aims to be 10 to 100 times more sensitive than current detectors like LIGO and Virgo. This increased sensitivity will enable the Einstein Telescope to detect a larger number of sources, such as binary neutron star mergers, neutron star-black hole mergers, and binary black hole mergers. Based on current estimates, the Einstein Telescope could detect up to several thousand binary neutron star mergers per year, several hundred neutron star-black hole mergers per year, and tens of thousands of binary black hole mergers per year.\n\nIt is important to note that these estimates are based on current knowledge of gravitational wave sources in the universe and could change as our understanding of these sources improves. Additionally, the actual number of detections will depend on the final design and sensitivity of the observatories, as well as the duration of their observation periods."
