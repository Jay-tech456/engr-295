    "message_2": "The mechanical properties of a lipid bilayer, such as bending modulus and tension, are influenced by the mechanical stress applied to it. The relationship between mechanical stress and these properties can be described as follows:\n\n1. Bending modulus (κ): Bending modulus is a measure of the bilayer's resistance to bending. When mechanical stress is applied to a lipid bilayer, it can cause the bilayer to bend or deform. The relationship between the applied stress and the resulting curvature of the bilayer is governed by the Helfrich energy model, which states that the bending energy (U) is proportional to the bending modulus (κ) and the square of the mean curvature (H) of the bilayer:\n\n   U = κ ∫(H^2 - C₀^2) dA\n\n   where C₀ is the spontaneous curvature and dA is the differential area element.\n\n2. Tension (σ): Tension is a measure of the force acting on the bilayer per unit length. When mechanical stress is applied to a lipid bilayer, it can cause the bilayer to stretch or compress. The relationship between the applied stress and the resulting change in the bilayer's area can be described by the area expansion modulus (K_A):\n\n   σ = K_A * (ΔA/A₀)\n\n   where ΔA is the change in the bilayer's area and A₀ is the initial area of the bilayer.\n\nIn summary, the mechanical stress applied to a lipid bilayer can affect its mechanical properties, such as bending modulus and tension, by causing changes in the bilayer's curvature and area. The relationship between the applied stress and these properties can be described by the Helfrich energy model and the area expansion modulus, respectively."
