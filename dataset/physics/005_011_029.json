    "message_2": "To find the total mass of the spaceship when it is traveling at 0.8c, we can use the formula for relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the factor by which the mass increases due to the relativistic effect. Since the mass increase is 60%, the factor is 1 + 0.6 = 1.6.\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 * 1.6\nm = 1000 kg * 1.6\nm = 1600 kg\n\nSo, the total mass of the spaceship when it is traveling at a velocity of 0.8c is 1600 kg."
