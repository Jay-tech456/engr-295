    "message_1": "According to special relativity, if one twin travels on a high-speed spaceship and the other twin stays on Earth, how much younger will the twin on the spaceship be upon their return to Earth after 10 years of traveling at 90% of the speed of light, compared to the twin who stayed on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the time dilation formula from special relativity:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\n- Δt' is the time experienced by the twin on the spaceship (proper time)\n- Δt is the time experienced by the twin on Earth (coordinate time)\n- v is the velocity of the spaceship (90% of the speed of light)\n- c is the speed of light\n\nFirst, let's convert 90% of the speed of light to a decimal: 0.9c.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔt' = 10 years / √(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = 10 years / √(1 - 0.81)\n\nΔt' = 10 years / √(0.19)\n\nΔt' ≈ 10 years / 0.4359\n\nΔt' ≈ 22.94 years\n\nThe twin on the spaceship will have experienced about 22.94 years of time during their 10-year journey at 90% of the speed of light. Therefore, the twin on the spaceship will be approximately 22.94 - 10 = 12.94 years younger than the twin who stayed on Earth."
