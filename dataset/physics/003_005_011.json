    "message_1": "A straight wire of length 0.5 meters carries a current of 2.5 A. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 meters from the wire.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance from a straight wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nI = 2.5 A\nr = 0.8 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.8 m)\n\nB = (10^(-7) * 10 T·m) / 0.8 m\n\nB = 1.25 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 meters from the wire is 1.25 × 10^(-6) T (tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have any specific orientation of the wire, we can only say that the magnetic field will be circular around the wire, with the direction determined by the right-hand rule."
