    "message_2": "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth's atmosphere can be described by a power-law function, which represents the differential flux of cosmic rays as a function of their energy. The power-law function can be written as:\n\ndN/dE = k * (E)^(-γ)\n\nwhere dN/dE is the differential flux (number of particles per unit area, per unit time, and per unit energy), E is the energy of the cosmic rays, k is a normalization constant, and γ is the spectral index, which is typically around 2.7 for cosmic rays at Earth.\n\nThe energy spectrum of cosmic rays spans a wide range, from about 10^9 eV (1 GeV) to beyond 10^20 eV (100 EeV). The majority of cosmic rays are protons, followed by helium nuclei (alpha particles) and heavier nuclei. There is also a small fraction of electrons and positrons.\n\nAs cosmic rays enter Earth's atmosphere, they interact with the atmospheric nuclei, producing secondary particles such as pions, muons, and neutrinos. These secondary particles can also produce further interactions, leading to an extensive air shower of particles. The energy spectrum of cosmic rays at a given altitude depends on the balance between the production of secondary particles and the absorption of the primary and secondary cosmic rays in the atmosphere.\n\nAt higher altitudes, the atmosphere is less dense, and cosmic rays have a higher probability of penetrating deeper into the atmosphere without significant interactions. As a result, the energy spectrum at higher altitudes is closer to the original cosmic ray energy spectrum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAs the altitude decreases, the atmospheric density increases, leading to more interactions and a larger number of secondary particles. The energy spectrum at lower altitudes becomes dominated by these secondary particles, which have lower energies than the primary cosmic rays. This leads to a softening of the energy spectrum, with a larger fraction of lower-energy particles.\n\nIn summary, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth's atmosphere follows a power-law distribution, with the spectral index around 2.7. The energy spectrum varies with altitude, with higher altitudes having a spectrum closer to the original cosmic ray energy spectrum and lower altitudes having a softened spectrum due to the increased production of lower-energy secondary particles."
