    "message_2": "The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is the energy required to change the orientation of the magnetic moment with respect to the crystallographic axis. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nMAE = K * (1 - cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere K is the anisotropy constant, θ is the orientation angle with respect to the crystallographic axis, and cos is the cosine function.\n\nGiven the parameters:\n\nK = 3 x 10^4 J/m^3\nθ = 30 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (radians) = θ (degrees) * (π / 180)\nθ (radians) = 30 * (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, we can calculate the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(θ) = cos(π / 6) = √3 / 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the square of the cosine:\n\ncos^2(θ) = (√3 / 2)^2 = 3 / 4\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy:\n\nMAE = K * (1 - cos^2(θ))\nMAE = 3 x 10^4 J/m^3 * (1 - 3 / 4)\nMAE = 3 x 10^4 J/m^3 * (1 / 4)\nMAE = 7.5 x 10^3 J/m^3\n\nSo, the magnetic anisotropy energy of the material is 7.5 x 10^3 J/m^3."
