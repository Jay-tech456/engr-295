    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of niobium's superconductivity phase transition is approximately 9.2 Kelvin (K). At this temperature, niobium transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state, where it exhibits zero electrical resistance.\n\nThe behavior of the material's electrons plays a crucial role in this phase transition. In a superconducting state, electrons in niobium form Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by an attractive force mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). These Cooper pairs move through the material without scattering or losing energy, resulting in the superconducting state with zero electrical resistance.\n\nAbove the critical temperature, the thermal energy is too high for Cooper pairs to form and maintain their bound state. As a result, electrons behave as individual particles and scatter off impurities and lattice vibrations, leading to the normal conducting state with finite electrical resistance.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature in niobium's superconductivity phase transition is about 9.2 K, and it is closely related to the behavior of the material's electrons, which form Cooper pairs in the superconducting state and contribute to the zero electrical resistance property."
