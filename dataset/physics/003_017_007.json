    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is square and symmetric, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and then multiply by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The length of the side is 0.1 m, and the current is 2 A. The distance from the midpoint of the side to the center of the loop is half the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\ndiagonal = √(0.1² + 0.1²) = √(0.01 + 0.01) = √0.02\nhalf_diagonal = √0.02 / 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the loop at the center:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * 0.1 m x half_diagonal) / (half_diagonal)³\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, we can simplify the cross product:\n\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.1 m * half_diagonal) / (half_diagonal)³\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of half_diagonal and calculate dB:\n\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.1 m * √0.02 / 2) / (√0.02 / 2)³\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.2 A * m)\n\ndB = 2 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * dB = 4 * 2 × 10^(-8) T = 8 × 10^(-8) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing clockwise, the magnetic field at the center of the loop will be pointing downward (into the plane of the loop).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 8 × 10^(-8) T, and the direction is downward (into the plane of the loop)."
