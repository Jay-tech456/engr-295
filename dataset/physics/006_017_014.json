    "message_2": "The application of a magnetic field affects the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra in atoms by causing a splitting of the energy levels associated with the electron's spin states. This phenomenon is known as Zeeman splitting. In the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of the electrons with different spin orientations (spin up and spin down) will have different energies due to their interaction with the magnetic field.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic field strength (B) and the resonance frequency (ν) in ESR can be described by the following equation:\n\nν = g * μ_B * B / h\n\nwhere:\n- ν is the resonance frequency,\n- g is the g-factor (a dimensionless constant that depends on the specific atom and its electronic environment),\n- μ_B is the Bohr magneton (a fundamental constant that represents the magnetic moment of an electron),\n- B is the magnetic field strength, and\n- h is the Planck's constant.\n\nThis equation shows that the resonance frequency is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength. As the magnetic field strength increases, the energy difference between the spin states also increases, leading to a higher resonance frequency. This relationship is crucial in ESR spectroscopy, as it allows scientists to determine the g-factor and other properties of the atom or molecule under investigation by measuring the resonance frequency at various magnetic field strengths."
