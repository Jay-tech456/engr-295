The gas is expanded isothermally and reversibly from an initial volume of 2.0 L to a final volume of 4.0 L. What is the change in entropy of the system during this process?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) for an isothermal and reversible expansion of an ideal gas, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 0.5 moles\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (the ideal gas constant)\nVi = 2.0 L\nVf = 4.0 L\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volumes from liters to cubic meters:\n1 L = 0.001 m³\nVi = 2.0 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.002 m³\nVf = 4.0 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.004 m³\n\nNow we can calculate the change in entropy:\n\nΔS = (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * ln(0.004 m³ / 0.002 m³)\nΔS = (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * ln(2)\nΔS ≈ (0.5 mol) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (0.6931)\nΔS ≈ 2.877 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the system during this process is approximately 2.877 J/K."
