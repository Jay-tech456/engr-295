    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB created by a small segment of wire carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment of wire, θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the line connecting the wire segment to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and r is the distance from the wire segment to that point.\n\nIn the case of the square loop, we can divide each side of the loop into small segments and sum up the magnetic field contributions from each segment. However, due to symmetry, we can calculate the magnetic field created by one side of the loop and multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The side length is 0.2 m, and the current is 3 A. The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one side is half the side length (0.1 m). Since the current is parallel to the side, the angle θ between the current and the line connecting the midpoint of the side to the center of the square is 90 degrees, and sinθ = 1.\n\nWe can now calculate the magnetic field created by one side of the loop at the center:\n\ndB_side = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nIntegrating over the entire side, we get:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r) * ∫(dl / r)\n\nSince the distance r from each segment to the center is constant (0.1 m), we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r) * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl over the entire side is just the side length (0.2 m):\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * 0.2) / (4 * π * 0.1)\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * 0.2 m) / (4 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB_side = (3 * 0.2) / (0.1) × 10^(-7) T\n\nB_side = 6 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, we multiply the magnetic field created by one side by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * 6 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB_total = 24 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB_total = 2.4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 2.4 × 10^(-6) T."
