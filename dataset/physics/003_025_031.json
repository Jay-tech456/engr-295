    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. However, for a straight wire, it's more convenient to use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire at a distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current (I) is 5 A and the distance (r) is 2 cm (0.02 m), we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the current-carrying resistor is approximately 5 × 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the direction of the current flow."
