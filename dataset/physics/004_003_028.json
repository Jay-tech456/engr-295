    "message_2": "To calculate the curvature of spacetime around a massive spherical object, we can use the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the object from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the object is:\n\nM = 5 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 1.475 x 10^4 m\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from the observer to the object from kilometers to meters:\n\nDistance = 10,000 km * (1,000 m/km) = 1.0 x 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can find the dimensionless curvature parameter, which is the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius to the distance from the observer to the object:\n\nCurvature parameter = Rs / Distance\nCurvature parameter ≈ (1.475 x 10^4 m) / (1.0 x 10^7 m)\nCurvature parameter ≈ 1.475 x 10^-3\n\nThe curvature of spacetime around the massive spherical object with a mass of 5 solar masses located 10,000 kilometers away from an observer is characterized by a dimensionless curvature parameter of approximately 1.475 x 10^-3. This value is small, indicating that the spacetime curvature experienced by the observer is relatively weak."
