    "message_1": "A current-carrying sphere has a radius of 5 cm and a current of 2 A flowing through it. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the center of the sphere.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dL x r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dL is the differential length of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, since we have a current-carrying sphere, we need to integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire surface of the sphere. Let's assume that the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere. We can then consider a small area element dA on the surface of the sphere, carrying a small current dI.\n\ndI = I * (dA / A)\n\nwhere A is the total surface area of the sphere, given by:\n\nA = 4 * π * R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nNow, let's consider a point P at a distance r from the center of the sphere, where we want to calculate the magnetic field. The magnetic field due to the small current dI is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * dL x r') / (4 * π * r'^3)\n\nwhere r' is the position vector from the area element dA to the point P.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫(μ₀ * dI * dL x r') / (4 * π * r'^3) dA\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the sphere, the magnetic field at point P will have contributions from opposite points on the sphere that cancel each other out. This means that the net magnetic field at point P will be zero.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the center of the sphere is 0 T, and there is no specific direction since the field is zero."
