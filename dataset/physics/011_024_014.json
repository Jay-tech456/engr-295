Additionally, how do the surface states of a topological insulator differ from those of a conventional insulator, and what makes them protected against backscattering?",
    "message_2": "The band structure of a topological insulator made of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is characterized by an insulating bulk gap and conducting surface states. In a conventional insulator, the valence band is completely filled, and the conduction band is empty, with a significant energy gap between them. In contrast, a topological insulator like Bi2Se3 has an inverted band structure, where the valence and conduction bands are inverted due to strong spin-orbit coupling.\n\nThe surface states of a topological insulator are different from those of a conventional insulator in several ways. In a conventional insulator, there are no conducting surface states, as the material is insulating both in the bulk and at the surface. In a topological insulator, however, the surface states form a single, continuous, and gapless Dirac cone, which connects the valence and conduction bands. These surface states are characterized by a linear dispersion relation and are topologically protected.\n\nThe protection against backscattering in the surface states of a topological insulator arises from the unique properties of these states, which are governed by time-reversal symmetry and the spin-momentum locking. In spin-momentum locking, the electron's spin direction is locked perpendicular to its momentum, meaning that any scattering event that would reverse the electron's momentum would also have to reverse its spin. However, time-reversal symmetry prohibits such spin-flip scattering events, making the surface states immune to backscattering. This results in robust and dissipationless transport of charge carriers along the surface of a topological insulator, which is a key feature distinguishing it from conventional insulators."
