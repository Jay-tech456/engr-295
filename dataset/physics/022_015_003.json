    "message_2": "Distinguishing between the different proposed masses for axions in order to experimentally detect them as a possible constituent of dark matter can be achieved through a variety of experimental approaches. These approaches are designed to exploit the unique properties of axions, such as their coupling to photons and their potential role in the cooling of stars. Here are some of the key experimental methods:\n\n1. Axion haloscopes: These experiments search for axions in the form of dark matter by looking for their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is a prominent example of such an experiment. It uses a high-Q microwave cavity inside a strong magnetic field to enhance the conversion of axions into photons. By tuning the cavity's resonant frequency, researchers can probe different axion masses. The sensitivity of this experiment currently covers the mass range of 10^{-6} eV to 10^{-5} eV.\n\n2. Axion helioscopes: These experiments aim to detect axions produced in the Sun. The most well-known example is the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), which uses a strong magnetic field to convert solar axions into X-ray photons. By analyzing the energy spectrum of the detected photons, researchers can infer the mass of the axions. CAST has explored axion masses up to 10^{-3} eV.\n\n3. Light-shining-through-walls (LSW) experiments: In these experiments, a laser beam is shone onto a barrier, and a detector is placed on the other side of the barrier to look for photons that have been converted from axions. The ALPS experiment at DESY is an example of an LSW experiment. By varying the laser frequency, researchers can probe different axion masses.\n\n4. Astrophysical observations: The cooling rates of stars, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, can be influenced by the presence of axions. By comparing the observed cooling rates with theoretical predictions, researchers can place constraints on the axion mass. This method has been used to probe axion masses in the range of 10^{-6} eV to 10^{-3} eV.\n\n5. Cosmological observations: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe can also provide information about the axion mass. By comparing the observed CMB and large-scale structure data with theoretical predictions that include axions, researchers can place constraints on the axion mass.\n\nIn summary, a combination of laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations, and cosmological data can be used to distinguish between different proposed masses for axions and to experimentally detect them as a possible constituent of dark matter. Each method has its own range of sensitivity, and by combining the results from multiple experiments and observations, researchers can cover a wide range of axion masses."
