    "message_2": "In a gravitational lens scenario, the deflection angle of light is influenced by the mass distribution of the lensing object, which includes both visible and dark matter. General Relativity (GR) predicts the deflection angle of light due to the presence of mass, and this prediction remains valid even when dark matter is included.\n\nThe deflection angle (α) in GR can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the lensing object (including both visible and dark matter), c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the distance of closest approach of the light to the lensing mass).\n\nIn a scenario without dark matter, the deflection angle would be calculated using only the visible mass (M_visible) of the lensing object:\n\nα_no_dark_matter = (4 * G * M_visible) / (c^2 * b)\n\nTo find the predicted change in the observed deflection angle due to the presence of dark matter, we can subtract the deflection angle without dark matter from the deflection angle with both visible and dark matter:\n\nΔα = α - α_no_dark_matter\n\nΔα = [(4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)] - [(4 * G * M_visible) / (c^2 * b)]\n\nSince the factors 4, G, c^2, and b are common in both terms, we can simplify the expression:\n\nΔα = (4 * G / (c^2 * b)) * (M - M_visible)\n\nThe change in the deflection angle (Δα) depends on the difference between the total mass (M) and the visible mass (M_visible) of the lensing object. If there is a significant amount of dark matter present, the difference between M and M_visible will be larger, and the change in the deflection angle will be more significant.\n\nIn summary, the predicted change in the observed deflection angle of light due to the presence of dark matter in a gravitational lens scenario can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔα = (4 * G / (c^2 * b)) * (M - M_visible)\n\nThis change in deflection angle is a direct result of the additional mass contributed by dark matter, and it can be used to infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in lensing systems."
