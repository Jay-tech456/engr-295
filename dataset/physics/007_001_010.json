    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released when one kilogram of uranium-235 undergoes complete nuclear fission, we need to know the energy released per fission event and the number of fission events occurring in one kilogram of uranium-235.\n\n1. Energy released per fission event:\nThe energy released per fission event of uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts). To convert this to joules, we can use the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J. \n\n200 MeV = 200 x 10^6 eV = 200 x 10^6 x 1.602 x 10^(-19) J ≈ 3.204 x 10^(-11) J\n\n2. Number of fission events in one kilogram of uranium-235:\nFirst, we need to find the number of uranium-235 atoms in one kilogram. The molar mass of uranium-235 is approximately 235 g/mol. \n\n1 kg of uranium-235 = 1000 g\n\nNumber of moles = (mass) / (molar mass) = 1000 g / 235 g/mol ≈ 4.255 moles\n\nNow, we can find the number of uranium-235 atoms using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol).\n\nNumber of uranium-235 atoms = 4.255 moles x 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol ≈ 2.561 x 10^24 atoms\n\n3. Total energy released:\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released by multiplying the energy released per fission event by the number of fission events (atoms) in one kilogram of uranium-235.\n\nTotal energy released = (3.204 x 10^(-11) J/fission) x (2.561 x 10^24 atoms) ≈ 8.2 x 10^13 J\n\nSo, the amount of energy released when one kilogram of uranium-235 undergoes complete nuclear fission is approximately 8.2 x 10^13 joules."
