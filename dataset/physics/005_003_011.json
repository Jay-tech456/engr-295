    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question:\n\nA spaceship is travelling at 0.8c relative to Earth. A person inside the spaceship throws a ball in the opposite direction to the motion of the spaceship with a velocity of 0.4c relative to the spaceship. What is the velocity of the ball relative to Earth? Use relativistic velocity addition formula to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the combined velocity, v1 is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth, v2 is the velocity of the ball relative to the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.8c and v2 = -0.4c (negative because the ball is thrown in the opposite direction of the spaceship's motion).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nv = (0.8c - 0.4c) / (1 + (0.8c * -0.4c) / c^2)\n\nv = (0.4c) / (1 - 0.32)\n\nv = (0.4c) / 0.68\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.5882c\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball relative to Earth is approximately 0.5882c."
