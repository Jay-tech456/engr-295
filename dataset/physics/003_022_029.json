    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the DC motor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A)\n- I is the current (4.5 A)\n- dl is the length of the wire (0.2 m)\n- r is the distance from the center of the motor (0.05 m)\n\nHowever, the Biot-Savart Law is applicable for an infinitely long straight wire. Since the DC motor is not an infinitely long straight wire, we need to make some assumptions and approximations. We can assume that the motor has a cylindrical shape, and the current is uniformly distributed along the circumference of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field inside the cylinder:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- r is the distance from the center of the motor (0.05 m)\n- I_enclosed is the current enclosed by the loop (4.5 A)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 4.5 A) / (2π * 0.05 m)\n\nB ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the DC motor is approximately 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla). Keep in mind that this is an approximation based on the assumption of a cylindrical shape and uniform current distribution. The actual magnetic field may vary depending on the specific geometry and design of the motor."
