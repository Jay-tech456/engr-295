    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted by gravitational waves during a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE_GW = (G * M^2 * R) / (5 * c^5 * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E_GW is the energy emitted by gravitational waves\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the stellar core\n- R is the distance to the observer\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- t is the duration of the supernova explosion\n\nHowever, this formula is a rough estimation and assumes that the supernova explosion is spherically symmetric, which is not always the case. In reality, the energy emitted by gravitational waves during a supernova explosion can be highly dependent on the specific details of the explosion, such as the distribution of mass and the dynamics of the explosion.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimation, one would need to perform numerical simulations of the supernova explosion, taking into account the complex physics involved, such as general relativity, hydrodynamics, and nuclear reactions."
