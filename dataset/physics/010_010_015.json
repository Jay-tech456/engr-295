    "message_2": "To determine the pressure drop across a length of the pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow in a pipe. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is given by:\n\n$\\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4}$\n\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $L$ is the length of the pipe, $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate, and $R$ is the radius of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volumetric flow rate $Q$. We can do this using the formula:\n\n$Q = A \\cdot v$\n\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and $v$ is the velocity of the fluid. The cross-sectional area of the pipe can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$A = \\pi R^2$\n\nGiven the diameter of the pipe is 0.1 m, the radius is:\n\n$R = \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{0.1\\text{ m}}{2} = 0.05\\text{ m}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross-sectional area:\n\n$A = \\pi (0.05\\text{ m})^2 = 0.00785\\text{ m}^2$\n\nNext, we can find the volumetric flow rate:\n\n$Q = A \\cdot v = 0.00785\\text{ m}^2 \\cdot 2\\text{ m/s} = 0.0157\\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\n$\\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\cdot 0.01\\text{ N-s/m}^2 \\cdot 10\\text{ m} \\cdot 0.0157\\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}}{\\pi (0.05\\text{ m})^4} = 10000\\text{ Pa}$\n\nSo, the pressure drop across a length of 10 m of the pipe is 10000 Pa."
