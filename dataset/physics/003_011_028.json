    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center point of a uniform current-carrying disc, we can use the formula derived from Biot-Savart Law for a current-carrying disc:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (z² + R²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and z is the distance from the center of the disc to the point where we want to find the magnetic field. In this case, z = 0 since we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the disc.\n\nGiven the radius R = 0.1 meters and the current I = 5 amps, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * 0.01 m²)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (0.02 m²)\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center point of the uniform current-carrying disc is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
