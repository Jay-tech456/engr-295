    "message_2": "To locate the image using a ray diagram, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a line representing the principal axis of the mirror.\n2. Mark the focal point (F) and the center of curvature (C) on the principal axis, both at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror (since the focal length is 10 cm, the center of curvature is twice the focal length).\n3. Place the object (O) on the principal axis, 20 cm away from the mirror.\n4. Draw a ray from the top of the object (O) parallel to the principal axis. This ray will reflect off the mirror and pass through the focal point (F).\n5. Draw another ray from the top of the object (O) that passes through the focal point (F). This ray will reflect off the mirror and become parallel to the principal axis.\n6. The point where these two reflected rays intersect is the location of the top of the image (I).\n\nNow, to calculate the magnification of the image, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula:\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length (10 cm)\nu = object distance (20 cm)\nv = image distance\nM = magnification\n\nFirst, we'll find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/20\n1/v = (2 - 1)/20\n1/v = 1/20\nv = 20 cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -20/20\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
