    "message_2": "To calculate the change in energy levels and the corresponding change in wavelength of emitted light when a hydrogen atom undergoes the Zeeman effect, we need to consider both the normal and anomalous Zeeman effect.\n\n1. Normal Zeeman Effect:\nThe normal Zeeman effect occurs when the electron's spin angular momentum is zero (S = 0). The change in energy levels is given by:\n\nΔE = m_l * e * B * h_bar / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere m_l is the magnetic quantum number (-1, 0, 1), e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), B is the magnetic field (0.5 T), h_bar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nFor m_l = -1, 0, 1, we have:\n\nΔE(-1) = -1 * 1.6 × 10^(-19) * 0.5 * 1.054 × 10^(-34) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31))\nΔE(0) = 0\nΔE(1) = 1 * 1.6 × 10^(-19) * 0.5 * 1.054 × 10^(-34) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31))\n\nΔE(-1) ≈ -2.88 × 10^(-5) eV\nΔE(1) ≈ 2.88 × 10^(-5) eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in wavelength using the energy-wavelength relation:\n\nΔλ = h * c / ΔE\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) and c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nΔλ(-1) ≈ 6.626 × 10^(-34) * 3 × 10^8 / (2.88 × 10^(-5) * 1.6 × 10^(-19))\nΔλ(1) ≈ 6.626 × 10^(-34) * 3 × 10^8 / (2.88 × 10^(-5) * 1.6 × 10^(-19))\n\nΔλ(-1) ≈ 4.31 × 10^(-9) m\nΔλ(1) ≈ -4.31 × 10^(-9) m\n\n2. Anomalous Zeeman Effect:\nThe anomalous Zeeman effect occurs when the electron's spin angular momentum is non-zero (S ≠ 0). For hydrogen, the ground state has S = 1/2, so the total angular momentum J can be either 1/2 or 3/2. However, since we are considering the ground state (n = 1), the only possible value for J is 1/2. In this case, the energy shift is given by the same formula as for the normal Zeeman effect, and the results are the same:\n\nΔE(-1) ≈ -2.88 × 10^(-5) eV\nΔE(0) = 0\nΔE(1) ≈ 2.88 × 10^(-5) eV\n\nΔλ(-1) ≈ 4.31 × 10^(-9) m\nΔλ(1) ≈ -4.31 × 10^(-9) m\n\nIn conclusion, for both the normal and anomalous Zeeman effect in the ground state of hydrogen, the change in energy levels is approximately ±2.88 × 10^(-5) eV, and the corresponding change in wavelength is approximately ±4.31 × 10^(-9) m."
