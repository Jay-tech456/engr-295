    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The Higgs boson has several decay modes, which are the various ways it can decay into other particles. These decay modes have different probabilities, known as branching ratios, and are determined by the properties of the Higgs boson and the particles it decays into.\n\nHere are some of the main decay modes of the Higgs boson:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quarks (H → bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. The Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark and its antiparticle, the bottom antiquark.\n\n2. Higgs to W bosons (H → WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. The Higgs boson decays into a W+ boson and a W- boson, which are responsible for the weak nuclear force.\n\n3. Higgs to gluons (H → gg): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 9%. The Higgs boson decays into two gluons, which are the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force.\n\n4. Higgs to tau leptons (H → ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6%. The Higgs boson decays into a tau lepton and its antiparticle, the tau antilepton.\n\n5. Higgs to Z bosons (H → ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.7%. The Higgs boson decays into a Z boson and its antiparticle, which are also responsible for the weak nuclear force.\n\n6. Higgs to photons (H → γγ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%. The Higgs boson decays into two photons, which are the carrier particles for the electromagnetic force.\n\n7. Higgs to charm quarks (H → cc), muons (H → μμ), and other less common decays: These decay modes have smaller branching ratios, but they are still important for understanding the properties of the Higgs boson and its interactions with other particles.\n\nThe properties of these decay modes, such as their branching ratios and the particles they produce, are determined by the Higgs boson's interactions with other particles in the Standard Model. By studying these decay modes and their properties, physicists can learn more about the Higgs boson and its role in the universe."
