    "message_2": "The collapse of massive stars leading to the formation of black holes is a fascinating process that involves several stages. The size and lifespan of these black holes are determined by factors such as the mass of the progenitor star and the angular momentum it possesses. Let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. Stellar evolution and core collapse: Massive stars, typically those with masses greater than 20 solar masses, undergo nuclear fusion in their cores, converting hydrogen into helium, and subsequently into heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and eventually iron. This process releases energy in the form of radiation, which counteracts the force of gravity and maintains the star's stability. However, once the core is predominantly composed of iron, further fusion becomes energetically unfavorable, and the core can no longer produce enough energy to support the star's outer layers.\n\n2. Supernova explosion: As the core collapses under its own gravity, it becomes extremely dense and hot. The core's collapse is halted by the strong nuclear force and degeneracy pressure, causing it to rebound and send a shockwave through the outer layers of the star. This shockwave, along with the release of a large number of neutrinos, leads to a supernova explosion, which ejects the star's outer layers into space.\n\n3. Formation of a black hole: If the core's mass after the supernova explosion is greater than the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is approximately 2-3 solar masses, the core will continue to collapse under its own gravity. The core's density increases to the point where it warps spacetime, creating an event horizon â€“ a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. This marks the formation of a black hole.\n\nThe size and lifespan of a black hole are primarily determined by its mass and angular momentum:\n\n1. Mass: The mass of a black hole is directly related to the size of its event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius. The more massive a black hole is, the larger its event horizon will be. The mass of a black hole is also related to its lifespan, as black holes can lose mass through a process called Hawking radiation. However, for stellar-mass black holes, this process is extremely slow, and their lifespans are much longer than the current age of the universe.\n\n2. Angular momentum: The angular momentum of a black hole is related to its spin. A rapidly spinning black hole has a more oblate event horizon and is surrounded by an ergosphere, a region where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime along with it. The spin of a black hole can affect its growth and interactions with its surroundings, as well as the properties of any accretion disk that may form around it.\n\nIn summary, the collapse of massive stars leads to the formation of black holes when their cores become so dense and massive that they warp spacetime, creating an event horizon. The size and lifespan of these black holes are determined by factors such as their mass and angular momentum, with more massive and rapidly spinning black holes having larger event horizons and potentially more complex interactions with their surroundings."
