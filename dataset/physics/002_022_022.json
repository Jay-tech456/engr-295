    "message_2": "To calculate the concentration of the salt in the solution, we first need to determine the number of moles of salt present in the solution. We can do this using the formula:\n\nmoles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\n\nThe molar mass of salt (NaCl) is approximately 58.44 g/mol. So, we can calculate the moles of salt as follows:\n\nmoles = 5 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.0856 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of the salt in the solution using the formula:\n\nconcentration (M) = moles / volume (L)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume from mL to L:\n\n100 mL = 0.1 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration:\n\nconcentration = 0.0856 mol / 0.1 L = 0.856 M\n\nSince the activity coefficient of the salt is 0.9, we need to multiply the concentration by the activity coefficient to get the effective concentration:\n\neffective concentration = 0.856 M * 0.9 = 0.7704 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the salt in the solution is approximately 0.7704 M."
