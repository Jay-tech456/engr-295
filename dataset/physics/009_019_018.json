    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the central bright spot and the first bright fringe, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central bright spot and the first bright fringe\nm = order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe)\nλ = wavelength of the light (600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m)\nL = distance between the screen and the double-slit setup (1.5 m)\nd = distance between the two slits (0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ny = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9) * 1.5) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\n\ny = (900 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\n\ny = 0.0045 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central bright spot and the first bright fringe is 0.0045 meters or 4.5 millimeters."
