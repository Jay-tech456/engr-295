    "message_2": "To determine the splitting of the spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field, we can use the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of spectral lines due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the electron.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom with one electron in the n=3 state, we need to consider the 3P levels (l=1). The magnetic quantum number (m_l) can take values -1, 0, and 1. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_l * g_l\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (0.5 T), m_l is the magnetic quantum number, and g_l is the Landé g-factor (for the orbital angular momentum, g_l = 1).\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy shift for each m_l value:\n\nFor m_l = -1:\nΔE(-1) = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * (-1) * 1 = -4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nFor m_l = 0:\nΔE(0) = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * (0) * 1 = 0 J\n\nFor m_l = 1:\nΔE(1) = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * (1) * 1 = 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nThe splitting of the spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field of strength 0.5 Tesla for the hydrogen atom in the n=3 state, considering only the 3P levels, is given by the energy difference between the highest and lowest m_l values:\n\nSplitting = ΔE(1) - ΔE(-1) = (4.637 x 10^-24 J) - (-4.637 x 10^-24 J) = 9.274 x 10^-24 J"
