    "message_2": "The current scientific explanation for the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion is attributed to a mysterious force called dark energy. In 1998, observations of distant Type Ia supernovae provided evidence that the expansion of the universe was not only continuing but also accelerating. This unexpected discovery led to the development of the concept of dark energy, which is believed to make up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe.\n\nDark energy is thought to be a form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a negative pressure, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, and it remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in modern physics. Some theories propose that dark energy is a property of the vacuum itself, while others suggest it could be a new type of fundamental field or a modification of general relativity.\n\nDark matter, on the other hand, is a separate phenomenon that is related to the observed gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it extremely difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational influence on the motion of visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nAlthough both dark energy and dark matter are mysterious and not yet fully understood, they play different roles in the universe's expansion. Dark energy is responsible for the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion, while dark matter contributes to the overall gravitational effects that influence the formation and behavior of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The presence of dark matter does not directly cause the acceleration of the universe's expansion, but it is an essential component in understanding the overall dynamics and evolution of the cosmos."
