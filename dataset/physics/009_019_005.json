    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the distance between consecutive bright spots (fringes) on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (位 * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance between consecutive bright spots, 位 is the wavelength of light used, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\ny = 5.0 millimeters = 5.0 * 10^(-3) meters\n位 = 550 nanometers = 550 * 10^(-9) meters\nL = 1.5 meters\n\nWe need to find the value of d. Rearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (位 * L) / y\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nd = (550 * 10^(-9) * 1.5) / (5.0 * 10^(-3))\n\nd = (825 * 10^(-9)) / (5.0 * 10^(-3))\n\nd = 165 * 10^(-6) meters\n\nd = 165 micrometers\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the Young's Double Slit Experiment is 165 micrometers."
