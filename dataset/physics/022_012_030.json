    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and it is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nDark matter affects the formation of large-scale structures in the universe in the following ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to pull ordinary matter (gas, dust, and stars) together to form galaxies and galaxy clusters. Without dark matter, the gravitational force exerted by ordinary matter alone would not be sufficient to form these structures.\n\n2. Cosmic web: Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, a large-scale structure of the universe consisting of interconnected filaments of dark matter and gas. This web acts as a scaffold for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, which form at the densest regions where the filaments intersect.\n\n3. Stability of galaxies: The presence of dark matter in galaxies helps to stabilize them by providing additional mass, which increases the gravitational force holding the galaxy together. This prevents the galaxy from being torn apart by the rotational forces of its stars and gas.\n\nPhysical evidence supporting the role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars in galaxies show that they do not decrease with distance from the galactic center, as would be expected if only the visible matter were present. This suggests that there is additional, unseen mass (dark matter) providing the extra gravitational force needed to maintain these rotation speeds.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive foreground object, such as a galaxy cluster, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the cluster. These maps reveal the presence of dark matter, as the total mass inferred from the lensing is much greater than the mass of the visible matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains tiny temperature fluctuations that provide information about the early universe's composition. Analysis of the CMB data indicates that dark matter was present in the early universe and played a role in the formation of large-scale structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure surveys: Observations of the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe show a pattern consistent with the presence of dark matter. The distribution of these structures matches the predictions of computer simulations that include dark matter as a key component.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter is essential for the formation and stability of large-scale structures in the universe. Multiple lines of physical evidence, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB radiation, and large-scale structure surveys, support this role."
