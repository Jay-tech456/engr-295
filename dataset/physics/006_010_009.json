    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, alpha particles are scattered by the positively charged nucleus of an atom. The relationship between the scattering angle (θ) and the impact parameter (b) can be derived from the Rutherford scattering formula, which is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (k^2) / (16 * π * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nwhere dσ is the differential cross-section, dΩ is the solid angle, k is the electrostatic constant, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nThe impact parameter (b) is the perpendicular distance between the initial trajectory of the alpha particle and the center of the nucleus. The relationship between the impact parameter and the scattering angle can be expressed as:\n\nb = (k * Ze * Zα * e^2) / (2 * Eα * cot(θ/2))\n\nwhere Ze is the atomic number of the target nucleus, Zα is the atomic number of the alpha particle, e is the elementary charge, and Eα is the energy of the alpha particle.\n\nTo determine the size of the nucleus, Rutherford used the scattering angle at which the number of scattered alpha particles dropped significantly. This angle corresponds to the point where the alpha particles are deflected by the strong nuclear force, which is much stronger than the electrostatic force at short distances. By measuring the scattering angle and knowing the energy of the alpha particles, the impact parameter can be calculated, which gives an estimate of the size of the nucleus.\n\nThe size of the nucleus can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the nuclear radius, R₀ is a constant (approximately 1.2 fm), and A is the mass number of the nucleus. By comparing the experimentally obtained impact parameter with the calculated nuclear radius, one can verify the accuracy of the nuclear size estimation."
