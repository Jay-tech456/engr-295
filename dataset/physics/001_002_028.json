    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum for a particle confined to a box of width \"L\", we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nIn this case, the particle is confined to a box of width \"L\", so the uncertainty in position (Δx) is approximately equal to the width of the box, L.\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nL * Δp_min ≥ ħ/2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nΔp_min ≥ ħ/(2L)\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in momentum for a particle confined to a box of width \"L\" is greater than or equal to ħ/(2L)."
