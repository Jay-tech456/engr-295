Given that the initial state has a probability of 90% of being a muon neutrino and 10% of being an electron neutrino, and the neutrino mass-squared difference is 2.5 x 10^-3 eV^2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the neutrino oscillation formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, θ is the mixing angle between the two neutrino flavors, Δm² is the neutrino mass-squared difference (in eV²), L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km), and E is the neutrino energy (in GeV).\n\nHowever, we are not given the mixing angle θ or the neutrino energy E, so we cannot directly calculate the probability using this formula.\n\nInstead, we can use the given initial state probabilities and the fact that the probability of oscillation depends on the distance traveled. Since the probability of oscillation is a function of distance, we can only provide a general expression for the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino at a distance of 500 km:\n\nP(νμ → νe, 500 km) = 0.9 * sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * 500 km / E) + 0.1\n\nThis expression takes into account the initial state probabilities and the distance traveled but still depends on the unknown mixing angle θ and neutrino energy E. To obtain a numerical value for the probability, we would need more information about these parameters."
