    "message_2": "To calculate the change in binding free energy (ΔG) of a protein-ligand interaction at 25°C, we can use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔG is the change in binding free energy, ΔH is the enthalpic change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropic change.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for ΔH and ΔS into the equation. However, since we don't have the specific values for ΔH and ΔS, I'll write the equation in a more general form:\n\nΔG = ΔH - (298.15 K) * ΔS\n\nOnce you have the values for ΔH and ΔS, you can plug them into the equation to calculate the change in binding free energy (ΔG) for the protein-ligand interaction at 25°C."
