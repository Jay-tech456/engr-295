    "message_1": "One problem a student could solve involves calculating the rotational energy and angular momentum of a rotating black hole using the Kerr metric. Specifically, they could be tasked with finding the angular velocity of the event horizon and using it to calculate these parameters for a given black hole.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the Kerr metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations that describes the geometry of spacetime around a rotating black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - rs / ρ²) dt² + (ρ² / Δ) dr² + ρ² dθ² + (r² + a² + (rs a² sin²θ) / ρ²) sin²θ dφ² - 2(rs a sin²θ) / ρ² dt dφ\n\nwhere\n- ds² is the spacetime interval\n- rs = 2GM/c² is the Schwarzschild radius\n- ρ² = r² + a²cos²θ\n- Δ = r² - rsr + a²\n- a = J/M is the specific angular momentum of the black hole\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light\n- J is the angular momentum of the black hole\n- t, r, θ, and φ are the time, radial, polar, and azimuthal coordinates, respectively\n\nThe angular velocity of the event horizon (ΩH) can be found using the following formula:\n\nΩH = a / (rH² + a²)\n\nwhere rH is the radius of the event horizon, which can be calculated as:\n\nrH = rs / 2 + sqrt((rs / 2)² - a²)\n\nNow, we can calculate the rotational energy (Erot) and angular momentum (L) of the rotating black hole:\n\n1. Rotational energy (Erot):\n\nErot = (1/2) * J * ΩH\n\n2. Angular momentum (L):\n\nL = J\n\nGiven the mass (M) and angular momentum (J) of a black hole, we can now calculate the angular velocity of the event horizon (ΩH), the rotational energy (Erot), and the angular momentum (L) of the black hole."
