    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the rectangular loop, we can simplify the calculation by considering the contributions of the magnetic field from each side of the rectangle.\n\nLet's label the sides of the rectangle as follows:\n- Side 1: Length 0.2 m (along the x-axis)\n- Side 2: Length 0.4 m (along the y-axis)\n- Side 3: Length 0.2 m (along the x-axis)\n- Side 4: Length 0.4 m (along the y-axis)\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop due to each side can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire to the center of the loop.\n\nFor sides 1 and 3 (length 0.2 m), the distance r is 0.2 m. For sides 2 and 4 (length 0.4 m), the distance r is 0.1 m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to each side:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.2 m) = 2.5 × 10^(-6) T (out of the plane)\nB₂ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.1 m) = 5 × 10^(-6) T (into the plane)\n\nSince the magnetic fields due to sides 1 and 3 are in the same direction (out of the plane), we can add them together:\n\nB₁₃ = 2 * B₁ = 5 × 10^(-6) T (out of the plane)\n\nSimilarly, the magnetic fields due to sides 2 and 4 are in the same direction (into the plane), so we can add them together:\n\nB₂₄ = 2 * B₂ = 10 × 10^(-6) T (into the plane)\n\nNow, we can find the net magnetic field at the center of the loop by subtracting the magnetic fields due to sides 1 and 3 from the magnetic fields due to sides 2 and 4:\n\nB_net = B₂₄ - B₁₃ = 10 × 10^(-6) T - 5 × 10^(-6) T = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe net magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 5 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is into the plane (opposite to the direction of the magnetic field due to sides 1 and 3)."
