    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star are influenced by several factors, including the mass of the star, the dynamics of the collapse, and the time elapsed since the onset of the collapse.\n\n1. Mass of the star: The mass of the collapsing star plays a crucial role in determining the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced. More massive stars generate stronger gravitational waves due to their larger mass and energy involved in the collapse. The amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the star and the rate of change of its quadrupole moment (a measure of the distribution of mass within the star).\n\n2. Time: As the star collapses, its core contracts, and the outer layers fall inward. This process increases the density and temperature of the core, leading to a more rapid collapse. The amplitude of the gravitational waves increases as the collapse progresses, reaching a maximum when the core bounces back (in the case of a core-collapse supernova) or when the star forms a black hole. The frequency of the gravitational waves also increases with time, as the collapsing material moves faster and the size of the core decreases.\n\n3. Dynamics of the collapse: The specific dynamics of the star's collapse also affect the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced. For example, if the collapse is highly asymmetric, the quadrupole moment of the star changes more rapidly, leading to stronger gravitational waves. Additionally, the presence of rotation can introduce higher frequency components to the gravitational wave signal.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star are influenced by the mass of the star, the time elapsed since the onset of the collapse, and the dynamics of the collapse. More massive stars and more rapid or asymmetric collapses generate stronger and higher frequency gravitational waves. As the collapse progresses, both the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves generally increase."
