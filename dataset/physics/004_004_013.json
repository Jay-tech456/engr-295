    "message_2": "In General Relativity, the motion of a planet around a star is described by the geodesic equation. The geodesic equation is derived from the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to the Einstein field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)^(-1)dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nFor a planet orbiting in the equatorial plane (θ = π/2), the geodesic equation can be simplified. The conserved energy E and angular momentum L of the planet are given by:\n\nE = (1 - 2GM/c²r)(dt/dτ)\nL = r²(dφ/dτ)\n\nwhere τ is the proper time.\n\nUsing these conserved quantities, we can express the geodesic equation in terms of the radial coordinate r and the azimuthal angle φ:\n\n(d²r/dφ²) - 3GM/c²r²(dr/dφ)² + (GM/c²r - L²/c²r³) = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find the effective potential V_eff(r) and express the equation in terms of the radial coordinate r and the azimuthal angle φ:\n\nV_eff(r) = L²/(2r²) - GM/r + GML²/c²r³\n\nNow, we can use the given values of the eccentricity e = 0.3 and the semi-major axis a = 1.5 x 10^11 meters to find the perihelion r_min and aphelion r_max of the orbit:\n\nr_min = a(1 - e) = 1.5 x 10^11 * (1 - 0.3) = 1.05 x 10^11 meters\nr_max = a(1 + e) = 1.5 x 10^11 * (1 + 0.3) = 1.95 x 10^11 meters\n\nUsing these values, we can find the angular momentum L and energy E of the planet:\n\nL² = GMr_minr_max/(r_max - r_min)\nE² = (1 - 2GM/c²r_min)(1 - 2GM/c²r_max)\n\nNow, we can solve the geodesic equation numerically using these initial conditions and the effective potential V_eff(r). The shape of the trajectory will be an ellipse, as expected from the given eccentricity and semi-major axis. However, due to the effects of General Relativity, the orbit will not be a perfect ellipse, and the perihelion will precess over time. This precession is one of the key predictions of General Relativity and has been observed in the motion of planets in our solar system, most notably Mercury."
