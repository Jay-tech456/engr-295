    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of diffraction for the first order, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the diffraction (in this case, n = 1 for the first order), λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines in the grating, and θ is the angle of diffraction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines in the grating (d). We know that there are 5000 lines per centimeter, so we can convert that to meters:\n\n5000 lines/cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 50000 lines/m\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the lines:\n\nd = 1 / 50000 lines/m = 2 * 10^(-5) m\n\nNext, we need to convert the wavelength of the light from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5 * 10^(-7) m\n\nNow, we can use the grating equation to find the angle of diffraction:\n\n1 * (5 * 10^(-7) m) = (2 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (5 * 10^(-7) m) / (2 * 10^(-5) m) = 0.025\n\nθ = arcsin(0.025)\n\nθ ≈ 1.43°\n\nSo, the angle of diffraction for the first order is approximately 1.43°."
