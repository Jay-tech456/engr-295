    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (C.O.P) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat extracted from the food compartment to the work done (electrical energy consumed) by the refrigerator. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nC.O.P = (Heat extracted from the food compartment) / (Electrical energy consumed)\n\nWe are given the C.O.P as 4.5 and the rate at which heat is extracted from the food compartment as 250 J/s. We need to find the rate at which the refrigerator consumes electrical energy.\n\nLet's denote the rate of electrical energy consumption as W. Using the formula for C.O.P, we can write:\n\n4.5 = (250 J/s) / W\n\nNow, we can solve for W:\n\nW = (250 J/s) / 4.5\n\nW â‰ˆ 55.56 J/s\n\nSo, the rate at which the refrigerator consumes electrical energy is approximately 55.56 J/s."
