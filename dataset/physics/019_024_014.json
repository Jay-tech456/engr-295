    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a black hole with a mass of 10^23 kg according to the Hawking radiation in Quantum field theory, we first need to find the temperature of the black hole. The temperature of a black hole is given by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m³/kg s²), M is the mass of the black hole (10^23 kg), and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js × (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)³) / (8π × (6.674 × 10^-11 m³/kg s²) × 10^23 kg × 1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K)\nT ≈ 1.227 × 10^-8 K\n\nNow that we have the temperature, we can find the energy of the black hole using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the energy radiated by a black body to its temperature:\n\nE = σAT⁴\n\nwhere E is the energy, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.670374 × 10^-8 W/m²K⁴), A is the surface area of the black hole, and T is the temperature.\n\nThe surface area of a black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c²\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nr_s = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m³/kg s²) × 10^23 kg / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²\nr_s ≈ 1.485 × 10^-3 m\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nA = 4πr²\n\nA = 4π × (1.485 × 10^-3 m)²\nA ≈ 2.761 × 10^-5 m²\n\nNow we can calculate the energy:\n\nE = (5.670374 × 10^-8 W/m²K⁴) × 2.761 × 10^-5 m² × (1.227 × 10^-8 K)⁴\nE ≈ 1.068 × 10^-28 W\n\nThe energy of a black hole with a mass of 10^23 kg according to the Hawking radiation in Quantum field theory is approximately 1.068 × 10^-28 W."
