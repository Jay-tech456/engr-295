    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. It is the point of no return for any object that crosses it. The size of the event horizon is directly related to the mass of the black hole. The larger the mass, the larger the event horizon.\n\nThe formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is the radius of the event horizon, is given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo determine the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass twice that of the sun, we first need to know the mass of the sun, which is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole would be 2 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^30 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)(3.978 x 10^30 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 5.906 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass twice that of the sun is approximately 5,906 meters or 5.906 kilometers."
