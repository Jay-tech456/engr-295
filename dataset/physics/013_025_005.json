    "message_2": "The maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton could have when it reaches the Earth's surface is on the order of 10^20 electron volts (eV), which is about 16 Joules. This value is based on the highest energy cosmic rays observed, known as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). However, it is important to note that such high-energy cosmic rays are extremely rare.\n\nWhen cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere, they produce secondary particles through a cascade of reactions. These secondary particles, including muons, neutrons, and other subatomic particles, can penetrate the Earth's surface and reach sensitive electronics.\n\nThe technological impact of cosmic rays on sensitive electronics, particularly in devices with small feature sizes like modern integrated circuits, can be significant. Cosmic rays can cause single-event upsets (SEUs), which are transient errors in digital circuits due to the passage of ionizing particles. SEUs can lead to bit flips in memory cells, causing data corruption and potentially system failures.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of cosmic rays on sensitive electronics, various shielding and error-correction techniques are employed. Shielding can be done using materials like aluminum, lead, or plastic, which can absorb or deflect the incoming particles. Error-correction techniques, such as error-correcting codes (ECC) and redundancy, can help detect and correct bit flips caused by cosmic rays.\n\nIn summary, the maximum energy of a cosmic ray proton reaching the Earth's surface is around 10^20 eV, and its impact on sensitive electronics can cause transient errors and system failures. To minimize these effects, shielding and error-correction techniques are used in the design of electronic systems."
