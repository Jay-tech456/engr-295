    "message_2": "Oxygen-17 (17O) is an isotope of oxygen with 8 protons and 9 neutrons. To determine the nuclear spin and parity, we need to consider the shell model of the nucleus and the angular momenta and parities of the individual nucleons.\n\nIn the case of 17O, the last unpaired nucleon is a neutron. The neutron shell model filling order is 1s1/2, 1p3/2, 1p1/2, 1d5/2, and so on. For 9 neutrons, the first 8 neutrons fill the 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 shells, and the last unpaired neutron goes into the 1d5/2 shell.\n\nThe unpaired neutron in the 1d5/2 shell has an orbital angular momentum (l) of 2 (since d corresponds to l=2) and a spin angular momentum (s) of 1/2 (since it's a fermion). The total angular momentum (j) of the unpaired neutron is the vector sum of l and s, which can be either j = l + s = 5/2 or j = l - s = 3/2.\n\nHowever, experimental data shows that the ground state of 17O has a total angular momentum (I) of 5/2. Therefore, the nuclear spin of Oxygen-17 is 5/2.\n\nTo determine the parity, we need to consider the spatial wave function of the unpaired neutron. The parity of a single-particle state is given by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum. In this case, l=2, so the parity is (-1)^2 = +1. The parity is usually denoted by a plus (+) sign for even values of l (positive parity) and a minus (-) sign for odd values of l (negative parity).\n\nSo, the nuclear spin and parity of Oxygen-17 are 5/2+ (spin 5/2 and positive parity)."
