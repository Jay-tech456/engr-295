    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass increase due to the high velocity of the spaceship, we can use the following formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass (3000 kg), v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\n(0.8c)^2/c^2 = 0.64c^2/c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the denominator of the formula:\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.64) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = 3000 kg / 0.6 = 5000 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is 5000 kg. The relativistic mass increase due to its high velocity is:\n\nÎ”m = m - m0 = 5000 kg - 3000 kg = 2000 kg"
