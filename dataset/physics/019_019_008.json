Show how to calculate the conformal dimension using the operator product expansion (OPE) of the primary operator with itself. How does the central charge of a conformal field theory affect the conformal dimensions of its primary operators?",
    "message_2": "In a 2D conformal field theory (CFT), the conformal dimension of a primary operator is a pair of numbers (h, h̄) that characterize the scaling and transformation properties of the operator under conformal transformations. The conformal dimension is related to the scaling dimension and the spin of the operator.\n\nTo calculate the conformal dimension using the operator product expansion (OPE) of the primary operator with itself, we consider a primary operator O(z, z̄) with conformal dimensions (h, h̄). The OPE of O(z, z̄) with itself can be written as:\n\nO(z, z̄) O(w, w̄) = ∑_i C_i (z-w)^(-hi) (z̄-w̄)^(-h̄i) O_i(w, w̄)\n\nwhere C_i are the OPE coefficients, and O_i(w, w̄) are the descendant operators with conformal dimensions (hi, h̄i).\n\nFor primary operators, the OPE has a singular term when z approaches w:\n\nO(z, z̄) O(w, w̄) ~ (z-w)^(-2h) (z̄-w̄)^(-2h̄) I + ...,\n\nwhere I is the identity operator, and the dots represent less singular or regular terms.\n\nBy comparing the singular terms in the OPE, we can determine the conformal dimensions (h, h̄) of the primary operator O(z, z̄).\n\nThe central charge of a CFT, denoted by c, is a quantity that characterizes the degrees of freedom of the theory and appears in the two-point correlation function of the stress-energy tensor. The central charge affects the conformal dimensions of primary operators through the so-called \"Virasoro algebra\" and its representations.\n\nIn a 2D CFT, the conformal dimensions (h, h̄) of primary operators are related to the central charge through the following equation:\n\nc = 1 - 6(m+1)(m+2)\n\nwhere m is a positive integer. This equation is derived from the minimal model classification of 2D CFTs, which are a special class of CFTs with a finite number of primary operators.\n\nIn general, the central charge provides information about the universality class of the CFT and can be used to constrain the possible values of the conformal dimensions of primary operators. However, it is important to note that the relationship between the central charge and the conformal dimensions of primary operators is not unique, and different CFTs with the same central charge can have different sets of primary operators with different conformal dimensions."
