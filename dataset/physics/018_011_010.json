    "message_2": "The expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos at Earth's surface can be estimated using the power-law energy spectrum. The power-law energy spectrum is given by:\n\nΦ(E) = k * E^(-γ)\n\nwhere Φ(E) is the flux of neutrinos at energy E, k is a constant, and γ is the spectral index. In this case, γ = -2.\n\nTo estimate the flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, we need to integrate the power-law energy spectrum over a specific energy range. For high-energy cosmic neutrinos, we can consider an energy range of 10^6 GeV (1 PeV) to 10^9 GeV (1 EeV).\n\n∫[k * E^(-2)] dE from 10^6 GeV to 10^9 GeV\n\nTo solve the integral, we get:\n\nΦ = [-k * E^(-1)] from 10^6 GeV to 10^9 GeV\n\nΦ = k * (10^6)^(-1) - k * (10^9)^(-1)\n\nNow, we need to determine the constant k. This constant depends on the specific model of the extragalactic neutrino sources and the overall normalization of the neutrino flux. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has measured the high-energy cosmic neutrino flux, and their results can be used to estimate the constant k. According to IceCube's measurements, the normalization constant k is approximately 10^-8 GeV cm^(-2) s^(-1) sr^(-1).\n\nUsing this value for k, we can estimate the expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos at Earth's surface:\n\nΦ = 10^-8 * (10^6)^(-1) - 10^-8 * (10^9)^(-1)\nΦ ≈ 10^-14 GeV cm^(-2) s^(-1) sr^(-1)\n\nSo, the expected flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos at Earth's surface, assuming a primary source of extragalactic origin and a power-law energy spectrum with an index of -2, is approximately 10^-14 GeV cm^(-2) s^(-1) sr^(-1). Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and depends on the specific model of extragalactic neutrino sources and the energy range considered."
