    "message_1": "What is the energy released during a supernova explosion of a star with an initial mass of 25 solar masses? Assume that approximately 10% of the initial mass is converted into energy during the explosion. Calculate the energy released in both joules and in units of solar luminosity.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during a supernova explosion, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's convert the initial mass of the star into kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the initial mass of the star in kilograms is:\n\n25 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 4.9725 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, let's find the mass that is converted into energy during the explosion. We are given that approximately 10% of the initial mass is converted into energy:\n\n0.10 * (4.9725 x 10^31 kg) = 4.9725 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can use the E=mc^2 equation to find the energy released. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s:\n\nE = (4.9725 x 10^30 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 4.475 x 10^47 Joules\n\nNow, let's convert this energy into units of solar luminosity. One solar luminosity is approximately 3.828 x 10^26 Watts. To convert the energy released in Joules to solar luminosity, we need to know the time over which the energy is released. Supernova explosions typically release their energy over a period of about 100 seconds:\n\nEnergy released per second = (4.475 x 10^47 Joules) / (100 s) ≈ 4.475 x 10^45 Joules/s\n\nNow, we can convert this to solar luminosity:\n\n(4.475 x 10^45 Joules/s) / (3.828 x 10^26 Watts/solar luminosity) ≈ 1.169 x 10^19 solar luminosities\n\nSo, the energy released during the supernova explosion of a star with an initial mass of 25 solar masses is approximately 4.475 x 10^47 Joules or 1.169 x 10^19 solar luminosities."
