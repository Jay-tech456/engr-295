    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / π) * √(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and r is the distance between them.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg.\n\nM1 = 20 solar masses = 20 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 3.978 × 10^31 kg\nM2 = 30 solar masses = 30 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 5.967 × 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the black holes from kilometers to meters.\n\nr = 200 km = 200 * 10^3 m = 2 × 10^5 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf = (1 / π) * √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (3.978 × 10^31 kg + 5.967 × 10^31 kg) / (2 × 10^5 m)^3)\n\nf = (1 / π) * √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 × 10^31 kg) / (8 × 10^15 m^3))\n\nf ≈ (1 / π) * √((6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 × 10^31 kg) / (8 × 10^15 m^3))\n\nf ≈ (1 / π) * √(6.639 × 10^16 s^-2)\n\nf ≈ (1 / π) * (8.15 × 10^8 s^-1)\n\nf ≈ 2.59 × 10^8 Hz\n\nThe expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by this binary black hole system is approximately 2.59 × 10^8 Hz or 259 MHz."
