    "message_1": "Suppose you have a wire that carries a current of 2 A and is wrapped around a resistor made of copper wire. The copper wire has a length of 10 cm and a diameter of 2 mm. What is the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the resistor?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the resistor, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current in the wire = 2 A\nr = distance from the center of the wire = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (0.05 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.05\n\nB ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the resistor is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
