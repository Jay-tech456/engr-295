    "message_1": "A student wishes to obtain an erect image of an object using a convex mirror. The distance between the object and the mirror is 15 cm, and the radius of curvature of the mirror is 30 cm. Determine the position, nature, and magnification of the image formed.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula for convex mirrors.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nMagnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf is the focal length of the mirror\nu is the object distance (distance between the object and the mirror)\nv is the image distance (distance between the image and the mirror)\nM is the magnification\n\nFor a convex mirror, the focal length (f) is positive, and the radius of curvature (R) is also positive. The relationship between the focal length and the radius of curvature is:\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 30 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\nf = 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm\n\nNow we have the object distance (u) and the focal length (f):\n\nu = -15 cm (the negative sign indicates that the object is in front of the mirror)\nf = 15 cm\n\nWe can now use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/15 = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 15v:\n\nv = -15v + 15*15\n16v = 225\nv = 225 / 16\nv ≈ 14.06 cm\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive, it means the image is formed behind the mirror, which is a virtual image.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -14.06 / (-15)\nM ≈ 0.94\n\nThe magnification is less than 1, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the convex mirror is virtual, erect, and smaller than the object. The image is located approximately 14.06 cm behind the mirror, and the magnification is approximately 0.94."
