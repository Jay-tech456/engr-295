    "message_2": "The rate of rotation of the Milky Way's central bulge is approximately 100 to 130 kilometers per second. This rotation is primarily due to the gravitational forces acting on the stars, gas, and dust within the bulge, as well as the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*.\n\nThe rotation of the central bulge affects the overall galactic structure and dynamics in several ways:\n\n1. Gravitational influence: The central bulge's mass and rotation create a gravitational force that influences the motion of stars and gas in the surrounding disk of the galaxy. This force helps to maintain the overall spiral structure of the Milky Way.\n\n2. Star formation: The central bulge contains a higher density of stars and gas compared to the outer regions of the galaxy. This increased density leads to more frequent interactions between stars and gas clouds, resulting in a higher rate of star formation in the central regions.\n\n3. Galactic bar: Observations suggest that the Milky Way has a bar-like structure at its center, which is a result of the gravitational interactions between the central bulge and the surrounding disk. This bar can affect the motion of gas and stars in the galaxy, potentially leading to the formation of spiral arms and other galactic features.\n\n4. Galactic evolution: The rotation of the central bulge and its interaction with the surrounding disk can influence the overall evolution of the galaxy. For example, the transfer of angular momentum between the bulge and the disk can cause the galaxy to evolve from a barred spiral to a more regular spiral structure over time.\n\nIn summary, the rate of rotation of the Milky Way's central bulge plays a crucial role in shaping the overall structure, dynamics, and evolution of the galaxy."
