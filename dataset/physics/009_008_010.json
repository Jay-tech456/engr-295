    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 15 cm forms a real and inverted image that is 2 times the size of the object. Determine the object distance from the mirror and the image distance using ray diagrams.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror equation and magnification equation. The mirror equation is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification equation is given by:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nSince the image is real and inverted, and 2 times the size of the object, the magnification M is -2.\n\nNow, we can use these equations to solve for the object distance (do) and image distance (di).\n\nFirst, let's use the magnification equation:\n\n-2 = -di/do\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate di:\n\ndi = 2do\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the mirror equation:\n\n1/15 = 1/do + 1/(2do)\n\nTo solve for do, we can find a common denominator:\n\n1/15 = (2 + 1)/(2do)\n\n1/15 = 3/(2do)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n15 = 6do\n\nDivide by 6:\n\ndo = 15/6 = 2.5 cm\n\nNow that we have the object distance, we can find the image distance using the magnification equation:\n\ndi = 2do = 2(2.5) = 5 cm\n\nSo, the object distance from the mirror is 2.5 cm, and the image distance is 5 cm."
