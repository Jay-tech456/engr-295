    "message_2": "To find the angle of incidence for a polarizing angle (also known as Brewster's angle) in a medium with a refractive index of 1.5, we can use Brewster's Law. Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence (θi) and the angle of refraction (θr) are related by the following equation:\n\ntan(θi) = n\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nIn this case, n = 1.5. To find the angle of incidence, we can take the arctangent of the refractive index:\n\nθi = arctan(1.5)\n\nθi ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of incidence for a polarizing angle in a medium with a refractive index of 1.5 is approximately 56.31 degrees. At this angle, the reflected light will be completely polarized."
