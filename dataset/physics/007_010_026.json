    "message_2": "The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, known as \"Little Boy,\" released an estimated energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT (63 terajoules). This estimation is based on the bomb's design, the amount of fissile material (uranium-235) used, and the efficiency of the nuclear reaction.\n\nThe calculation involves understanding the energy released per fission event and the total number of fission events that occurred. The energy released per fission event is about 200 MeV (million electron volts), which can be converted to joules (1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J). The total number of fission events can be estimated by considering the mass of uranium-235 used in the bomb (about 64 kg) and the efficiency of the nuclear reaction (approximately 1.5%).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of uranium-235 atoms in 64 kg:\nNumber of atoms = (mass of uranium-235) / (molar mass of uranium-235) * Avogadro's number\nNumber of atoms = (64 kg) / (238.03 g/mol) * (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol)\nNumber of atoms ≈ 1.62 x 10^24 atoms\n\nNext, we consider the efficiency of the nuclear reaction (1.5%):\nFission events = 1.5% of 1.62 x 10^24 atoms\nFission events ≈ 2.43 x 10^22 atoms\n\nNow, we calculate the total energy released:\nEnergy = (Energy per fission event) * (Number of fission events)\nEnergy = (200 MeV/atom) * (2.43 x 10^22 atoms) * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nEnergy ≈ 7.8 x 10^13 J\n\nFinally, we convert the energy to kilotons of TNT equivalent:\n1 kiloton of TNT = 4.184 x 10^12 J\nEnergy = (7.8 x 10^13 J) / (4.184 x 10^12 J/kiloton)\nEnergy ≈ 15 kilotons of TNT\n\nSo, the energy released from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 was approximately 15 kilotons of TNT (63 terajoules)."
