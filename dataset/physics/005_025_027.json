    "message_2": "Given the momentum (p) of the electron is 3.0 x 10^-19 kg m/s, we can use the equation E = sqrt((pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2) to find the relativistic energy of the electron. The rest mass of an electron (m) is approximately 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\nE = sqrt(((3.0 x 10^-19 kg m/s)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s))^2 + ((9.11 x 10^-31 kg)(3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2)^2)\n\nE = sqrt((9.0 x 10^-11)^2 + (8.2 x 10^-14)^2)\n\nE = sqrt(8.1 x 10^-21 + 6.7 x 10^-27)\n\nE ≈ sqrt(8.1 x 10^-21)\n\nE ≈ 2.85 x 10^-10 J\n\nThe relativistic energy of the electron with a momentum of 3.0 x 10^-19 kg m/s in free space is approximately 2.85 x 10^-10 Joules."
