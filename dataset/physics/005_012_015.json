    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of a particle, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle (0.6c in this case).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.25 - 1)(5 kg)(c^2)\n\nThe speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging this value into the equation:\n\nK.E. = (0.25)(5 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. = (0.25)(5 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. = 1.25 x 10^17 kg m^2/s^2\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 1.25 x 10^17 Joules."
