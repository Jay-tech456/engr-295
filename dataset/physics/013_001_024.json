    "message_2": "To calculate the size of the accretion disk, we first need to find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole, which is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole (10 solar masses), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). We'll also need to convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms, using the solar mass (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe size of the accretion disk is typically a few times the Schwarzschild radius. For simplicity, let's assume the accretion disk is 3 times the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nAccretion disk size ≈ 3 * Rs ≈ 3 * 2.95 x 10^4 m ≈ 8.85 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the temperature at the innermost radius of the accretion disk. The temperature can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nT = (3 * G * M * Ṁ / (8 * π * σ * R^3))^1/4\n\nwhere T is the temperature, Ṁ is the accretion rate (0.01 solar masses per year), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4), and R is the innermost radius of the accretion disk (which we'll assume to be equal to the Schwarzschild radius, Rs).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the accretion rate to kg/s:\n\nṀ = 0.01 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg/year * (1 year / 3.154 x 10^7 s) ≈ 6.31 x 10^23 kg/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature:\n\nT = (3 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) * (6.31 x 10^23 kg/s) / (8 * π * (5.67 x 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4) * (2.95 x 10^4 m)^3))^1/4\nT ≈ 1.25 x 10^7 K\n\nSo, the size of the accretion disk is approximately 8.85 x 10^4 m, and the temperature at its innermost radius is approximately 1.25 x 10^7 K."
