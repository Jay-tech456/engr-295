    "message_1": "A radioactive isotope has a half-life of 5 minutes. Initially, it contains 4000 nuclei. Calculate the number of nuclei that will remain after 20 minutes.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the remaining number of nuclei after a certain amount of time, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the number of nuclei remaining after time t, N0 is the initial number of nuclei, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life of the isotope.\n\nIn this case, N0 = 4000, t = 20 minutes, and T = 5 minutes. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nN(20) = 4000 * (1/2)^(20/5)\n\nN(20) = 4000 * (1/2)^4\n\nN(20) = 4000 * (1/16)\n\nN(20) = 250\n\nSo, after 20 minutes, there will be 250 nuclei remaining."
