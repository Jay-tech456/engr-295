    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of a specific material depends on the type of material and its electronic properties. In general, there are two main categories of materials when it comes to electrical conductivity: metals and semiconductors.\n\n1. Metals: For most metals, electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature. This is because metals have a lattice structure with free electrons that can move and conduct electricity. As the temperature increases, the lattice vibrations (phonons) also increase, leading to more frequent collisions between the free electrons and the lattice atoms. This increased scattering of electrons results in a decrease in electrical conductivity. This behavior is described by the Bloch-Gr√ºneisen formula.\n\n2. Semiconductors: For semiconductors, the relationship between temperature and electrical conductivity is more complex. At low temperatures, semiconductors behave as insulators, with very low electrical conductivity. As the temperature increases, the number of charge carriers (electrons and holes) increases due to thermal excitation. This leads to an increase in electrical conductivity. However, at even higher temperatures, the increased lattice vibrations (phonons) cause more scattering of the charge carriers, which can then lead to a decrease in conductivity. This behavior can be described by the semiconductor's bandgap and the intrinsic carrier concentration, which are both temperature-dependent.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of a specific material depends on its electronic properties and whether it is a metal or a semiconductor. For metals, conductivity generally decreases with increasing temperature, while for semiconductors, conductivity first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature."
