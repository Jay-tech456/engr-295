    "message_2": "The maximum theoretical efficiency of energy conversion for a black hole accretion disk is given by the Novikov-Thorne efficiency, which depends on the black hole's spin parameter (a dimensionless quantity representing the angular momentum of the black hole).\n\nThe Novikov-Thorne efficiency (η) can be expressed as:\n\nη = 1 - √(1 - (1 - (1 - a²)^(1/2))^2)\n\nwhere 'a' is the spin parameter, ranging from 0 (non-rotating black hole) to 1 (maximally rotating black hole).\n\nFor a non-rotating black hole (a = 0), the efficiency is approximately 5.7% (0.057). For a maximally rotating black hole (a = 1), the efficiency can reach up to 42.3% (0.423).\n\nThe black hole's mass does not directly affect the efficiency of the energy conversion in the accretion disk. However, it does influence the size and structure of the accretion disk, which in turn affects the rate at which matter falls into the black hole and the total energy output. The efficiency remains the same for black holes of different masses, provided their spin parameters are the same."
