    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a disc of radius R carrying a steady current I, given that the point is at a distance z from the center of the disc? Assume the disc is thin and the current is uniformly distributed. Use the formula: \n\nB = (μ/2)*I*(R^2/(R^2+z^2)^(3/2)) \n\nwhere μ is the permeability of free space. Find the value of magnetic field for a disc of radius 0.1 m carrying a current of 2 A, at a point on the axis located 0.1 m from the center of the disc.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the provided formula and plug in the given values for R, I, and z, as well as the permeability of free space (μ), which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nR = 0.1 m\nI = 2 A\nz = 0.1 m\nμ = 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (μ/2) * I * (R^2 / (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A / 2) * (2 A) * (0.1 m^2 / (0.1 m^2 + 0.1 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-7) T·m/A) * (2 A) * (0.01 m^2 / (0.02 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A) * (0.01 m^2 / 0.002828 m^3)\n\nB ≈ 4.468 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the given point on the axis is approximately 4.468 × 10^(-6) T."
