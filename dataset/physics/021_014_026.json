    "message_2": "There are several pieces of evidence that support the hypothesis that quasars are powered by supermassive black holes at their centers:\n\n1. Luminosity and energy output: Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe, with some emitting more than a trillion times the energy of our Sun. This immense energy output is difficult to explain by any other mechanism than accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. As matter falls into the black hole, it forms an accretion disk, which heats up and emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2. Spectral lines and redshifts: The spectra of quasars show broad emission lines, which are indicative of gas moving at high velocities. These high velocities can be explained by the strong gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole. Additionally, the redshifts observed in quasar spectra indicate that they are located at cosmological distances, further supporting the idea that their immense luminosities are powered by black holes.\n\n3. Variability: Quasars exhibit rapid variability in their brightness, sometimes changing significantly over just a few days. This rapid variability suggests that the energy source is compact, as changes in brightness would take longer to propagate through a larger object. A supermassive black hole provides a compact energy source that can explain this rapid variability.\n\n4. Radio emissions and jets: Many quasars emit strong radio waves and have been observed to produce relativistic jets of plasma. These jets are thought to be powered by the release of gravitational energy as matter falls into the black hole and interacts with its magnetic field. The presence of these jets supports the idea that quasars are powered by supermassive black holes.\n\n5. Host galaxies and black hole mass: Observations of quasar host galaxies have shown that the mass of the central black hole is correlated with the mass of the host galaxy's bulge. This correlation suggests a connection between the growth of the black hole and the growth of the galaxy, supporting the idea that quasars are powered by supermassive black holes at their centers.\n\n6. Gravitational lensing: In some cases, the light from a distant quasar is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy, producing multiple images of the quasar. The analysis of these lensing events has provided further evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes at the centers of quasars.\n\nIn summary, the immense luminosity, spectral features, variability, radio emissions, host galaxy properties, and gravitational lensing observations all provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that quasars are powered by supermassive black holes at their centers."
