    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of each gas in the mixture, we will first need to find the partial pressures of nitrogen and hydrogen at the final conditions (1.5 atm and 100°C). Then, we will use the van der Waals equation of state to find the fugacity coefficients for each gas. Finally, we will multiply the fugacity coefficients by the partial pressures to find the fugacities.\n\n1. Calculate the partial pressures of nitrogen and hydrogen at the final conditions:\n\nThe mole fractions of nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) are given as 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. The total pressure is 1.5 atm. Therefore, the partial pressures of N2 and H2 are:\n\nP_N2 = 0.6 * 1.5 atm = 0.9 atm\nP_H2 = 0.4 * 1.5 atm = 0.6 atm\n\n2. Use the van der Waals equation of state to find the fugacity coefficients:\n\nThe van der Waals equation of state is given by:\n\n(P + a * (n/V)^2) * (V/n - b) = R * T\n\nwhere P is the pressure, n is the number of moles, V is the volume, T is the temperature, R is the gas constant, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nFor nitrogen (N2), the van der Waals constants are:\na_N2 = 1.39 L²atm/mol²\nb_N2 = 0.0391 L/mol\n\nFor hydrogen (H2), the van der Waals constants are:\na_H2 = 0.244 L²atm/mol²\nb_H2 = 0.0266 L/mol\n\nWe can rewrite the van der Waals equation in terms of the compressibility factor (Z):\n\nZ = (P * V) / (n * R * T)\n\nFor a gas mixture, the fugacity coefficient (phi) can be calculated using the following relation:\n\nphi_i = exp[(Z - 1) - ln(Z - B) - A/(2 * sqrt(2) * B) * ln((Z + (1 + sqrt(2)) * B)/(Z + (1 - sqrt(2)) * B))]\n\nwhere A and B are the dimensionless van der Waals constants for the mixture, which can be calculated using the following relations:\n\nA = (a * P) / (R * T)^2\nB = (b * P) / (R * T)\n\n3. Calculate the fugacity coefficients for nitrogen and hydrogen:\n\nUsing the van der Waals constants and the partial pressures calculated in step 1, we can calculate the dimensionless van der Waals constants A and B for both nitrogen and hydrogen:\n\nA_N2 = (1.39 * 0.9) / (0.0821 * 373)^2 = 0.0362\nB_N2 = (0.0391 * 0.9) / (0.0821 * 373) = 0.0014\n\nA_H2 = (0.244 * 0.6) / (0.0821 * 373)^2 = 0.0064\nB_H2 = (0.0266 * 0.6) / (0.0821 * 373) = 0.0006\n\nNow, we can calculate the compressibility factor (Z) for both gases using the van der Waals equation of state. For simplicity, we will assume that Z is approximately equal to 1 for both gases:\n\nZ_N2 ≈ 1\nZ_H2 ≈ 1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity coefficients (phi) for nitrogen and hydrogen using the relation given in step 2:\n\nphi_N2 = exp[(1 - 1) - ln(1 - 0.0014) - 0.0362/(2 * sqrt(2) * 0.0014) * ln((1 + (1 + sqrt(2)) * 0.0014)/(1 + (1 - sqrt(2)) * 0.0014))] ≈ 0.988\n\nphi_H2 = exp[(1 - 1) - ln(1 - 0.0006) - 0.0064/(2 * sqrt(2) * 0.0006) * ln((1 + (1 + sqrt(2)) * 0.0006)/(1 + (1 - sqrt(2)) * 0.0006))] ≈ 0.993\n\n4. Calculate the fugacities of nitrogen and hydrogen:\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacities (f) of nitrogen and hydrogen by multiplying the fugacity coefficients by the partial pressures:\n\nf_N2 = phi_N2 * P_N2 = 0.988 * 0.9 atm ≈ 0.889 atm\nf_H2 = phi_H2 * P_H2 = 0.993 * 0.6 atm ≈ 0.596 atm\n\nSo, the fugacity of nitrogen in the mixture is approximately 0.889 atm, and the fugacity of hydrogen is approximately 0.596 atm."
