    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm (focal length)\nu = -10 cm (object distance; negative since the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/f - 1/u\n1/v = 1/15 - 1/(-10)\n1/v = (10 + 15) / (15 * 10)\n1/v = 25 / 150\nv = 150 / 25\nv = 6 cm\n\nThe image is formed 6 cm in front of the mirror (since v is positive).\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nm = -6 / (-10)\nm = 0.6\n\nThe magnification is 0.6, which means the image is 0.6 times the size of the object. If you need the size of the image, you would need to know the size of the object and multiply it by the magnification factor."
