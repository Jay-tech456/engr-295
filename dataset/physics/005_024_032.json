    "message_2": "To determine the age of the universe, we can use the Hubble's Law, which states that the expansion rate (Hubble constant, H0) is related to the age of the universe. The formula to calculate the age of the universe is:\n\nAge of the universe = 1 / H0\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Hubble constant (H0) from km/s/Mpc to a more convenient unit, such as s^-1 (inverse seconds). We know that:\n\n1 Mpc = 3.086 × 10^19 km\n1 light-year = 9.461 × 10^12 km\n1 year = 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds\n\nNow, we can convert 72 km/s/Mpc to s^-1:\n\n72 km/s/Mpc × (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 km) = 2.335 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the age of the universe:\n\nAge of the universe = 1 / (2.335 × 10^-18 s^-1) = 4.281 × 10^17 seconds\n\nTo convert this value to years, we can use the conversion factor for seconds to years:\n\nAge of the universe = 4.281 × 10^17 seconds × (1 year / 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds) ≈ 13.58 billion years\n\nSo, according to the given expansion rate and the principles of relativistic cosmology, the age of the universe is approximately 13.58 billion years."
