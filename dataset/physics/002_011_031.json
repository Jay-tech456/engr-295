    "message_2": "To calculate the adiabatic work done in the process, we need to use the adiabatic equation for work:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nwhere W is the work done, P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume, and γ is the heat capacity ratio.\n\nWe are given the initial volume V1 = 5 L, final volume V2 = 20 L, and constant pressure P = 2 atm. We also know that γ = 1.4.\n\nSince the process is adiabatic, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, and the internal energy change is equal to the work done. Therefore, we can use the ideal gas law to find the final pressure P2:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n2 * (5)^1.4 = P2 * (20)^1.4\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = (2 * (5)^1.4) / (20)^1.4\nP2 ≈ 0.3205 atm\n\nNow we can calculate the adiabatic work done:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\nW = (2 * 5 - 0.3205 * 20) / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ (10 - 6.41) / 0.4\nW ≈ 3.59 / 0.4\nW ≈ 8.975 J\n\nSo, the adiabatic work done in the process is approximately 8.975 Joules."
