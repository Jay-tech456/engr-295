    "message_2": "To calculate the average energy and temperature of particles in the expanding blast wave of a Type II supernova explosion, we need to consider the energy conservation and the adiabatic expansion of the blast wave. We will make some simplifying assumptions to make the problem tractable.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The blast wave expands spherically symmetrically.\n2. The density of the surrounding medium is constant.\n3. The blast wave expands adiabatically, meaning there is no heat transfer between the blast wave and the surrounding medium.\n\nGiven:\nInitial energy of the explosion, E = 10^45 Joules\nTime elapsed since the explosion, t = 1 year\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the blast wave at time t. The Sedov-Taylor solution for the blast wave radius R(t) is given by:\n\nR(t) = (E * t^2 / ρ)^(1/5)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the surrounding medium. For a typical interstellar medium, ρ ≈ 10^-24 kg/m^3.\n\nR(t) = ((10^45 J) * (1 year)^2 / (10^-24 kg/m^3))^(1/5)\nR(t) ≈ 4.2 * 10^18 m\n\nNow, let's find the average energy per particle in the blast wave. We will assume that the blast wave consists of fully ionized hydrogen, so each particle is a proton with mass mp ≈ 1.67 * 10^-27 kg.\n\nThe total mass of the blast wave, M, can be estimated as:\n\nM = (4/3) * π * R(t)^3 * ρ\nM ≈ 1.4 * 10^34 kg\n\nThe total number of particles, N, in the blast wave is:\n\nN = M / mp\nN ≈ 8.4 * 10^60\n\nThe average energy per particle, ε, is:\n\nε = E / N\nε ≈ 1.19 * 10^-16 J\n\nNow, let's find the temperature of the particles in the blast wave. We will use the equipartition theorem, which states that the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom is (1/2) * k * T, where k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 * 10^-23 J/K).\n\nFor a monoatomic gas like fully ionized hydrogen, there are 3 degrees of freedom (one for each spatial dimension). Therefore, the average kinetic energy per particle is (3/2) * k * T.\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = (2/3) * (ε / k)\nT ≈ (2/3) * (1.19 * 10^-16 J / 1.38 * 10^-23 J/K)\nT ≈ 5.7 * 10^6 K\n\nSo, the average energy of particles in the expanding blast wave of a Type II supernova explosion after one year is approximately 1.19 * 10^-16 J, and the temperature is approximately 5.7 * 10^6 K."
