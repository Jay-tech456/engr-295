    "message_1": "A light ray is travelling in a medium with an index of refraction n1 and hits a boundary with a medium of index of refraction n2. What should be the critical angle between these two mediums to achieve a total internal reflection? Provide the numerical value of the critical angle when n1 = 1.5 and n2 = 1.0.",
    "message_2": "To achieve total internal reflection, the critical angle (θc) can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nGiven n1 = 1.5 and n2 = 1.0, we can calculate the critical angle:\n\nsin(θc) = 1.0 / 1.5\nsin(θc) = 2/3\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse sine (arcsin) of 2/3 to get the critical angle:\n\nθc = arcsin(2/3)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle between the two mediums to achieve total internal reflection is approximately 41.81°."
