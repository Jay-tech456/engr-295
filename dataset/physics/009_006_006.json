    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 15 cm and object distance u = -20 cm (negative because the object is in front of the mirror), we can solve for the image distance v:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying through by -60v to eliminate fractions:\n\n-4v = 3v + 60\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n7v = 60\n\nDividing by 7:\n\nv = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 cm\n\nThe image distance is positive, meaning the image is formed on the same side as the object, so it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's determine the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nm = -8.57 / (-20)\n\nm ≈ 0.43\n\nSince the magnification is less than 1, the image is diminished. The negative sign in the magnification formula indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is at approximately 8.57 cm from the mirror, it is real, inverted, and diminished."
