    "message_2": "To find the activity coefficient of ethanol in the solution, we can use the following equation:\n\nγ = (P_solution / P_pure) * (x_water / x_ethanol)\n\nwhere γ is the activity coefficient, P_solution is the vapor pressure of the solution, P_pure is the vapor pressure of pure ethanol, x_water is the mole fraction of water, and x_ethanol is the mole fraction of ethanol.\n\nFirst, let's find the mole fractions of ethanol and water in the solution:\n\nx_ethanol = moles of ethanol / total moles\nx_ethanol = 0.1 / (0.1 + 0.9)\nx_ethanol = 0.1\n\nx_water = moles of water / total moles\nx_water = 0.9 / (0.1 + 0.9)\nx_water = 0.9\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation to find the activity coefficient:\n\nγ = (22.8 mmHg / 45.9 mmHg) * (0.9 / 0.1)\nγ = 0.4963 * 9\nγ ≈ 4.47\n\nThe activity coefficient of ethanol in the solution is approximately 4.47."
