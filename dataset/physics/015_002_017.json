    "message_2": "The frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger can be determined using the data collected by gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO through a process called matched filtering. Here's an outline of the steps involved in this process:\n\n1. Data collection: Gravitational wave observatories like LIGO use highly sensitive laser interferometers to detect tiny distortions in spacetime caused by passing gravitational waves. When a neutron star merger occurs, it emits gravitational waves that travel through space and eventually reach Earth, causing minute changes in the distance between the mirrors in the interferometers. These changes are recorded as a time series of data.\n\n2. Template bank: Scientists create a large set of theoretical templates representing the expected gravitational wave signals from various types of astrophysical events, including neutron star mergers. These templates are generated using numerical simulations and general relativity equations, taking into account the masses, spins, and other properties of the merging objects.\n\n3. Matched filtering: The recorded data is then cross-correlated with the template bank to find the best match. This involves sliding each template over the data and calculating the correlation coefficient at each time step. The template that produces the highest correlation is considered the best match, and its parameters provide an estimate of the properties of the source, including the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\n4. Signal processing and noise reduction: The raw data collected by gravitational wave observatories contain a significant amount of noise from various sources, such as seismic activity, thermal fluctuations, and instrumental artifacts. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, various signal processing techniques are applied, including filtering, windowing, and whitening.\n\n5. Parameter estimation: Once the best match is found, the parameters of the template, such as the masses and spins of the merging neutron stars, can be used to estimate the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. The frequency of the waves evolves over time, starting at a lower frequency and increasing as the neutron stars spiral closer together. The frequency reaches its peak just before the merger, and this peak frequency is directly related to the properties of the merging objects.\n\n6. Verification and statistical analysis: To ensure the reliability of the detected signal, scientists perform various consistency checks and statistical analyses. They also compare the results from multiple observatories to confirm the detection and improve the accuracy of the estimated parameters.\n\nBy following these steps, physicists can determine the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger using the data collected by gravitational wave observatories like LIGO."
