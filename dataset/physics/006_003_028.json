    "message_2": "When an external magnetic field is applied to alkali metals like sodium and potassium, it affects the spectral lines of these elements by causing a splitting of the energy levels. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect. The energy levels of the electrons in the atoms are quantized, and the presence of a magnetic field causes these levels to split into multiple sublevels, leading to a broadening of the spectral lines.\n\nThe Zeeman effect can be used to calculate the magnetic moment of the atoms in the presence of the magnetic field. To do this, we need to consider the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the atom. The magnetic moment (μ) of an atom is related to its angular momentum (L) and the gyromagnetic ratio (g) as follows:\n\nμ = g * (e / 2m) * L\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, and m is the electron mass.\n\nThe energy associated with the interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field (B) is given by:\n\nΔE = -μ * B * cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.\n\nIn the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split into 2L + 1 sublevels, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The splitting of the energy levels can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔE = m_l * g * (e * B / 2m)\n\nwhere m_l is the magnetic quantum number, which ranges from -L to +L.\n\nBy measuring the splitting of the spectral lines and knowing the strength of the applied magnetic field, we can calculate the magnetic moment of the atoms in the presence of the magnetic field using the Zeeman effect. This information can be useful in understanding the electronic structure of the atoms and their behavior in different environments."
