    "message_2": "Theoretically and experimentally detecting dark matter involves a combination of indirect observations, direct detection experiments, and particle collider experiments. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, it is believed to interact with visible matter through gravitational forces. Here are some methods to detect dark matter and infer its properties:\n\n1. Indirect observations: Astronomers and physicists study the motion of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation to infer the presence of dark matter. Observations of gravitational lensing, where light from distant objects is bent by the gravitational pull of massive objects, can also provide evidence for dark matter.\n\nProperties inferred: The distribution and mass of dark matter can be inferred from these observations, as well as its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n2. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), by observing their interactions with ordinary matter. Direct detection experiments, like the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the XENON1T experiment, use highly sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation.\n\nProperties inferred: If dark matter particles are detected, their mass, interaction cross-section, and other properties can be inferred from the observed signals.\n\n3. Particle collider experiments: Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially create dark matter particles by smashing protons together at high energies. If dark matter particles are produced in these collisions, they would escape the detector unseen, but their presence could be inferred from the energy and momentum conservation laws.\n\nProperties inferred: If dark matter particles are created and detected in collider experiments, their mass, interaction properties, and decay channels can be inferred from the observed data.\n\nIn summary, detecting dark matter involves a combination of indirect observations, direct detection experiments, and particle collider experiments. By studying its interactions with visible matter, we can infer properties such as its distribution, mass, interaction cross-section, and role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures."
