    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to draw a ray diagram for an object placed 20cm away from a converging lens of focal length 10cm. Determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the lens.",
    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm (converging lens)\nu = -20 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/v - 1/(-20)\n1/10 + 1/20 = 1/v\n(2 + 1)/20 = 1/v\n3/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (v):\n\nv = 20/3 cm\nv = 6.67 cm (positive, which means the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens)\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -6.67 / (-20)\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the lens is:\n1. Positioned 6.67 cm away from the lens on the opposite side.\n2. 1/3 the size of the object.\n3. Upright and virtual in nature."
