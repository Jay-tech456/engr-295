    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at a speed of 0.8c is emitting a radio signal at a frequency of 10 GHz. If an observer on Earth measures the frequency of the signal to be 2.5 GHz, what is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for frequency:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed on Earth, f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship, v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the Earth (in units of c, the speed of light), and sqrt denotes the square root.\n\nWe are given f_observed = 2.5 GHz, f_emitted = 10 GHz, and we want to find v.\n\n2.5 GHz = 10 GHz * sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\nDivide both sides by 10 GHz:\n\n0.25 = sqrt((1 - v) / (1 + v))\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n0.0625 = (1 - v) / (1 + v)\n\nNow, solve for v:\n\n0.0625 * (1 + v) = 1 - v\n\n0.0625 + 0.0625v = 1 - v\n\n1.0625v = 1 - 0.0625\n\nv = (1 - 0.0625) / 1.0625\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.883\n\nSo, the relative velocity between the spaceship and the Earth is approximately 0.883c."
