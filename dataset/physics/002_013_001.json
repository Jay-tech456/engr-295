    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures of 500 K and 300 K respectively. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of this engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine operating between two reservoirs at different temperatures. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 500 K.\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K)\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - 0.6\nCarnot efficiency = 0.4\n\nThe Carnot efficiency of this heat engine is 0.4 or 40%."
