    "message_1": "What is the critical pressure of a substance with a critical temperature of 400 K, a critical volume of 0.1 m3/mol, and a van der Waals constant a of 10 J·m3/mol2 and a constant b of 0.1×10-2 m3/mol? Round your answer to two significant figures.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical pressure of a substance, we can use the van der Waals equation for real gases at the critical point:\n\nPc = (a / (27 * b^2)) - (R * Tc / (3 * b))\n\nwhere Pc is the critical pressure, a and b are the van der Waals constants, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹), and Tc is the critical temperature.\n\nGiven the values:\nTc = 400 K\na = 10 J·m³/mol²\nb = 0.1 × 10⁻² m³/mol\n\nWe can now plug these values into the equation:\n\nPc = (10 / (27 * (0.1 × 10⁻²)²)) - (8.314 * 400 / (3 * (0.1 × 10⁻²)))\n\nPc = (10 / (27 * (0.001)²)) - (3325.6 / (0.003))\n\nPc = (10 / 0.00027) - (3325.6 / 0.003)\n\nPc ≈ 37037 - 1108533\n\nPc ≈ -1072496 Pa\n\nHowever, the result is negative which is not physically meaningful for pressure. There might be an error in the given values or the problem statement. Please check the values and try again."
