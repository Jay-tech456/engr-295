    "message_2": "The cochlea is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear that plays a crucial role in the perception of sound. The shape of the cochlea and its internal structures affect the perception of different frequencies of sound waves in several ways.\n\n1. Tonotopic organization: The cochlea is tonotopically organized, meaning that different regions of the cochlea are responsible for detecting different frequencies of sound. The base of the cochlea, near the oval window, is more rigid and narrow, making it more sensitive to high-frequency sounds. In contrast, the apex of the cochlea is wider and more flexible, making it more sensitive to low-frequency sounds. This organization allows the cochlea to separate and process a wide range of frequencies.\n\n2. Basilar membrane: The basilar membrane is a thin, elastic structure that runs along the length of the cochlea. It plays a critical role in the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. The stiffness and width of the basilar membrane vary along its length, with the base being stiffer and narrower than the apex. When sound waves enter the cochlea, they cause the basilar membrane to vibrate. The varying stiffness and width of the basilar membrane cause it to resonate at different frequencies along its length, with high frequencies causing maximum displacement near the base and low frequencies causing maximum displacement near the apex.\n\n3. Hair cells and frequency tuning: The hair cells are the sensory receptors in the cochlea that convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. They are arranged along the length of the basilar membrane and are tuned to specific frequencies based on their location. When the basilar membrane vibrates, the hair cells in the region of maximum displacement are stimulated, sending electrical signals to the auditory nerve and ultimately to the brain for processing. This frequency-specific stimulation of hair cells allows the brain to perceive different frequencies of sound.\n\nIn summary, the shape of the cochlea and its internal structures, such as the tonotopic organization, the basilar membrane, and the hair cells, play a crucial role in the perception of different frequencies of sound waves. The cochlea's spiral shape and varying properties along its length allow it to separate and process a wide range of frequencies, enabling humans to perceive a diverse range of sounds."
