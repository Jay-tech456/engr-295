    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a theoretical process by which black holes can lose mass and energy due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who first proposed it in 1974. The relationship between Hawking radiation and the thermodynamic properties of a black hole, such as its temperature and entropy, can be understood through the concept of black hole thermodynamics.\n\n1. Black hole temperature: The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. This is described by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (hbar * c^3) / (8 * pi * G * M * k)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k is the Boltzmann constant. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses mass, which in turn increases its temperature. This means that smaller black holes are hotter than larger ones.\n\n2. Black hole entropy: The entropy of a black hole is a measure of the amount of information or disorder associated with it. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula relates the entropy of a black hole to its surface area:\n\nS = (kc^3 * A) / (4 * hbar * G)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and the other constants are the same as in the temperature formula. The surface area of the event horizon is proportional to the square of the black hole's mass, so as a black hole loses mass due to Hawking radiation, its entropy decreases.\n\nIn summary, Hawking radiation provides a connection between the thermodynamic properties of a black hole and its quantum behavior. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses mass, which leads to an increase in its temperature and a decrease in its entropy. This process continues until the black hole eventually evaporates completely, leaving behind only the radiation it emitted."
