    "message_2": "To calculate the diffusion coefficient (D) of glucose through a cell membrane, we can use the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = kT / (6πηr)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310 K)\n- η is the dynamic viscosity of the medium (for cell membrane, we can approximate it to the viscosity of water, which is around 0.001 Pa·s at 37°C)\n- r is the radius of the glucose molecule (approximated to be around 0.5 nm)\n\nFirst, let's convert the radius of the glucose molecule to meters:\n\nr = 0.5 nm = 0.5 × 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K × 310 K) / (6π × 0.001 Pa·s × 0.5 × 10^-9 m)\n\nD ≈ 4.34 × 10^-12 m²/s\n\nSo, the diffusion coefficient of a glucose molecule through a cell membrane with a thickness of 8 nanometers at a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius is approximately 4.34 × 10^-12 m²/s. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimation, as the actual diffusion coefficient can be influenced by various factors such as membrane composition and the presence of transport proteins."
