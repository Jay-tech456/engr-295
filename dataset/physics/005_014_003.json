    "message_1": "A subatomic particle travels at a speed of 0.95c before it decays into two smaller particles. If one of the resulting particles has a mass of 2.5×10^-27 kg and the other has a mass of 1.8×10^-27 kg, what was the rest mass of the original particle? (Hint: Use conservation of momentum and energy in the relativistic context of the problem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of momentum and energy in the relativistic context. Let's denote the original particle as A, and the two resulting particles as B and C. The rest mass of the original particle will be denoted as m_A.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conservation of momentum. In the relativistic context, the momentum of a particle is given by:\n\np = γmv\n\nwhere p is the momentum, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and v is the velocity of the particle. The Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nSince the original particle A decays into particles B and C, the total momentum before the decay must be equal to the total momentum after the decay:\n\np_A = p_B + p_C\n\nNow let's consider the conservation of energy. In the relativistic context, the energy of a particle is given by:\n\nE = γmc^2\n\nThe total energy before the decay must be equal to the total energy after the decay:\n\nE_A = E_B + E_C\n\nWe can rewrite the energy equation in terms of momentum:\n\nE_A^2 = (p_Ac)^2 + (m_Ac^2)^2\n\nNow we can substitute the momentum equation into the energy equation:\n\nE_A^2 = (p_Bc + p_Cc)^2 + (m_Ac^2)^2\n\nWe know the masses and velocities of particles B and C, so we can calculate their momenta and energies. Then, we can solve the above equation for the rest mass of the original particle, m_A.\n\nLet's calculate the Lorentz factors for particles B and C:\n\nγ_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_B/c)^2)\nγ_C = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_C/c)^2)\n\nNow we can calculate the momenta and energies for particles B and C:\n\np_B = γ_B * m_B * v_B\np_C = γ_C * m_C * v_C\n\nE_B = γ_B * m_B * c^2\nE_C = γ_C * m_C * c^2\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the energy equation and solve for m_A:\n\nE_A^2 = (p_Bc + p_Cc)^2 + (m_Ac^2)^2\n\nm_A = sqrt((E_A^2 - (p_Bc + p_Cc)^2) / c^4)\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for the velocities of particles B and C after the decay, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the rest mass of the original particle. However, the above equation can be used to solve for m_A once the velocities of particles B and C are known."
