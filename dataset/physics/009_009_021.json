    "message_2": "To find the magnification produced by a converging lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 10 cm and the object distance u = 20 cm, we can solve for the image distance v:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20v:\n\n2v = v + 20\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (M) = -v/u\n\nM = -20/20\n\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification produced by the converging lens is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
