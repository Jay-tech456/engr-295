    "message_1": "A Physics student wants to study the Compton effect in an aluminum atom. Given the wavelength of the incident photon is 0.1 nm, what is the energy of the scattered photon at an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the incident photon?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h / (m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given wavelength from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(60°))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.738 x 10^-22 kg m/s) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ = 0.121 x 10^-12 m\n\nThe wavelength of the scattered photon is:\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ\nλ' = 0.1 x 10^-9 m + 0.121 x 10^-12 m\nλ' = 0.100121 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the scattered photon using the formula:\n\nE = (h * c) / λ'\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.100121 x 10^-9 m)\nE = 1.986 x 10^-16 J\n\nSo, the energy of the scattered photon at an angle of 60 degrees with respect to the incident photon is approximately 1.986 x 10^-16 J."
