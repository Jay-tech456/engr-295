    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a current flowing through a straight wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, for a more straightforward calculation, we can use Ampere's Law in the form of the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 4 A and the distance r = 3 cm = 0.03 m, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.06 m)\n\nB ≈ 2.13 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a current of 4 A flowing through a wire of length 0.5 m at a distance of 3 cm away from the wire is approximately 2.13 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
