    "message_2": "The level of cosmic ray background radiation on the International Space Station (ISS) is significantly higher than on Earth's surface due to the lack of protection from Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. On average, the ISS receives a dose rate of about 150-200 millisieverts (mSv) per year, which is about 300-400 times higher than the dose rate experienced at sea level on Earth (approximately 0.5 mSv per year).\n\nProlonged exposure to cosmic rays poses several health risks to astronauts, including:\n\n1. Increased risk of cancer: Cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles that can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer. The lifetime risk of cancer increases by about 5% for every 100 mSv of radiation exposure.\n\n2. Central nervous system effects: High-energy particles can cause damage to the nervous system, potentially leading to cognitive impairments, memory loss, and mood changes.\n\n3. Cataracts: Exposure to cosmic rays can increase the risk of developing cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision.\n\n4. Cardiovascular diseases: Some studies suggest that radiation exposure may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, although more research is needed to confirm this association.\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with prolonged exposure to cosmic rays, several measures can be implemented:\n\n1. Shielding: Using materials with high hydrogen content, such as water or polyethylene, can provide effective shielding against cosmic rays. These materials can be incorporated into the walls of the spacecraft or used to create a dedicated \"safe room\" for astronauts during periods of high radiation exposure.\n\n2. Limiting mission duration: By limiting the duration of space missions, the overall exposure to cosmic rays can be reduced. This is particularly important for missions beyond low Earth orbit, where radiation levels are even higher.\n\n3. Personal dosimetry: Monitoring individual radiation exposure using personal dosimeters can help ensure that astronauts do not exceed established dose limits.\n\n4. Medical countermeasures: Research is ongoing to develop pharmaceutical countermeasures that can mitigate the effects of radiation exposure, such as drugs that can reduce inflammation and promote DNA repair.\n\n5. Earth's magnetic field exploitation: Designing spacecraft trajectories that take advantage of Earth's magnetic field to provide additional shielding against cosmic rays can help reduce radiation exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, the level of cosmic ray background radiation on the ISS poses significant health risks to astronauts. However, by implementing appropriate shielding, limiting mission duration, monitoring radiation exposure, and researching medical countermeasures, these risks can be mitigated to ensure the safety and well-being of astronauts during their missions."
