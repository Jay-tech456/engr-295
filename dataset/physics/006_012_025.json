    "message_2": "The ionization energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from its current energy level to an infinitely separated state (n = âˆž). Since the energy of the electron in the ground state is -13.6 eV, the ionization energy required to remove the electron is the absolute value of this energy:\n\nIonization energy = |-13.6 eV| = 13.6 eV"
