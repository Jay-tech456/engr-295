    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the ray of light travels from water (n1 = 1.33) into air (n2 = 1.00), and the incident angle is 60 degrees (θ1 = 60°). We want to find the angle of refraction (θ2).\n\n1.33 * sin(60°) = 1.00 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60°) = 0.866, so:\n\n1.33 * 0.866 = sin(θ2)\n\n1.152 = sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse sine (arcsin) of 1.152 to get θ2. However, the sine function has a maximum value of 1, so there is no real solution for this problem. This means that the ray of light does not refract into the air but instead undergoes total internal reflection within the water."
