If the initial and final temperatures are 20°C and 100°C respectively, calculate the latent heat of vaporization of water.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of vaporization of water, we need to determine the amount of heat energy required to change the water from liquid to steam. We can do this by using the following formula:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy, m is the mass of the water, and L is the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat energy required to raise the temperature of the water from 20°C to 100°C. We can do this using the specific heat capacity formula:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q1 is the heat energy, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4.18 J/g°C. The mass of the water is 200 grams, and the change in temperature is (100 - 20)°C = 80°C.\n\nQ1 = (200 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(80°C) = 66880 J\n\nNow, we need to find the heat energy required to change the water from liquid to steam at 100°C. This is the heat energy we're interested in, as it will help us determine the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nWe know that Q = mL, so we can rearrange the formula to find L:\n\nL = Q/m\n\nWe have the mass of the water (200 g) and the heat energy required to change it from liquid to steam (Q). However, we don't have the value for Q yet. To find Q, we need to use the heat of vaporization of water, which is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol at 100°C and 1 atmosphere.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water to moles. The molar mass of water is approximately 18 g/mol:\n\nmoles of water = (200 g) / (18 g/mol) = 11.11 mol\n\nNow, we can find the heat energy required to change the water from liquid to steam:\n\nQ = (11.11 mol)(40.7 kJ/mol) = 452.177 kJ\n\nSince we want the answer in joules, we need to convert kJ to J:\n\nQ = 452.177 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = 452177 J\n\nNow, we can find the latent heat of vaporization using the formula L = Q/m:\n\nL = (452177 J) / (200 g) = 2260.885 J/g\n\nThe latent heat of vaporization of water is approximately 2260.885 J/g."
