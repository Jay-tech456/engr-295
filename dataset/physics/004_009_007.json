    "message_2": "In General Relativity, the Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime around a rotating black hole. The spin of a black hole is characterized by a dimensionless parameter 'a', which is the ratio of the black hole's angular momentum (J) to its mass (M) times the speed of light (c): a = J/(Mc). The parameter 'a' ranges from 0 (non-rotating, Schwarzschild black hole) to 1 (extremal, maximally rotating black hole).\n\nThe event horizon of a Kerr black hole is tilted with respect to its rotation axis due to frame-dragging, an effect in which the black hole's rotation drags the surrounding spacetime along with it. The angle of tilt depends on the spin parameter 'a' and the radial coordinate 'r' of the event horizon.\n\nThe radial coordinate of the event horizon in the Kerr metric is given by:\n\nr_+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - a^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe angle of tilt of the event horizon with respect to the rotation axis can be described in terms of the latitude angle θ. The tilt is maximal at the equator (θ = π/2) and vanishes at the poles (θ = 0, π). The relationship between the spin parameter 'a', the radial coordinate 'r', and the latitude angle θ is given by:\n\ncos(θ) = sqrt(1 - a^2/r^2)\n\nAs the spin parameter 'a' increases, the event horizon becomes more tilted with respect to the rotation axis. In the case of a non-rotating black hole (a = 0), the event horizon is not tilted at all, while for a maximally rotating black hole (a = 1), the event horizon is maximally tilted."
