    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular inductor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current (2 A),\nN is the number of turns (100),\nR is the radius of the inductor (0.1 m), and\nx is the distance from the center of the loop (0 m, since we are looking for the magnetic field at the center).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 100 * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0.1 m² + 0²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 100 * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-5) T) / (2 * 0.01 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-5) T) / 0.01 m\n\nB = 4π × 10^(-4) T\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular inductor is approximately 1.2566 × 10^(-3) T or 1.2566 mT."
