    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor is a material property and is not affected by the thickness of the film. For YBa2Cu3O7-x, the critical temperature is typically around 90 K (kelvin) or -183 Â°C. This value can vary slightly depending on the specific composition (the value of x) and the quality of the sample, but the thickness of the film will not significantly change the critical temperature."
