    "message_2": "Quantum teleportation relies on the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which allows for the instantaneous transfer of quantum information between two entangled particles, regardless of the distance between them. However, in practice, there are several factors that limit the maximum distance at which quantum teleportation can be achieved.\n\nThe current record for quantum teleportation is approximately 1,400 kilometers (870 miles), which was achieved in 2017 by a team of Chinese researchers using the Micius satellite. This experiment involved the transmission of entangled photons between the satellite and ground stations on Earth.\n\nThe main limitations in achieving long-distance quantum teleportation are:\n\n1. Transmission losses: As the distance between the entangled particles increases, the probability of successful transmission decreases due to factors such as absorption and scattering in the transmission medium (e.g., optical fibers or free space).\n\n2. Decoherence: Quantum entanglement is a fragile phenomenon, and the entangled state can be easily disrupted by interactions with the environment, such as thermal fluctuations or stray electromagnetic fields. This process, called decoherence, can limit the preservation of entanglement over long distances.\n\n3. Detection efficiency: The efficiency of single-photon detectors used in quantum teleportation experiments is not perfect, which can further reduce the probability of successful transmission.\n\n4. Quantum repeaters: To overcome the limitations of transmission losses and decoherence, researchers are developing quantum repeaters, which can extend the range of quantum communication by entangling and teleporting quantum states across intermediate nodes. However, practical implementation of quantum repeaters is still in the early stages of development.\n\nIn summary, the current maximum distance for quantum teleportation is around 1,400 kilometers, achieved using satellite-based experiments. However, this distance is likely to increase in the future as researchers continue to develop new technologies and techniques to overcome the limitations of quantum communication and entanglement preservation."
