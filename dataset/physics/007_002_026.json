    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has an initial mass of 1 gram and a half-life of 10 days. After 30 days, what will be the mass of the sample?",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of the radioactive material after 30 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 1 gram, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 1 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\nFinal mass = 1 * (1/2)^3\nFinal mass = 1 * (1/8)\nFinal mass = 0.125 grams\n\nAfter 30 days, the mass of the radioactive sample will be 0.125 grams."
