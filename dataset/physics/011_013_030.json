    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of copper (Cu) at 298 K, we can use the formula:\n\nElectrical conductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nGiven that the resistivity of copper (ρ) is 1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm, we can calculate the electrical conductivity as follows:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm)\n\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of copper at 298 K is approximately 5.95 × 10^7 S/m."
