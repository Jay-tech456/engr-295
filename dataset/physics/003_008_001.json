    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of dimensions 10 cm x 20 cm carries a steady current of 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a point P located 5 cm above the center of the sheet.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the rectangular sheet, we can simplify the problem by considering the sheet as two long, parallel wires carrying half of the total current (1 A) each. The wires can be assumed to be located at the edges of the 10 cm side of the rectangle.\n\nLet's consider the magnetic field produced by each wire separately and then add them up to find the total magnetic field at point P. The magnetic field produced by a long, straight wire carrying current I at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nFor our problem, we have two wires carrying a current of 1 A each. The distance from each wire to point P can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr1 = sqrt((5 cm)^2 + (5 cm)^2) = 7.07 cm\nr2 = sqrt((5 cm)^2 + (15 cm)^2) = 15.81 cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by each wire at point P:\n\nB1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1 A) / (2 * π * 0.0707 m) ≈ 2.82 × 10^(-6) T\nB2 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1 A) / (2 * π * 0.1581 m) ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince the magnetic fields produced by the two wires are perpendicular to each other, we can find the total magnetic field at point P using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nB_total = sqrt(B1^2 + B2^2) ≈ sqrt((2.82 × 10^(-6) T)^2 + (1.26 × 10^(-6) T)^2) ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P located 5 cm above the center of the sheet is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-6) T."
