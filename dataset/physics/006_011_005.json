    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a₀) of a hydrogen atom when the electron is in its ground state can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere ε₀ is the permittivity of free space, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m_e is the electron mass, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nGiven the values:\nε₀ = 8.854187817 × 10^-12 m^-3 kg^-1 s^4\nħ = 1.054571817 × 10^-34 J s\nm_e = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg\ne = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C (elementary charge)\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\na₀ = (4π * (8.854187817 × 10^-12) * (1.054571817 × 10^-34)²) / ((9.10938356 × 10^-31) * (1.602176634 × 10^-19)²)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291772109 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom when the electron is in its ground state is approximately 5.291772109 × 10^-11 meters."
