    "message_2": "To calculate the overall thermal efficiency of the nuclear power plant, we need to consider the efficiency of both the reactor and the steam turbine. The reactor's energy output is given as 3 GW, and the steam turbine's efficiency is 42%.\n\nFirst, let's find the electrical power output of the steam turbine:\n\nElectrical power output = Steam turbine efficiency × Reactor energy output\nElectrical power output = 0.42 × 3 GW\nElectrical power output = 1.26 GW\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall thermal efficiency of the nuclear power plant:\n\nOverall thermal efficiency = (Electrical power output / Reactor energy output) × 100%\nOverall thermal efficiency = (1.26 GW / 3 GW) × 100%\nOverall thermal efficiency = 0.42 × 100%\nOverall thermal efficiency = 42%\n\nThe overall thermal efficiency of the nuclear power plant is 42%."
