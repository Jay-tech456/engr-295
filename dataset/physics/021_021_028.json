    "message_2": "The probability of black holes being a major contributor to dark matter is currently considered to be low based on the latest measurements and theoretical models. \n\nOne of the candidates for dark matter is primordial black holes (PBHs), which are black holes that could have formed in the early universe. However, recent studies and observations have constrained the possible mass range and abundance of PBHs, making it less likely that they account for a significant fraction of dark matter.\n\nFor example, the lack of observed gravitational lensing events, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the distribution of large-scale structures in the universe all provide constraints on the possible contribution of PBHs to dark matter. Additionally, the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes by LIGO and Virgo has provided further constraints on the abundance of PBHs.\n\nBased on these observations and theoretical models, the probability of black holes being a major contributor to dark matter is considered to be low. However, it is important to note that our understanding of dark matter is still incomplete, and future observations and discoveries could potentially change this conclusion."
