    "message_2": "To determine the magnification of the object using the mirror formula, we first need to find the image distance (v) and then use the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature (R) is related to the focal length (f) by:\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven that the radius of curvature (R) is 20 cm, we can find the focal length (f):\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The object distance (u) is given as 10 cm:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/10 + 1/v\n\nSubtracting 1/10 from both sides:\n\n0 = 1/v\nv = âˆž\n\nThis means that the image is formed at infinity.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nSince v is infinity, the magnification is undefined. In this case, the object is placed exactly at the focal point of the concave mirror, and the image is formed at infinity with an undefined magnification."
