    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of energy levels in an atom due to the presence of an external magnetic field. In the case of the hydrogen atom, the energy shift can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = μB * B * m\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, μB is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μB) is given by:\n\nμB = e * ħ / (2 * me)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js), and me is the mass of an electron (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg).\n\nCalculating the Bohr magneton:\n\nμB = (1.6 x 10^(-19) C) * (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\nμB ≈ 9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, for a hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n = 3, the possible values of the magnetic quantum number m are -1, 0, and 1. We will calculate the energy shift for each of these values.\n\nFor m = -1:\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * (1 T) * (-1)\nΔE = -9.274 x 10^(-24) J\n\nFor m = 0:\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * (1 T) * (0)\nΔE = 0 J\n\nFor m = 1:\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * (1 T) * (1)\nΔE = 9.274 x 10^(-24) J\n\nSo, the energy shifts for the hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n = 3 in the presence of an external magnetic field of 1 Tesla are -9.274 x 10^(-24) J, 0 J, and 9.274 x 10^(-24) J."
