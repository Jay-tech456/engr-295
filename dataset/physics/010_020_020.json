    "message_2": "The Herschel-Bulkley model is used to describe the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids. The equation for the shear stress (τ) of a Herschel-Bulkley fluid is given by:\n\nτ = τ_y + K * (γ)^n\n\nwhere τ_y is the yield stress, K is the viscosity index (also called consistency index), γ is the shear rate, and n is the power-law index (also called flow behavior index).\n\nGiven the values:\nτ_y = 25 Pa\nK = 0.12 Pa∙s^n\nn = 0.4\nγ = 100 s^-1\n\nWe can now calculate the shear stress:\n\nτ = 25 + 0.12 * (100)^0.4\n\nFirst, calculate the shear rate raised to the power-law index:\n\n(100)^0.4 ≈ 6.3096\n\nNow, multiply this value by the viscosity index:\n\n0.12 * 6.3096 ≈ 0.75715\n\nFinally, add the yield stress:\n\nτ = 25 + 0.75715 ≈ 25.75715 Pa\n\nSo, the shear stress of the Herschel-Bulkley fluid under the given conditions is approximately 25.75715 Pa."
