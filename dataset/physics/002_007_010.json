    "message_1": "What is the heat capacity of a piece of copper weighing 200 grams when it is heated from 20°C to 50°C, given that the specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g°C?",
    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the piece of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat capacity, m is the mass of the copper, c is the specific heat of copper, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 200 g\nc = 0.385 J/g°C\nΔT = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (200 g) × (0.385 J/g°C) × (30°C)\n\nQ = 2310 J\n\nThe heat capacity of the piece of copper is 2310 Joules."
