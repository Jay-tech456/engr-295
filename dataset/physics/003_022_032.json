    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by a motor with a current flowing through its wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nI = 4 A (current)\nN = 20 turns (number of turns)\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m (radius)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 4 A * 20) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 80 A) / 0.1 m\n\nB = (3.2π × 10⁻⁶ Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 32π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field produced by the motor is approximately 32π × 10⁻⁶ T."
