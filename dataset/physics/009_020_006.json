    "message_1": "A physics student is working with a diffraction grating of 500 lines per mm. The student is trying to determine the wavelength of monochromatic light that passes through the grating and produces a first order diffraction maximum at an angle of 30 degrees. What is the wavelength of the incident light?",
    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength of the incident light, we can use the diffraction grating formula:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines in the grating, θ is the angle of the first order diffraction maximum, m is the order of the maximum (in this case, m = 1 for the first order), and λ is the wavelength of the incident light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines in the grating (d). Since there are 500 lines per mm, the distance between the lines is:\n\nd = 1 / 500 lines per mm = 0.002 mm = 2 * 10^(-6) m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the diffraction grating formula:\n\n(2 * 10^(-6) m) * sin(30°) = 1 * λ\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5, so:\n\n(2 * 10^(-6) m) * 0.5 = λ\n\nλ = 1 * 10^(-6) m\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the incident light is 1 * 10^(-6) m or 1000 nm."
