    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that can be obtained from a black hole using the process of Hawking radiation is essentially the entire mass-energy of the black hole itself. Hawking radiation is a quantum effect that causes black holes to lose mass over time, eventually evaporating completely. The energy released during this process is in the form of particles and radiation.\n\nThe formula for the energy-mass equivalence is given by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light. So, the maximum energy that can be obtained from a black hole is equal to its mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.\n\nHarnessing this energy for practical purposes is currently purely theoretical and poses significant challenges. One potential method to capture Hawking radiation would be to build a structure, often referred to as a \"Dyson sphere,\" around the black hole. This structure would be designed to absorb the emitted radiation and convert it into usable energy.\n\nHowever, there are several issues with this concept. Firstly, Hawking radiation is incredibly weak for black holes of stellar mass or larger, making it extremely difficult to detect, let alone harness. Smaller black holes emit more Hawking radiation, but they are also more challenging to find and manipulate. Secondly, the engineering and materials required to build a structure capable of withstanding the extreme conditions near a black hole are currently beyond our technological capabilities.\n\nIn summary, while the maximum amount of energy that can be obtained from a black hole through Hawking radiation is theoretically equal to its entire mass-energy, harnessing this energy for practical purposes remains a significant challenge and is currently limited to the realm of theoretical physics and science fiction."
