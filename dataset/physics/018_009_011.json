    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a theoretical process by which black holes can lose mass and energy due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who first proposed the idea in 1974. The concept of Hawking radiation is based on the laws of thermodynamics and quantum field theory.\n\nTo understand how Hawking radiation affects the entropy and temperature of a black hole, we need to consider the laws of thermodynamics and the concept of black hole thermodynamics:\n\n1. First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In the context of black holes, this means that the energy of the black hole must decrease as it loses mass due to Hawking radiation.\n\n2. Second Law of Thermodynamics: The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. In the case of black holes, the entropy is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon.\n\n3. Black Hole Thermodynamics: The laws of thermodynamics can be applied to black holes, leading to the concept of black hole thermodynamics. The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass, and the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon.\n\nNow, let's discuss how Hawking radiation affects the entropy and temperature of a black hole:\n\n1. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses mass and energy. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the black hole decreases.\n\n2. The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. As the black hole loses mass due to Hawking radiation, its temperature increases.\n\n3. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. As the black hole loses mass, its event horizon shrinks, and its entropy decreases. However, the radiation emitted by the black hole carries away entropy, ensuring that the total entropy of the system (black hole + radiation) does not decrease, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nNow, let's calculate the rate of evaporating black holes and compare it to the lifetime of a typical black hole:\n\nThe power emitted by a black hole due to Hawking radiation can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = (ħc^6) / (15360πG^2M^2)\n\nwhere P is the power, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nThe rate of mass loss due to Hawking radiation can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndM/dt = -P/c^2\n\nThe lifetime of a black hole can be estimated by integrating this equation over time:\n\nτ = ∫(c^2 / P) dM\n\nFor a black hole with the mass of the Sun (M = 2 x 10^30 kg), the lifetime is estimated to be around 10^67 years, which is much longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 x 10^9 years).\n\nIn conclusion, Hawking radiation causes black holes to lose mass and energy, leading to an increase in temperature and a decrease in entropy. However, the rate of evaporation due to Hawking radiation is extremely slow for massive black holes, and their lifetimes are much longer than the age of the universe."
