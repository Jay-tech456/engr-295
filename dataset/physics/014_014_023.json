    "message_2": "To find the maximum energy of a cosmic ray proton when it interacts with a photon, we need to consider the pion production threshold. This is the minimum energy required for a high-energy proton to interact with a photon and produce a pion (π) in the process. The pion production threshold can be expressed as:\n\nE_p * E_γ ≥ (m_p + m_π)^2 - m_p^2\n\nwhere E_p is the energy of the proton, E_γ is the energy of the photon, m_p is the mass of the proton, and m_π is the mass of the pion. The masses of the proton and pion are approximately 938.272 MeV/c^2 and 139.570 MeV/c^2, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy of the photon with a wavelength of 2.5 x 10^-7 meters. The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_γ = (h * c) / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nE_γ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.5 x 10^-7 m)\nE_γ ≈ 7.95 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo convert this energy to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nE_γ ≈ (7.95 x 10^-19 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nE_γ ≈ 4.96 eV\n\nNow we can use the pion production threshold formula to find the maximum energy of the cosmic ray proton:\n\nE_p * 4.96 eV ≥ (938.272 MeV/c^2 + 139.570 MeV/c^2)^2 - (938.272 MeV/c^2)^2\nE_p ≥ ((938.272 MeV/c^2 + 139.570 MeV/c^2)^2 - (938.272 MeV/c^2)^2) / 4.96 eV\n\nE_p ≥ 6.84 x 10^20 eV\n\nSo, the maximum energy of a cosmic ray proton when it interacts with a photon with a wavelength of 2.5 x 10^-7 meters is approximately 6.84 x 10^20 eV.\n\nThe corresponding minimum energy of the photon required to produce this interaction can be found by rearranging the pion production threshold formula:\n\nE_γ_min = ((m_p + m_π)^2 - m_p^2) / E_p\n\nE_γ_min = ((938.272 MeV/c^2 + 139.570 MeV/c^2)^2 - (938.272 MeV/c^2)^2) / (6.84 x 10^20 eV)\nE_γ_min ≈ 7.23 x 10^-14 eV\n\nThe minimum energy of the photon required to produce this interaction is approximately 7.23 x 10^-14 eV."
