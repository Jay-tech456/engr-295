    "message_1": "A wire carrying a current of 5 A is used to form a square loop of side length 0.2 m. Determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current (I) passing through the loop. For a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and find the magnetic field due to each segment at the center. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to all four segments to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field due to a straight wire segment at a perpendicular distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current passing through the wire, and r is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nFor the square loop, the perpendicular distance (r) from the center to each wire segment is equal to half the diagonal of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal (d) and then r:\n\nd = √(0.2^2 + 0.2^2) = √(0.04 + 0.04) = √0.08\nr = d / 2 = √0.08 / 2\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field due to one wire segment at the center:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * √0.08 / 2)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we get:\n\nB₁ = (5 × 10^(-7) T) / (√0.08 / 2)\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center by summing up the magnetic fields due to all four wire segments:\n\nB_total = 4 * B₁ = 4 * (5 × 10^(-7) T) / (√0.08 / 2)\n\nB_total ≈ 1.414 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 1.414 × 10^(-6) T."
