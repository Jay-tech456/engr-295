    "message_1": "A hospital uses a radiopharmaceutical that emits gamma rays with an energy of 140 keV. The hospital wants to create a shielding system to protect people outside the room where the pharmaceutical is being used. How thick should the lead barrier be to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by 90%? The density of lead is 11.34 g/cc, and the linear attenuation coefficient for 140 keV gamma rays in lead is 0.14 cm⁻¹.",
    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the lead barrier needed to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by 90%, we can use the following equation:\n\nI = I₀ * e^(-μx)\n\nwhere:\nI is the final intensity of the gamma rays after passing through the lead barrier\nI₀ is the initial intensity of the gamma rays\nμ is the linear attenuation coefficient for 140 keV gamma rays in lead (0.14 cm⁻¹)\nx is the thickness of the lead barrier in centimeters\n\nSince we want to reduce the intensity by 90%, the final intensity (I) will be 10% of the initial intensity (I₀):\n\nI = 0.1 * I₀\n\nNow we can solve for the thickness (x) of the lead barrier:\n\n0.1 * I₀ = I₀ * e^(-μx)\n\nDivide both sides by I₀:\n\n0.1 = e^(-μx)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.1) = -μx\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = ln(0.1) / -μ\nx = ln(0.1) / -0.14\nx ≈ 1.61 cm\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the lead barrier should be approximately 1.61 cm to reduce the intensity of the 140 keV gamma rays by 90%."
