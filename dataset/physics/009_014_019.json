The lens has a focal length of 20 cm and refractive indices for red and violet light of 1.52 and 1.54 respectively. Calculate the difference in the focal length of the lens for red and violet light.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the difference in the focal length of the lens for red and violet light, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since the lens is the same for both red and violet light, the only difference is in the refractive indices. Therefore, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n1/f_red - 1/f_violet = (n_red - n_violet)(1/R1 - 1/R2).\n\nWe are given the focal length for the lens (f = 20 cm), and the refractive indices for red (n_red = 1.52) and violet light (n_violet = 1.54). We can assume that the lens is symmetric, so R1 = -R2. This simplifies the formula to:\n\n1/f_red - 1/f_violet = (n_red - n_violet)(2/R1).\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for the difference in focal lengths:\n\n1/f_red - 1/20 = (1.52 - 1.54)(2/R1).\n\nSince we are interested in the difference in focal lengths, we can rearrange the equation to find the difference:\n\n1/f_red - 1/20 = -0.02(2/R1).\n\nNow, we can use the lens maker's formula again to find the value of R1:\n\n1/20 = (1.52 - 1)(1/R1 - 1/(-R1)).\n\n1/20 = 0.52(2/R1).\n\nR1 = 0.52 * 20 / 2 = 5.2 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the value of R1 back into the equation for the difference in focal lengths:\n\n1/f_red - 1/20 = -0.02(2/5.2).\n\n1/f_red - 1/20 = -0.0076923.\n\n1/f_red = 1/20 + 0.0076923.\n\n1/f_red = 0.0576923.\n\nf_red = 1 / 0.0576923 = 17.33 cm.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference in focal lengths:\n\nDifference = f_red - f_violet = 17.33 cm - 20 cm = -2.67 cm.\n\nSo, the difference in the focal length of the lens for red and violet light is 2.67 cm."
