    "message_2": "The principle of non-locality in quantum mechanics refers to the phenomenon where particles that are entangled can instantaneously affect each other's state, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon has been experimentally confirmed and is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. It challenges our classical understanding of space and time, as well as the notion of causality.\n\nIn the context of black holes and their event horizon, non-locality plays a significant role in addressing the information paradox. The information paradox arises from the fact that, according to classical general relativity, any information that crosses the event horizon of a black hole is lost forever. This contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics, which state that information must be conserved.\n\nNon-locality can potentially resolve the information paradox through the concept of quantum entanglement. When particles become entangled, their quantum states become correlated, and any change in one particle's state will instantaneously affect the other, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon can be applied to particles near the event horizon of a black hole.\n\nAs a particle falls into a black hole, it can become entangled with another particle outside the event horizon. Through this entanglement, the information carried by the infalling particle can be preserved in the particle outside the black hole. This process is known as \"entanglement swapping\" or \"quantum teleportation.\" In this way, the information is not lost but rather transferred to the external particle, thus preserving the information.\n\nMoreover, the holographic principle, which is a conjecture in string theory, suggests that the information about the particles inside a black hole is encoded on the black hole's event horizon. This principle implies that the information is not lost but rather stored in a two-dimensional surface, which can be thought of as a hologram.\n\nIn conclusion, the principle of non-locality in quantum mechanics, through the concept of quantum entanglement and the holographic principle, provides a potential resolution to the information paradox in black holes. By allowing information to be preserved and transferred outside the event horizon, non-locality helps reconcile the apparent contradiction between classical general relativity and quantum mechanics. However, it is important to note that this is still an area of active research, and a complete understanding of the information paradox and its resolution is yet to be achieved."
