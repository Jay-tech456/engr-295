    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observed gravitational lensing of distant galaxies. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as another galaxy, due to its gravitational influence. This bending of light causes the background galaxy to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, as well as on the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThe presence of dark matter affects gravitational lensing in the following ways:\n\n1. Enhanced lensing effect: Dark matter contributes to the overall mass of a galaxy or galaxy cluster, increasing its gravitational influence on the light from background galaxies. This results in a stronger lensing effect, causing more significant distortions, magnifications, or multiple images of the background galaxies.\n\n2. Larger lensing area: The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy or galaxy cluster is typically more extended than the distribution of visible matter. This means that the region where gravitational lensing occurs is larger, increasing the probability of observing lensing effects.\n\n3. Substructure lensing: Dark matter is believed to form smaller substructures within galaxies and galaxy clusters. These substructures can also act as gravitational lenses, causing additional distortions or multiple images of background galaxies. This effect is known as substructure lensing and can provide valuable information about the distribution and properties of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter enhances the gravitational lensing effect, increases the lensing area, and introduces substructure lensing. By studying the observed gravitational lensing of distant galaxies, astronomers can gain insights into the distribution and properties of dark matter, which is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe."
