    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is proportional to the current (I) and the number of turns (N) in the coil, and inversely proportional to the distance (r) from the center of the coil. The formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nI = 2.5 A (current)\nN = 200 turns (number of turns)\nr = 0.05 m (radius of the coil)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A * 200) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2.5 * 200) / 0.1\n\nB ≈ (3.14 * 10^(-6) * 500) / 0.1\n\nB ≈ (1.57 * 10^(-3)) / 0.1\n\nB ≈ 0.0157 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil is approximately 0.0157 T (tesla)."
