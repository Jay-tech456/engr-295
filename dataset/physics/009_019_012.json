    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for a physics student to solve related to Young's Double Slit Experiment:\n\nA Young's Double Slit Experiment is set up in air with a light source emitting monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm. The distance between the slits is 0.5 mm and the distance from the slits to the screen is 2 m. If the interference pattern on the screen has a maximum intensity of 4.0 × 10^-4 W/m^2, what is the minimum distance between two adjacent bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum distance between two adjacent bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the fringe spacing in a Young's Double Slit Experiment:\n\nΔy = (λL) / d\n\nwhere Δy is the fringe spacing (the distance between adjacent bright fringes), λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 × 10^-9 m (converting to meters)\nL = 2 m\nd = 0.5 mm = 0.5 × 10^-3 m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔy = (600 × 10^-9 m × 2 m) / (0.5 × 10^-3 m)\n\nΔy = (1200 × 10^-9 m) / (0.5 × 10^-3 m)\n\nΔy = 2.4 × 10^-3 m\n\nSo, the minimum distance between two adjacent bright fringes on the screen is 2.4 × 10^-3 m or 2.4 mm."
