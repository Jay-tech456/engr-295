    "message_1": "A student is standing on Earth observing a spacecraft moving at 0.6c rapidly approaching them while simultaneously transmitting a 4.00 GHz signal. If the frequency of the signal is measured by the student with a detector, what will they measure? Take the rest frequency of the signal to be 3.75 GHz. Calculate the observed frequency and determine whether it is higher or lower than the rest frequency of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the observed frequency, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_rest is the rest frequency, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the spacecraft is moving at 0.6c, we have:\n\nf_observed = 3.75 GHz * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\n\nf_observed = 3.75 GHz * sqrt((1.6) / (0.4))\n\nf_observed = 3.75 GHz * sqrt(4)\n\nf_observed = 3.75 GHz * 2\n\nf_observed = 7.50 GHz\n\nThe observed frequency is 7.50 GHz, which is higher than the rest frequency of the signal (3.75 GHz)."
