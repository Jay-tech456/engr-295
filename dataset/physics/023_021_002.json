    "message_1": "What is the maximum possible number of qubits that can be encoded into the spin states of a single electron in quantum computing with spin qubits, and how does this limit the computational power of the system?",
    "message_2": "In quantum computing with spin qubits, a single electron can encode only two qubits. This is because an electron has two possible spin states: spin up and spin down. These two states can be represented as |0⟩ and |1⟩, which are the basic qubits in quantum computing.\n\nThe computational power of a quantum system is determined by the number of qubits it can manipulate. A single electron with two qubits can represent four possible states (00, 01, 10, and 11) simultaneously, thanks to the principle of superposition. However, the computational power of a system with only one electron is limited, as it can only perform simple quantum operations.\n\nTo increase the computational power of a quantum system, more qubits are needed. This can be achieved by using more electrons or other quantum particles with two-level systems, such as photons or atomic nuclei. The computational power of a quantum system grows exponentially with the number of qubits, allowing it to perform complex calculations and solve problems that are intractable for classical computers."
