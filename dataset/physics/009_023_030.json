The intensity of the polarized light after the first polarizer is 10 W/m². What will be the intensity of the light after it passes through the second polarizer? Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light after passing through a second polarizer is given by:\n\nI₂ = I₁ * cos²θ\n\nwhere I₁ is the intensity of light after the first polarizer, θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers, and I₂ is the intensity of light after the second polarizer.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n\nI₁ = 10 W/m²\nθ = 30°\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (in radians) = θ (in degrees) * (π / 180)\nθ = 30° * (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the intensity of light after the second polarizer:\n\nI₂ = I₁ * cos²θ\nI₂ = 10 W/m² * cos²(π / 6)\n\nI₂ = 10 W/m² * (cos(π / 6))^2\nI₂ = 10 W/m² * (0.866)^2\nI₂ = 10 W/m² * 0.75\n\nI₂ = 7.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer is 7.5 W/m²."
