    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Rayleigh criterion for the resolution of two objects. The Rayleigh criterion states that two objects can be resolved if the central maximum of one object's diffraction pattern falls on the first minimum of the other object's diffraction pattern. \n\nFor a human eye, the angular resolution can be calculated using the formula:\n\nθ = 1.22 * (λ / D)\n\nwhere θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the wavelength of light (in this case, 550 nm or 5.5 x 10^-7 m), and D is the diameter of the eye's pupil (approximately 2 mm or 2 x 10^-3 m).\n\nθ = 1.22 * (5.5 x 10^-7 m / 2 x 10^-3 m)\nθ ≈ 3.35 x 10^-4 radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the minimum distance (d) at which the student can distinguish the two parallel lines. The small angle approximation states that:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ\n\nLet L be the width of the lines, and let d be the minimum distance between the student and the lines. Then, we have:\n\nθ ≈ L / d\n\nRearranging for d, we get:\n\nd ≈ L / θ\n\nAssuming the width of the lines (L) is equal to the width of the eye's pupil (2 x 10^-3 m), we can calculate the minimum distance:\n\nd ≈ (2 x 10^-3 m) / (3.35 x 10^-4 radians)\nd ≈ 5.97 m\n\nSo, the minimum distance at which a student with normal vision can distinguish two parallel lines of equal brightness and width inside a dark room illuminated by a monochromatic light of wavelength 550 nm is approximately 5.97 meters."
