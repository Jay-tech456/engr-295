    "message_2": "To find the minimum speed required to prevent flow separation and stall, we can use the lift equation:\n\nLift (L) = 0.5 × Air Density (ρ) × Velocity² (V²) × Wing Area (A) × Lift Coefficient (CL)\n\nAt the minimum speed, the lift generated by the wings should be equal to the weight of the airplane. The weight of the airplane can be calculated using the wing loading:\n\nWeight (W) = Wing Loading × Wing Area\n\nWe can rearrange the lift equation to find the velocity:\n\nVelocity (V) = √(2 × Weight / (Air Density × Wing Area × Lift Coefficient))\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum speed, we need to consider the maximum lift coefficient (CL_max) at the point of stall. For most airplanes, CL_max is around 1.5 to 2.0. We will use an average value of 1.75 for this calculation.\n\nGiven the air density (ρ) = 0.9 kg/m³ and wing loading = 400 kg/m², we can find the minimum speed as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the weight (W) using wing loading and wing area:\n\nW = 400 kg/m² × A\n\n2. Calculate the minimum speed using the lift equation:\n\nV = √(2 × W / (0.9 kg/m³ × A × 1.75))\n\nSince we have W/A in the equation, we can substitute the wing loading value:\n\nV = √(2 × 400 kg/m² / (0.9 kg/m³ × 1.75))\n\nV ≈ √(800 / 1.575)\n\nV ≈ √508.06\n\nV ≈ 22.55 m/s\n\nSo, the minimum speed required for a plane to prevent flow separation and stall at an altitude of 10,000 feet with an air density of 0.9 kg/m³ and a wing loading of 400 kg/m² is approximately 22.55 m/s."
