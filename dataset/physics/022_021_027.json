    "message_2": "The likelihood that dark matter is composed of extra-dimensional particles is still uncertain, as there is no direct experimental evidence for extra dimensions or their associated particles. However, some theoretical models in particle physics do suggest the possibility of extra dimensions and their potential connection to dark matter.\n\nOne such model is the concept of Large Extra Dimensions (LED), proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, and Gia Dvali. In this model, gravity is allowed to propagate through extra dimensions, while other forces like electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces are confined to our familiar 3-dimensional space. This could potentially explain the weakness of gravity compared to other forces. In some LED scenarios, dark matter could be composed of particles called Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles, which are higher-dimensional analogs of known particles.\n\nAnother model is the concept of Universal Extra Dimensions (UED), in which all particles and forces can propagate through the extra dimensions. In this model, the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) could be a candidate for dark matter.\n\nDespite these theoretical models, there is no direct experimental evidence for extra-dimensional particles or their connection to dark matter. Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have searched for signs of extra dimensions and associated particles, but no conclusive evidence has been found so far. Indirect evidence, such as the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure of the universe, can also provide constraints on dark matter models, but they do not uniquely point to extra-dimensional particles as the source of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while some particle physics models suggest the possibility of extra-dimensional particles as dark matter candidates, there is currently no direct experimental evidence to support this idea. The likelihood of dark matter being composed of extra-dimensional particles remains uncertain, and further experimental and observational efforts are needed to explore this possibility."
