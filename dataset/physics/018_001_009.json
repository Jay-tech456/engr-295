    "message_2": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It is designed to reach a maximum collision energy of 14 teraelectronvolts (TeV), or 14 trillion electron volts.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles that originate from outer space and constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere. The energy of these particles can vary widely, from millions of electron volts (MeV) to extremely high energies of over 10^20 electron volts (EeV). Most cosmic rays have energies in the range of billions (GeV) to trillions (TeV) of electron volts.\n\nComparing the maximum energy achieved by the LHC to the energy of particles in cosmic rays, the LHC's 14 TeV is higher than the energy of most cosmic rays but still lower than the energy of the most energetic cosmic rays observed. It is important to note that the LHC produces these high-energy collisions in a controlled environment, whereas cosmic rays are naturally occurring and their sources are still not completely understood."
