    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (also known as the event horizon radius) of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, for a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses:\n\nM = 3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for G and c:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nR_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 x 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5.967 x 10^30)) / (8.987 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ (7.957 x 10^20) / (8.987 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ 8.86 x 10^3 meters\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius) of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8.86 kilometers."
