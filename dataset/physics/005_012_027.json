    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.9c).\n\nLet's calculate γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (2.294 - 1)(1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 1.294(1.67 x 10^-27 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nK ≈ 1.294(1.503 x 10^-10 kg m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 1.944 x 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 1.944 x 10^-10 Joules."
