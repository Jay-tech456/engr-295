    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated by a single myosin molecule during a power stroke of muscle contraction, we need to know the work done by the myosin molecule and the displacement it causes.\n\nThe work done by a myosin molecule during a power stroke can be estimated from the free energy released during the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule, which is the primary energy source for muscle contraction. The free energy released during the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule is approximately 50 piconewton-nanometers (pN·nm).\n\nNow, we know that work (W) is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the displacement (d) in the direction of the force:\n\nW = F × d\n\nWe are given that the myosin molecule moves 10 nm while pulling on an actin filament. Therefore, the displacement (d) is 10 nm.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the force (F):\n\nF = W / d\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nF = (50 pN·nm) / (10 nm)\n\nF = 5 piconewtons (pN)\n\nSo, the force generated by a single myosin molecule during a power stroke of muscle contraction is approximately 5 piconewtons."
