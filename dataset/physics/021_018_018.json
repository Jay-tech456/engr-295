    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole significantly affects the gravitational lensing of light passing near it. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a black hole, bends the spacetime around it, causing the path of light to curve. This bending of light is due to the strong gravitational field produced by the black hole.\n\nThe magnitude of this effect depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the light source and the black hole. The greater the mass of the black hole, the stronger the gravitational field, and the more pronounced the lensing effect. Similarly, the closer the light source is to the black hole, the more the light will be bent.\n\nOne way to quantify the magnitude of this effect is by calculating the deflection angle, which is the angle by which the light is bent as it passes near the black hole. The deflection angle (α) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter, which represents the closest distance between the light source and the black hole.\n\nThe deflection angle gives an indication of how much the light is bent, and thus, how strong the gravitational lensing effect is. In the case of a black hole, the deflection angle can be very large, leading to significant lensing effects. This can result in multiple images of a background object, or even the formation of an \"Einstein ring\" if the light source, black hole, and observer are perfectly aligned."
