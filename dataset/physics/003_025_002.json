    "message_1": "A current of 2.5A flows through a 10Ω resistor. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor. Assume that the current is uniformly distributed throughout the resistor.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 2.5 A and r = 5 cm = 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.05\n\nB = 0.0000025 T / 0.05\n\nB = 0.00005 T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor is 0.00005 T (Tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current flow (from the positive to the negative terminal of the resistor), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the resistor, with the direction depending on the orientation of the resistor and the direction of the current flow."
