    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 15 cm away from the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is square and lies in the xy-plane, we can divide it into four equal segments. We will calculate the magnetic field due to one segment and then multiply the result by 4 to account for the entire loop.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop, which is parallel to the x-axis. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along this segment. The position vector r can be written as:\n\nr = xi + (y - 0.25/2)j + zk\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the coordinates of the point of interest, and i, j, and k are the unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Since the point is in a plane perpendicular to the loop, z = 0. The point is 15 cm away from the center of the loop, so y = 0.15 m.\n\nThe differential length vector dl for the segment parallel to the x-axis is:\n\ndl = dx i\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate along the x-axis from -0.25/2 to 0.25/2:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫((-0.25/2) to (0.25/2)) (2 * dx i x (xi + (0.15 - 0.25/2)j)) / (x² + (0.15 - 0.25/2)²)^(3/2)\n\nAfter calculating the cross product and integrating, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 2 * (0.25/2) * (1 / (0.15 - 0.25/2)) * k\n\nNow we can multiply this result by 4 to account for the entire loop:\n\nB_total = 4 * B\n\nPlugging in the values for μ₀ and the given quantities:\n\nB_total = 4 * ((4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / 4π) * 2 * (0.25/2) * (1 / (0.15 - 0.25/2)) * k\n\nB_total = 8 × 10⁻⁷ T * (0.25/2) / (0.15 - 0.25/2) * k\n\nB_total ≈ 6.67 × 10⁻⁶ T * k\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point located 15 cm away from the center of the loop, in a plane perpendicular to the loop, is approximately 6.67 × 10⁻⁶ T in the positive z-direction."
