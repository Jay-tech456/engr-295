    "message_2": "The most suitable method for calculating quantum gravity effects in quantum field theory is the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). LQG is a non-perturbative and background-independent approach to the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is justified mathematically through the use of Ashtekar variables, spin networks, and spin foams.\n\nIn LQG, the basic idea is to quantize the geometry of spacetime itself, rather than just the matter fields on a fixed background spacetime as in traditional quantum field theory. The Ashtekar variables are a set of new variables for general relativity that make the quantization process more manageable. They consist of a densitized triad and a connection, which are related to the metric and the extrinsic curvature of spacetime.\n\nThe quantization of the geometry of spacetime is achieved through the introduction of spin networks. Spin networks are graphs with edges labeled by spins (representing areas) and nodes labeled by intertwiners (representing volumes). They provide a basis for the Hilbert space of quantum states of geometry. The dynamics of the theory are encoded in spin foams, which are higher-dimensional generalizations of spin networks that describe the evolution of quantum states of geometry.\n\nThe mathematical justification for LQG comes from the rigorous formulation of the theory using the Ashtekar variables, the construction of the kinematical Hilbert space using spin networks, and the definition of the dynamics using spin foams. The LQG framework has been successful in providing a finite and background-independent quantization of gravity, and it has led to several important results, such as the derivation of the area and volume spectra, the calculation of black hole entropy, and the study of cosmological models.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that LQG is not the only approach to quantum gravity. Other approaches, such as string theory and causal dynamical triangulations, have also been developed and have their own mathematical justifications. The ultimate test for the validity of these approaches will come from their ability to make testable predictions and to provide a consistent and complete description of the quantum nature of gravity."
