    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 10,000 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 10,000 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^34 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (1.989 × 10^34 kg) / (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11) × (1.989 × 10^34) / (9 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2 × (1.327 × 10^24) / (9 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.954 × 10^7 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 10,000 solar masses is approximately 2.954 × 10^7 meters or 29.54 million meters."
