    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 6 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the problem states that the sphere carries a current, we need to first clarify the distribution of the current on the sphere. \n\nAssuming the current is uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere, we can treat the sphere as a collection of infinitesimally small current loops. The magnetic field at a point outside the sphere due to each current loop can be calculated using the Biot-Savart Law and then integrated over the entire surface of the sphere.\n\nThe Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the sphere has a radius of 4 cm and the point P is at a distance of 6 cm from the center, we can use spherical coordinates to describe the position of point P. Let θ be the polar angle between the position vector r and the z-axis, and let φ be the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane. The position vector r can be written as:\n\nr = 6 * (sinθ * cosφ * î + sinθ * sinφ * ĵ + cosθ * k)\n\nNow, we need to find the infinitesimal current element Idl on the sphere. Since the current is uniformly distributed on the surface, we can write the current density J as:\n\nJ = I / (4π * R²)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere (4 cm). The infinitesimal current element Idl can be written as:\n\nIdl = J * ds\n\nwhere ds is the infinitesimal surface area element on the sphere. In spherical coordinates, ds can be written as:\n\nds = R² * sinθ * dθ * dφ\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for r, Idl, and ds into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫ ((μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³) * ds\n\nSince the problem involves a complex integral, it is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response to solve it analytically. However, you can use numerical methods or specialized mathematical software to evaluate the integral and find the magnetic field at the point P."
