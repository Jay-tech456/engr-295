    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant (alpha_s) is a fundamental parameter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong nuclear force between quarks and gluons. The value of alpha_s depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.\n\nThe most accurate experimental value for the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (about 91.2 GeV) is α_s(M_Z) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011. This value is obtained from a combination of various experimental measurements, including those from electron-positron annihilation, deep inelastic scattering, and hadron collider experiments.\n\nThe theoretical predictions from QCD are in good agreement with the experimental values. The perturbative QCD calculations, which are based on the renormalization group equations, allow us to compute the running of alpha_s as a function of the energy scale. These calculations have been tested and confirmed by numerous experimental measurements over a wide range of energy scales.\n\nIn summary, the most accurate experimental value for the strong coupling constant is α_s(M_Z) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011, and it is consistent with the theoretical predictions from Quantum Chromodynamics."
