    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of transmitted light through a polarizing filter is given by:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and θ is the angle between the filter's transmission axis and the incident light polarization plane.\n\nHowever, since the incident light is unpolarized, we need to consider that the average intensity of the unpolarized light is half of the total intensity. This is because unpolarized light can be considered as a combination of two orthogonal polarization components with equal intensities.\n\nSo, the average intensity of the unpolarized light is:\n\nI_average = 0.5 * I_incident\n\nNow, we can apply Malus' Law using the average intensity of the unpolarized light:\n\nI_transmitted = I_average * cos^2(θ)\n\nGiven that θ = 45 degrees, we can convert it to radians:\n\nθ = 45 * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_transmitted = (0.5 * I_incident) * cos^2(π/4)\n\nI_transmitted = (0.5 * I_incident) * (1/2)\n\nI_transmitted = 0.25 * I_incident\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted polarized light through the polarizing filter is 0.25 times the intensity of the incident unpolarized light."
