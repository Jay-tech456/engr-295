    "message_2": "To calculate the dose rate in mR/h at a distance of 1 meter from a 1 Ci source of gamma radiation, we need to use the inverse square law and the exposure constant for the specific gamma-emitting radionuclide. The inverse square law states that the intensity of radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the source. The exposure constant (also known as the dose rate constant) is a factor that relates the activity of the source to the dose rate at a specific distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the exposure constant for the specific radionuclide. Unfortunately, the problem statement does not provide the specific radionuclide, so we cannot determine the exact exposure constant. However, we can use a general value for gamma-emitting radionuclides, which is typically in the range of 5-30 R·cm²/(Ci·h) (Roentgen per square centimeter per Curie-hour). For this problem, let's assume an exposure constant of 15 R·cm²/(Ci·h).\n\nNow, we can use the inverse square law and the exposure constant to calculate the dose rate at a distance of 1 meter (100 cm) from the source:\n\nDose rate (mR/h) = (Exposure constant × Activity) / (Distance²)\nDose rate (mR/h) = (15 R·cm²/(Ci·h) × 1 Ci) / (100 cm)²\nDose rate (mR/h) = 15 R·cm²/(h) / 10000 cm²\nDose rate (mR/h) = 0.0015 R/h\n\nSince 1 R (Roentgen) is approximately equal to 1 rad, and 1 rad is approximately equal to 1 rem, we can convert the dose rate from R/h to mR/h:\n\nDose rate (mR/h) = 0.0015 R/h × 1000 mR/R\nDose rate (mR/h) = 1.5 mR/h\n\nSo, the dose rate at a distance of 1 meter from a 1 Ci source of gamma radiation is approximately 1.5 mR/h. Note that this value is an estimation based on a general exposure constant and may vary depending on the specific radionuclide and its energy spectrum."
