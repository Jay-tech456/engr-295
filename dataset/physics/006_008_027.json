    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of an electron emitted from the cesium surface, we first need to determine the energy of the incident ultraviolet radiation. We can do this using the equation:\n\nE_photon = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation (200 nm or 200 x 10^(-9) m).\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (200 x 10^(-9) m)\nE_photon = 9.939 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNow we need to convert the work function of cesium from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^(-19) J.\n\nWork function (J) = 1.9 eV * 1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV\nWork function (J) = 3.0438 x 10^(-19) J\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of an emitted electron can be found using the equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - Work function\n\nK_max = 9.939 x 10^(-19) J - 3.0438 x 10^(-19) J\nK_max = 6.8952 x 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy of an electron emitted from the cesium surface when exposed to ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 200 nm and an intensity of 2.0 mW/m² is approximately 6.8952 x 10^(-19) J."
