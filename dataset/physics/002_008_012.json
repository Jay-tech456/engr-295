    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a metal block that requires 100 J of energy to raise its temperature by 10°C, given that the mass of the metal block is 500 g?",
    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed or released (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in kilograms), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/kg°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nQ = 100 J (energy required to raise the temperature)\nΔT = 10°C (change in temperature)\nm = 500 g = 0.5 kg (mass of the metal block, converted to kilograms)\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 100 J / (0.5 kg × 10°C)\nc = 100 J / 5 kg°C\nc = 20 J/kg°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the metal block is 20 J/kg°C."
