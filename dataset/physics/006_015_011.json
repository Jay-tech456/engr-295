    "message_2": "The Mössbauer effect is a phenomenon in which gamma-ray photons are emitted or absorbed by atomic nuclei without any loss of energy due to the recoil of the nucleus. This effect is possible because the emitting and absorbing nuclei are embedded in a crystal lattice, which absorbs the recoil energy.\n\nTo calculate the change in energy and velocity of an atom undergoing the Mössbauer effect, we first need to determine the energy of the gamma-ray photon. In this case, the energy of the photon is given as 14.4 keV (kilo-electron volts), which is equivalent to 14.4 x 10^3 eV. To convert this energy to joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nE_photon = 14.4 x 10^3 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.307 x 10^-15 J\n\nNow, let's consider the conservation of momentum. Since the crystal lattice absorbs the recoil energy, the momentum of the atom before and after the emission or absorption of the gamma-ray photon remains the same. Therefore, the change in velocity of the atom is zero.\n\nAs for the change in energy, the energy of the atom remains constant during the Mössbauer effect because the energy of the gamma-ray photon is completely transferred to or from the nucleus without any loss due to recoil. Thus, the change in energy of the atom is also zero.\n\nIn summary, for an atom undergoing the Mössbauer effect when emitting or absorbing a gamma-ray photon with a specific energy of 14.4 keV, the change in energy is 0 J, and the change in velocity is 0 m/s."
