    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nFor a circular loop of wire with radius R, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is uniform and perpendicular to the plane of the loop. We can write Ampere's Law as:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀ * I\n\nWhere B is the magnetic field, dl is the infinitesimal length along the circular path, and I is the current.\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀ * I\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the circular path is equal to the circumference of the circle:\n\nB * 2πR = μ₀ * I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πR)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A."
