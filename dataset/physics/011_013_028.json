    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of copper at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 5.96 x 10^7 Siemens per meter (S/m). This high conductivity makes copper an excellent conductor of electricity and a common material used in electrical wiring.\n\nSeveral factors influence the electrical conductivity of copper:\n\n1. Temperature: As the temperature increases, the conductivity of copper decreases. This is because the increased thermal energy causes the atoms in the copper lattice to vibrate more, leading to more frequent collisions with the electrons, which in turn increases the electrical resistance.\n\n2. Impurities: The presence of impurities in the copper can reduce its conductivity. Impurities, such as other metals or non-metallic elements, can disrupt the regular arrangement of copper atoms in the lattice, leading to increased scattering of electrons and a decrease in conductivity.\n\n3. Crystal structure: The crystal structure of copper plays a significant role in its conductivity. Copper has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which allows for efficient electron movement through the lattice. Any defects or irregularities in the crystal structure can negatively impact conductivity.\n\n4. Strain and deformation: Mechanical strain and deformation can also affect the conductivity of copper. When copper is subjected to stress or strain, the crystal lattice can become distorted, leading to a decrease in conductivity.\n\n5. Oxidation: The formation of an oxide layer on the surface of copper can reduce its conductivity. Copper oxide is a poor conductor of electricity, so the presence of an oxide layer can impede the flow of electrons at the surface of the material."
