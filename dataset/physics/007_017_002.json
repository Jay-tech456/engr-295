    "message_2": "The cross section for a nuclear reaction is a measure of the probability that the reaction will occur. For the specific case of neutron-induced fission of uranium-235, the cross section depends on the energy of the incident neutron.\n\nAt thermal energies (neutron energy around 0.025 eV), the fission cross section for uranium-235 is quite large, approximately 580 barns (1 barn = 10^-24 cm^2). This is one of the reasons why uranium-235 is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors, as it has a high probability of undergoing fission when interacting with slow (thermal) neutrons.\n\nAs the neutron energy increases, the fission cross section generally decreases. However, there are resonances at certain neutron energies where the cross section increases significantly. These resonances are due to the quantum mechanical nature of the interaction between the neutron and the uranium-235 nucleus.\n\nIn summary, the fission cross section for uranium-235 depends on the energy of the incident neutron, with a value of about 580 barns at thermal energies."
