    "message_2": "To determine the maximum distance at which a superconducting power cable can transmit electricity with 99% efficiency compared to a conventional copper cable, we need to first find the power loss in the copper cable and then calculate the distance for the superconducting cable with 99% efficiency.\n\n1. Calculate the power loss in the copper cable:\n\nPower loss (P_loss) in a cable is given by the formula P_loss = I^2 * R, where I is the current and R is the resistance of the cable.\n\nResistance (R) of a cable can be calculated using the formula R = ρ * (L/A), where ρ is the resistivity of the material (copper in this case), L is the length of the cable, and A is the cross-sectional area of the cable.\n\nFor copper, the resistivity (ρ) is approximately 1.68 × 10^-8 ohm meters.\n\nLet's assume a cross-sectional area (A) of 1 cm^2 or 1 × 10^-4 m^2 for the copper cable.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the resistance formula as R = (1.68 × 10^-8) * (L / 1 × 10^-4).\n\n2. Calculate the power loss for the copper cable:\n\nP_loss = I^2 * R = (1000 A)^2 * (1.68 × 10^-8) * (L / 1 × 10^-4)\n\nP_loss = 1 × 10^6 * 1.68 × 10^-8 * L\n\nP_loss = 1.68 × 10^-2 * L\n\n3. Calculate the power loss for the superconducting cable:\n\nSince the superconducting cable has 99% efficiency compared to the copper cable, the power loss in the superconducting cable will be 1% of the power loss in the copper cable.\n\nP_loss_superconductor = 0.01 * P_loss_copper\n\nP_loss_superconductor = 0.01 * 1.68 × 10^-2 * L\n\n4. Calculate the maximum distance for the superconducting cable:\n\nSince the power loss in the superconducting cable is negligible, we can assume that the resistance of the superconducting cable is also negligible.\n\nNow, we can equate the power loss in the copper cable to the power loss in the superconducting cable and solve for the length (L).\n\n0.01 * 1.68 × 10^-2 * L = 1.68 × 10^-2 * L_superconductor\n\nL_superconductor = 100 * L\n\nThe maximum distance at which a superconducting power cable can transmit electricity with 99% efficiency compared to a conventional copper cable is 100 times the length of the copper cable. The actual distance will depend on the specific power loss requirements and cable specifications."
