    "message_2": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica is designed to detect high-energy neutrinos from cosmic sources. The energy of cosmic neutrinos detected by IceCube typically ranges from 100 GeV to several PeV (1 PeV = 10^15 eV). The average energy of these cosmic neutrinos is around 100 TeV (1 TeV = 10^12 eV), although it can vary depending on the specific astrophysical sources and the neutrino production mechanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, neutrinos produced in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have much lower energies. The LHC primarily produces neutrinos as a byproduct of proton-proton collisions, with energies typically in the range of a few GeV to a few tens of GeV. The average energy of these neutrinos is around 10 GeV.\n\nComparing the two, the average energy of cosmic neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is about four orders of magnitude (10,000 times) higher than the energy of neutrinos produced in particle accelerators like the LHC. This difference in energy allows researchers to study different aspects of neutrino physics and astrophysics, as well as probe the fundamental properties of these elusive particles."
