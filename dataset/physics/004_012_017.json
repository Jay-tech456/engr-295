    "message_2": "To calculate the critical density of the universe, we need to know the present expansion rate, which is given by the Hubble constant (H0). The Hubble constant is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec). We can use this value to find the critical density using the following formula:\n\nCritical density (ρ_c) = (3 * H0^2) / (8 * π * G)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Hubble constant to SI units (meters per second per meter):\n\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc * (1000 m/km) * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 m) ≈ 2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula for critical density:\n\nρ_c = (3 * (2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1)^2) / (8 * π * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nρ_c ≈ 8.638 × 10^-27 kg/m^3\n\nSo, the critical density of the universe is approximately 8.638 × 10^-27 kg/m^3, assuming a spatially flat universe according to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric."
