    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient of a crystal of NaCl at room temperature, we can use the Grüneisen relation, which connects the thermal expansion coefficient (α), the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv), the bulk modulus (B), and the Grüneisen parameter (γ). The relation is given by:\n\nα = (γ * Cv) / B\n\nFirst, we need to find the Grüneisen parameter (γ). In Debye's theory, the Grüneisen parameter is given by:\n\nγ = (V * ∂lnω / ∂V) / (k * T)\n\nwhere V is the volume of the unit cell, ω is the Debye frequency, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFor a NaCl crystal, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:\n\nV = a^3\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant. Given a = 5.64 Å = 5.64 * 10^(-10) m, we have:\n\nV = (5.64 * 10^(-10))^3 = 1.79 * 10^(-28) m^3\n\nNow, we need to find the Debye frequency (ω). Using the assumptions of the Einstein model, the Debye frequency can be estimated as:\n\nω = (k * Θ_D) / ħ\n\nwhere Θ_D is the Debye temperature and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The Debye temperature for NaCl is approximately 321 K. The Boltzmann constant (k) is 1.38 * 10^(-23) J/K, and the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is 1.05 * 10^(-34) Js. Therefore, we have:\n\nω = (1.38 * 10^(-23) * 321) / (1.05 * 10^(-34)) = 4.25 * 10^12 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the Grüneisen parameter (γ). Since the Grüneisen parameter is typically a constant for most materials, we can assume γ ≈ 2 for NaCl.\n\nNext, we need to find the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv). Using the Debye model, the specific heat capacity can be calculated as:\n\nCv = 3 * N * k * (T / Θ_D)^3 * ∫(0 to Θ_D/T) (x^4 * e^x) / (e^x - 1)^2 dx\n\nwhere N is the number of atoms in the unit cell. For NaCl, N = 2 (one Na and one Cl atom). At room temperature (T = 25°C = 298 K), we have:\n\nCv ≈ 3 * 2 * 1.38 * 10^(-23) * (298 / 321)^3 * 6.10 = 1.24 * 10^(-23) J/K\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) using the Grüneisen relation:\n\nα = (γ * Cv) / B\n\nThe bulk modulus (B) is given as 24 GPa = 24 * 10^9 Pa. Therefore, we have:\n\nα = (2 * 1.24 * 10^(-23)) / (24 * 10^9) = 1.03 * 10^(-11) K^(-1)\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of a NaCl crystal at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 1.03 * 10^(-11) K^(-1)."
