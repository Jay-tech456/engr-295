    "message_2": "Dark radiation typically refers to hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and radiation, similar to neutrinos. These particles are often called \"sterile neutrinos\" and are considered a potential candidate for dark matter. The abundance of dark radiation is usually quantified in terms of the effective number of neutrino species, denoted as Neff.\n\nThe standard model of cosmology predicts Neff to be around 3.046, which accounts for the three known types of neutrinos. However, if there is an additional contribution from dark radiation, Neff would be higher than this value. Observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure of the universe can provide constraints on Neff. Current measurements from the Planck satellite suggest Neff to be around 3.13 Â± 0.32, which is consistent with the standard model prediction but also allows for a small contribution from dark radiation.\n\nThe presence of dark radiation can affect our understanding of dark matter's composition in several ways:\n\n1. If sterile neutrinos are a significant component of dark matter, it would imply that dark matter is not solely composed of cold dark matter (CDM) particles, which are non-relativistic and interact only through gravity. Instead, dark matter would have a \"warm\" component, with sterile neutrinos having non-negligible velocities.\n\n2. The existence of dark radiation could affect the formation of cosmic structures. Warm dark matter particles, like sterile neutrinos, can erase small-scale structures due to their higher velocities compared to CDM particles. This could potentially help resolve some discrepancies between observations and simulations of small-scale structures in the universe.\n\n3. The detection of dark radiation would have implications for particle physics and the standard model. It would provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model and could help constrain the properties of sterile neutrinos, such as their masses and mixing angles with active neutrinos.\n\nIn summary, the estimated abundance of dark radiation is still uncertain, with current observations being consistent with both the standard model prediction and a small contribution from dark radiation. If dark radiation is indeed present, it would affect our understanding of dark matter's composition by introducing a warm component and having implications for both cosmology and particle physics."
