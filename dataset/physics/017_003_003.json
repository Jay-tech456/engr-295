    "message_2": "To determine the refractive index of a silicon wafer at a wavelength of 632.8 nm, we need to know the real part of the complex refractive index (n) and the imaginary part (k), which is the extinction coefficient. The complex refractive index is given by:\n\nN = n + ik\n\nWhere N is the complex refractive index, n is the real part, and k is the imaginary part (extinction coefficient).\n\nWe are given the extinction coefficient (k) as 0.001. To find the real part (n) of the refractive index, we need to refer to the literature or experimental data for silicon at the given wavelength (632.8 nm). \n\nAccording to the literature, the refractive index of silicon at a wavelength of 632.8 nm is approximately 3.48 (source: Palik, E. D. (1991). Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids. Academic Press).\n\nSo, the complex refractive index of silicon at 632.8 nm is:\n\nN = 3.48 + 0.001i\n\nThe refractive index (real part) of the silicon wafer at a wavelength of 632.8 nm is approximately 3.48."
