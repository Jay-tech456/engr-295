    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content, does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it exerts a gravitational force on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, and influences the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe process of galaxy cluster and supercluster formation begins with small fluctuations in the density of dark matter in the early universe. These fluctuations, which are thought to have originated from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary period, grow over time due to gravitational instability.\n\nAs the denser regions of dark matter attract more and more matter (both dark and visible), they eventually collapse to form dark matter halos. These halos serve as the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The visible matter, primarily composed of gas, falls into the gravitational potential wells created by the dark matter halos, leading to the formation of stars and galaxies.\n\nGalaxy clusters form when multiple galaxies are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, which is primarily due to the dark matter within and surrounding them. Superclusters, which are large-scale structures composed of multiple galaxy clusters, also form due to the gravitational influence of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter is essential for the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters. The initial density fluctuations in dark matter lead to the formation of dark matter halos, which in turn provide the gravitational framework for the formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters. Without dark matter, the large-scale structure of the universe would be vastly different, and the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters as we observe them today would not be possible."
