    "message_1": "A long straight wire carries a current of 5 A. If the distance from the wire to a point P is 0.1 m, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P due to the current in the wire, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law for a long straight wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to point P.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 5 A\nr = 0.1 m\n\nWe can now calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
