    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe and affects the distribution of visible matter. Although dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, it interacts through gravity, making it detectable through its gravitational effects on visible matter and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nMathematical Models:\n\n1. Cold Dark Matter (CDM) Model: The CDM model is the most widely accepted model for the distribution of dark matter in the universe. In this model, dark matter consists of slow-moving, non-relativistic particles that clump together to form large-scale structures. The density fluctuations in the early universe grow through gravitational instability, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nΔρ/ρ = (ρ - ρ̅) / ρ̅, where Δρ/ρ is the density contrast, ρ is the local density, and ρ̅ is the average density of the universe.\n\nThe growth of these density fluctuations can be described by the linear growth factor, D(a), where a is the scale factor:\n\nD(a) = a(t) / a(t0), where t0 is the present time.\n\n2. N-body simulations: N-body simulations are numerical models that simulate the gravitational interactions between a large number of particles, representing both dark matter and visible matter. These simulations help us understand the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nObservational Evidence:\n\n1. Galaxy Rotation Curves: The rotation curves of galaxies show that the velocity of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies remains constant or increases with distance from the galactic center, instead of decreasing as expected from the visible matter distribution. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the outer stars in their orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational Lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground, such as galaxy clusters, provides evidence for the presence of dark matter. The observed lensing effect is stronger than what can be accounted for by the visible matter alone, indicating the presence of a significant amount of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be analyzed to determine the distribution of dark matter and visible matter. The observed power spectrum of the CMB is consistent with the predictions of the Cold Dark Matter model, supporting the presence of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure distribution: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Observations of the large-scale structure, such as the cosmic web, match the predictions of the Cold Dark Matter model and N-body simulations, which include the effects of dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter plays a significant role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe and affects the distribution of visible matter. The Cold Dark Matter model, N-body simulations, and various observational evidence, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure distribution, all support the presence and influence of dark matter in the universe."
