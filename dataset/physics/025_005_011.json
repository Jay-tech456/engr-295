    "message_2": "To calculate the force required to stretch a single DNA molecule by 10% of its original length, we can use Hooke's Law. Hooke's Law states that the force (F) required to stretch or compress a spring by some distance (x) is proportional to that distance, with the proportionality constant being the spring constant (k).\n\nF = k * x\n\nIn this case, the DNA molecule can be treated as a spring, and the modulus of elasticity (E) can be used to determine the spring constant (k). The modulus of elasticity is defined as the ratio of stress to strain, and for a spring, stress is equivalent to force (F) and strain is equivalent to the fractional change in length (ΔL/L).\n\nE = F / (ΔL/L)\n\nWe are given the modulus of elasticity (E) as 1000 pN, and we want to stretch the DNA molecule by 10% of its original length (500 nm). Therefore, the change in length (ΔL) is 10% of 500 nm, which is 50 nm.\n\nNow we can rearrange the equation for the modulus of elasticity to solve for the force (F):\n\nF = E * (ΔL/L)\n\nF = 1000 pN * (50 nm / 500 nm)\n\nF = 1000 pN * 0.1\n\nF = 100 pN\n\nSo, the force required to stretch a single DNA molecule by 10% of its original length is 100 pN."
