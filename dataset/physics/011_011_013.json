    "message_2": "Quartz, a piezoelectric material, belongs to the trigonal crystal system and exhibits the highest piezoelectric effect along its Z-axis, which is also known as the c-axis or the optical axis. The piezoelectric effect in quartz is primarily due to its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which lacks a center of symmetry.\n\nThe magnitude of the piezoelectric effect in quartz is influenced by temperature and mechanical stress. As temperature increases, the piezoelectric properties of quartz tend to degrade. This is because the crystal lattice structure becomes less ordered at higher temperatures, leading to a decrease in the piezoelectric coefficients. The Curie temperature of quartz is around 573Â°C, above which it loses its piezoelectric properties and undergoes a phase transition to a centrosymmetric structure.\n\nMechanical stress also affects the piezoelectric effect in quartz. When stress is applied to the crystal, the lattice structure is deformed, leading to a change in the polarization and, consequently, the piezoelectric effect. The relationship between mechanical stress and the piezoelectric effect is linear within the elastic limit of the material. However, if the stress exceeds the elastic limit, the crystal structure may be permanently damaged, and the piezoelectric properties may be altered or lost.\n\nIn summary, quartz exhibits the highest piezoelectric effect along its Z-axis (c-axis), and the magnitude of the effect is influenced by temperature and mechanical stress. The piezoelectric properties degrade with increasing temperature and can be affected by mechanical stress within the elastic limit of the material."
