    "message_2": "The maximum depth a scuba diver can reach without a diving suit depends on several factors, including water temperature, pressure, and the individual's physical condition. However, we can provide a general estimation based on the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics and oceanography.\n\nFirst, let's consider the temperature. As a diver descends, the water temperature typically decreases. Without a diving suit, a diver will be exposed to the cold water, which can lead to hypothermia. The human body can tolerate water temperatures above 20째C (68째F) for extended periods, but as the temperature drops, the risk of hypothermia increases. In general, a diver without a suit should not descend into water colder than 10-15째C (50-59째F) to avoid hypothermia.\n\nNext, let's consider pressure. As a diver descends, the pressure increases by approximately 1 atmosphere (atm) for every 10 meters (33 feet) of depth. The human body can withstand increased pressure to a certain extent, but beyond a certain depth, the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) and nitrogen narcosis increases. Recreational divers are generally advised not to exceed depths of 30-40 meters (100-130 feet) even with proper equipment.\n\nTaking both temperature and pressure into account, a scuba diver without a diving suit should not exceed a depth of around 30 meters (100 feet) to minimize the risks of hypothermia, decompression sickness, and nitrogen narcosis. However, this is a general estimation, and individual tolerance may vary. It is essential for divers to be aware of their limits and follow safety guidelines to ensure a safe diving experience."
