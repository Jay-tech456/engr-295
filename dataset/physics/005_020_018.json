    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth at a speed of 0.8c. The onboard radar sends out a signal of frequency 10 GHz. Determine the frequency of the radar signal observed by an observer on Earth if the speed of light is 3 x 10^8m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which relates the observed frequency (f_obs) to the source frequency (f_src) and the relative velocity between the observer and the source (v). The formula is:\n\nf_obs = f_src * sqrt((1 + (v/c))/(1 - (v/c)))\n\nwhere\nf_src = 10 GHz (source frequency)\nv = 0.8c (relative velocity)\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values and calculate the frequency observed by the observer on Earth:\n\nf_obs = 10 * 10^9 * sqrt((1 + (0.8))/(1 - (0.8)))\n\nf_obs = 10 * 10^9 * sqrt((1.8)/(0.2))\n\nf_obs = 10 * 10^9 * sqrt(9)\n\nf_obs = 10 * 10^9 * 3\n\nf_obs = 30 * 10^9 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the radar signal observed by an observer on Earth is 30 GHz."
