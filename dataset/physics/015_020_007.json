    "message_2": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is a space-based gravitational wave observatory designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves from various astronomical sources, including binary white dwarf systems in the Milky Way galaxy. The expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for LISA's detection of gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs depends on several factors, such as the distance to the source, the masses of the white dwarfs, and the sensitivity of the LISA detectors.\n\nLISA's sensitivity is highest in the frequency range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz, which is well-suited for detecting gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs. The SNR for a given source depends on the ratio of the signal amplitude to the detector noise, which is a function of the source's frequency and distance.\n\nFor a typical binary white dwarf system in the Milky Way, the expected SNR can range from a few to several hundred. The exact value will depend on the specific properties of the binary system and its location within the galaxy. In general, LISA is expected to detect thousands of binary white dwarf systems with varying SNRs, allowing for a detailed study of these systems and their role in the galaxy's evolution.\n\nIt is important to note that the actual SNR values for LISA's detection of gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs will be determined once the mission is operational and collecting data. The current estimates are based on simulations and theoretical models, which may be refined as our understanding of these systems and LISA's capabilities improve."
