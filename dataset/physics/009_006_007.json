    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nMagnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nGiven:\nObject distance (u) = 1.5 meters\nFocal length (f) = 0.5 meters\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/0.5 = 1/1.5 + 1/v\n2 = 2/3 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can multiply both sides by 3v:\n\n6v = 4v + 3\n2v = 3\nv = 1.5 meters\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -1.5/1.5\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1, which means the image is inverted and has the same size as the object.\n\nSince the student's height is 1.6 meters, the image height will also be 1.6 meters (but inverted).\n\nSo, the image is 1.5 meters away from the mirror, and the magnification is -1."
