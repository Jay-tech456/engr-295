    "message_2": "To find the maximum energy that can be obtained by a proton in a Medical Cyclotron, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = q * B * R * c\n\nwhere E is the energy, q is the charge of the proton, B is the magnetic field strength, R is the radius of the circular path, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe charge of a proton (q) is 1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs, the magnetic field strength (B) is 1.5 Tesla, the radius of the circular path (R) is 0.5 meters, and the speed of light (c) is 3 x 10^8 meters per second.\n\nE = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (1.5 T) * (0.5 m) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nE = 3.6 x 10^-10 Joules\n\nSo, the maximum energy that can be obtained by a proton in a Medical Cyclotron with the given parameters is 3.6 x 10^-10 Joules."
