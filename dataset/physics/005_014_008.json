    "message_1": "A particle of rest mass 2 GeV/c² is produced in a high-energy collision. It immediately decays into two daughter particles of equal mass. If the momentum of the parent particle was 6 GeV/c, what are the energies and momenta of the daughter particles, assuming they are massless?",
    "message_2": "Since the daughter particles are massless, they must be photons. Let's denote the energies of the two photons as E1 and E2, and their momenta as p1 and p2, respectively. The conservation of energy and momentum in the decay process requires that:\n\nE_parent = E1 + E2\np_parent = p1 + p2\n\nGiven that the parent particle has a rest mass of 2 GeV/c² and a momentum of 6 GeV/c, we can calculate its energy using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE_parent² = (m_parent * c²)² + (p_parent * c)²\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nE_parent² = (2 GeV)² + (6 GeV)²\nE_parent² = 4 GeV² + 36 GeV²\nE_parent² = 40 GeV²\nE_parent = sqrt(40) GeV\nE_parent ≈ 6.32 GeV\n\nNow, since the two photons have equal energies, we have:\n\nE1 = E2\nE_parent = 2 * E1\n6.32 GeV = 2 * E1\nE1 = E2 = 3.16 GeV\n\nFor massless particles like photons, their energy is equal to their momentum times the speed of light:\n\nE = p * c\n\nSince c = 1 in natural units, we have:\n\np1 = E1 = 3.16 GeV/c\np2 = E2 = 3.16 GeV/c\n\nSo, the energies and momenta of the two daughter particles (photons) are:\n\nE1 = E2 = 3.16 GeV\np1 = p2 = 3.16 GeV/c"
