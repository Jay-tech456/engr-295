    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nWe are given the focal length f = 10 cm and the object distance u = 20 cm. We can rearrange the lens formula to find the image distance v:\n\n1/v = 1/f + 1/u\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/20\n1/v = (2 + 1)/20\n1/v = 3/20\n\nNow, we can find v:\n\nv = 20/3 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -(20/3)/20\nM = -20/60\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is:\n\nM = -1/3\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, and the magnification is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object."
