What is the frequency of the emitted waves detected by the spaceship if the speed of the wave is 3 x 10^8 m/s? Use the relativistic Doppler effect formula to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f' is the observed frequency by the spaceship, f is the emitted frequency by the radio station, and β is the ratio of the spaceship's speed (v) to the speed of light (c).\n\nGiven:\nf = 100 MHz = 100 * 10^6 Hz\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find the value of β:\n\nβ = v / c = 0.8c / c = 0.8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\nf' = (100 * 10^6 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\nf' = (100 * 10^6 Hz) * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\nf' = (100 * 10^6 Hz) * sqrt(9)\nf' = (100 * 10^6 Hz) * 3\n\nf' = 300 * 10^6 Hz = 300 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the emitted waves detected by the spaceship is 300 MHz."
