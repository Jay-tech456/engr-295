    "message_2": "The gravitino is a hypothetical particle that arises in the context of supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. It is the supersymmetric partner of the graviton, the hypothetical particle that mediates the gravitational force. If dark matter is composed entirely of gravitinos, their mass and abundance should be consistent with current observations and constraints on dark matter.\n\nThe mass range of gravitinos is not well-constrained, as it depends on the specific supersymmetric model and the parameters involved. However, we can make some general statements about the mass range based on the requirement that gravitinos make up the observed dark matter abundance.\n\nThe relic abundance of gravitinos (i.e., the number of gravitinos per unit volume in the universe) is determined by the interplay between their production in the early universe and their decay. For gravitinos to make up the observed dark matter abundance, their lifetime must be longer than the age of the universe, which is about 13.8 billion years. This requirement puts an upper limit on the gravitino mass, as heavier gravitinos would decay more quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, the lower limit on the gravitino mass comes from the requirement that they are heavy enough to be non-relativistic (i.e., moving slowly compared to the speed of light) at the time of matter-radiation equality. This is necessary for gravitinos to act as cold dark matter, which is the type of dark matter favored by current observations. This requirement typically implies a lower limit on the gravitino mass of around a few keV (kilo-electron volts).\n\nTaking these constraints into account, the theoretical mass range of gravitinos that could make up the observed dark matter abundance is roughly between a few keV and a few TeV (tera-electron volts). However, this range is subject to uncertainties in the supersymmetric model parameters and the details of the early universe's thermal history. Further experimental and observational data, as well as refinements in theoretical models, are needed to narrow down this mass range and determine whether gravitinos are indeed the constituents of dark matter."
