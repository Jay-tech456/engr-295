    "message_2": "The predicted mass range of sterile neutrinos as the primary constituents of dark matter in the universe is not well-defined, as it depends on the specific model and assumptions made. However, a commonly discussed mass range is between a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to a few MeV (mega-electron volts). This range is motivated by the fact that lighter sterile neutrinos would not provide enough dark matter, while heavier ones would overclose the universe or be in conflict with other cosmological observations.\n\nDetecting sterile neutrinos is challenging due to their weak interactions with other particles. There are several proposed methods to detect them:\n\n1. X-ray observations: If sterile neutrinos are in the keV mass range, they can decay into a photon and an active neutrino. The emitted photon would have an energy in the X-ray range, which could be detected by X-ray observatories such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, or future missions like Athena. A signature of this decay would be a monochromatic X-ray line in the spectrum of galaxy clusters or other dark matter-dominated objects.\n\n2. Neutrino oscillations: Sterile neutrinos can mix with active neutrinos through a process called neutrino oscillation. This can lead to observable deviations from the standard three-neutrino oscillation pattern in experiments studying neutrino oscillations, such as reactor neutrino experiments, accelerator neutrino experiments, or solar neutrino detectors.\n\n3. Cosmological observations: The presence of sterile neutrinos can affect the evolution of the universe and the formation of large-scale structures. By studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and other cosmological observables, we can constrain the properties of sterile neutrinos and potentially detect their presence.\n\n4. Direct detection: Although challenging, it might be possible to directly detect sterile neutrinos in dedicated laboratory experiments. For example, if sterile neutrinos have a mass in the MeV range, they could be produced in electron-capture decays of certain isotopes and then be detected through their subsequent decay or scattering off other particles.\n\nDespite these efforts, no conclusive evidence for sterile neutrinos has been found so far. However, the search for these elusive particles continues, as they remain an intriguing candidate for dark matter and could help solve some of the outstanding mysteries in particle physics and cosmology."
