    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\nu = -20 cm (negative since the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60v to eliminate the fractions:\n\n4v = -3v + 60\n\nAdding 3v to both sides:\n\n7v = 60\n\nNow, divide by 7:\n\nv = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 cm\n\nThe image is formed approximately 8.57 cm in front of the mirror (positive value indicates it's a virtual image).\n\nNow, to find the magnification (m), we can use the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nm = -8.57 / -20\n\nm ≈ 0.428\n\nThe magnification of the image is approximately 0.428, which means the image is smaller than the object and is upright (since the magnification is positive)."
