    "message_2": "The minimum radius a star must have to become a neutron star is not a well-defined value, as it depends on the mass and composition of the star. However, neutron stars typically have radii of about 10-15 kilometers. The formation of a neutron star occurs when a massive star (usually with a mass between 1.4 and 3 solar masses) undergoes a supernova explosion, and its core collapses under the force of gravity. The protons and electrons in the core are squeezed together, forming neutrons and resulting in a highly dense object known as a neutron star.\n\nThe maximum possible rotation rate for a neutron star before centrifugal forces can rip it apart is determined by the balance between the gravitational force holding the star together and the centrifugal force trying to tear it apart. This is known as the mass-shedding limit or the Keplerian breakup frequency. For a typical neutron star with a mass of 1.4 solar masses and a radius of 10 kilometers, the maximum rotation rate is estimated to be around 1000-2000 rotations per second (Hz).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these values can vary depending on the specific properties of the neutron star, such as its mass, radius, and equation of state. The fastest known neutron star, PSR J1748-2446ad, rotates at a rate of about 716 Hz, which is still below the theoretical maximum."
