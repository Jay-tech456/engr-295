    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire loop is rectangular, we can break it down into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment separately, then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at point P.\n\nLet's define the coordinates of the four corners of the loop as A(2,3), B(-2,3), C(-2,-3), and D(2,-3). The point P is located at (0,0,3).\n\n1. Segment AB:\nThe differential length vector dl is along the -x direction, so dl = -dx i. The position vector r is given by r = x i + (3 - y) j + 3 k. Integrating the Biot-Savart Law along this segment:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[I * (-dx i) x (x i + (3 - y) j + 3 k)] / (x² + (3 - y)² + 3²)^(3/2) from x = -2 to x = 2\n\n2. Segment BC:\nThe differential length vector dl is along the -y direction, so dl = -dy j. The position vector r is given by r = (-2 - x) i + y j + 3 k. Integrating the Biot-Savart Law along this segment:\n\nB₂ = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[I * (-dy j) x ((-2 - x) i + y j + 3 k)] / ((-2 - x)² + y² + 3²)^(3/2) from y = -3 to y = 3\n\n3. Segment CD:\nThe differential length vector dl is along the x direction, so dl = dx i. The position vector r is given by r = x i + (-3 - y) j + 3 k. Integrating the Biot-Savart Law along this segment:\n\nB₃ = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[I * (dx i) x (x i + (-3 - y) j + 3 k)] / (x² + (-3 - y)² + 3²)^(3/2) from x = -2 to x = 2\n\n4. Segment DA:\nThe differential length vector dl is along the y direction, so dl = dy j. The position vector r is given by r = (2 - x) i + y j + 3 k. Integrating the Biot-Savart Law along this segment:\n\nB₄ = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[I * (dy j) x ((2 - x) i + y j + 3 k)] / ((2 - x)² + y² + 3²)^(3/2) from y = -3 to y = 3\n\nNow, we need to sum up the magnetic fields from all four segments:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the problem, the magnetic fields from segments AB and CD will cancel each other out in the x and y components, and the magnetic fields from segments BC and DA will cancel each other out in the x and y components as well. Therefore, we only need to consider the z-components of the magnetic fields.\n\nAfter calculating the integrals, we get:\n\nBz_total = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (2 * ∫[-dx / (x² + 9)^(3/2)] from x = -2 to x = 2 + 2 * ∫[dy / (y² + 13)^(3/2)] from y = -3 to y = 3)\n\nBz_total = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (2 * [-1/9 * (1/sqrt(1 + (2/3)²) - 1/sqrt(1 + (-2/3)²))] + 2 * [1/13 * (1/sqrt(1 + (3/13)²) - 1/sqrt(1 + (-3/13)²))])\n\nBz_total = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A / 4π) * (2 * [-1/9 * (1/sqrt(13/9) - 1/sqrt(5/9))] + 2 * [1/13 * (1/sqrt(169/169) - 1/sqrt(121/169))])\n\nBz_total = (10⁻⁶ T) * (2 * [-1/9 * (1/sqrt(13/9) - 1/sqrt(5/9))] + 2 * [1/13 * (1 - 1/sqrt(121/169))])\n\nBz_total ≈ 1.13 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.13 μT in the positive z-direction."
