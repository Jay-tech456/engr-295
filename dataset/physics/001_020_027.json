    "message_2": "Renormalization is a mathematical technique used in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and other quantum field theories to remove the infinities that arise in perturbation theory calculations. These infinities are a consequence of the interactions between particles and the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. In QED, renormalization is applied to the electron's mass, charge, and the coupling constant, which describes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction.\n\nThe process of renormalization involves the following steps:\n\n1. Divergent integrals: In perturbation theory, calculations of physical quantities often involve integrals that diverge, leading to infinite results. These infinities are considered unphysical, as they do not match experimental observations.\n\n2. Regularization: To handle these divergent integrals, a regularization method is introduced. This method involves introducing a cutoff parameter (such as an energy scale) that effectively limits the range of the integrals, making them finite. This allows for the calculations to be performed, but the results now depend on the arbitrary cutoff parameter.\n\n3. Renormalization: The next step is to absorb the dependence on the cutoff parameter into the redefinition of physical parameters, such as the electron's mass, charge, and the coupling constant. This is done by introducing \"bare\" quantities, which are the unobservable, unphysical parameters that include the infinities. The physical, observable quantities (renormalized quantities) are then expressed in terms of these bare quantities and the cutoff parameter.\n\n4. Removing the cutoff: After the renormalization process, the dependence on the cutoff parameter is canceled out in the final expressions for physical quantities. The cutoff can then be safely removed (taken to infinity), and the physical quantities are now finite and consistent with experimental observations.\n\nIn summary, renormalization in quantum electrodynamics is a technique used to reconcile the infinite values obtained in perturbation theory with the experimentally observed finite values. It involves regularizing divergent integrals, redefining physical parameters in terms of bare quantities and the cutoff parameter, and then removing the cutoff to obtain finite results that match experimental data. This process allows physicists to make accurate predictions and calculations in QED and other quantum field theories."
