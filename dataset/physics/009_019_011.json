    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit experiment, the distance between the central maximum and the first-order maximum (m = 1) can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the central maximum and first-order maximum (10 cm = 0.1 m)\nm = order of the maximum (1 for first-order maximum)\nλ = wavelength of light (600 nm = 6 * 10^-7 m)\nL = distance between the slits and the screen (1.5 m)\nd = distance between the two slits (which we need to find)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (m * λ * L) / y\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nd = (1 * 6 * 10^-7 * 1.5) / 0.1\nd = (9 * 10^-7) / 0.1\nd = 9 * 10^-6\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in Young's Double Slit experiment is 9 * 10^-6 meters, or 9 micrometers."
