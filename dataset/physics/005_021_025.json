    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the proton, we can use the formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.7c\n\nFirst, let's find the denominator of the equation:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.7c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.51) ≈ 2.33 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, let's find the proton's wavelength as detected by an observer on Earth. We can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the proton.\n\nThe momentum of the proton can be calculated using the formula:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass and v is the velocity of the proton.\n\np = (2.33 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.7c) ≈ 1.63 x 10^-27 kg * c\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (1.63 x 10^-27 kg * c)\n\nλ ≈ 4.07 x 10^-15 m\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton is approximately 2.33 x 10^-27 kg, and its wavelength as detected by an observer on Earth is approximately 4.07 x 10^-15 m."
