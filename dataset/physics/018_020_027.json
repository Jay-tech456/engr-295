    "message_2": "Dark Matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. The existence of Dark Matter has been inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, as well as on the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several experimental observations that provide evidence for the existence of Dark Matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that the mass distribution within galaxies does not follow the distribution of visible matter. The rotational speeds remain constant at large distances from the galactic center, which is inconsistent with the expected decrease in speed based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of Dark Matter surrounding the galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects indicate that there is more mass present in galaxy clusters than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to Dark Matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal information about the distribution of matter and energy in the early universe. The observed pattern of fluctuations is consistent with the presence of Dark Matter, which affects the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Simulations of the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, such as galaxy clusters and filaments, show that the presence of Dark Matter is necessary to reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe existence of Dark Matter challenges the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental particles and forces in the universe, because it does not include a particle that could account for the properties of Dark Matter. This suggests that there may be undiscovered particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model.\n\nCurrent efforts in high-energy physics to detect and identify Dark Matter can be broadly classified into three categories:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the interaction of Dark Matter particles with ordinary matter in highly sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Examples of direct detection experiments include the XENON, LUX, and SuperCDMS experiments.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of Dark Matter particle annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples of indirect detection experiments include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\n3. Collider experiments: High-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce Dark Matter particles in collisions between known particles. By studying the products of these collisions, physicists can search for signs of Dark Matter and other new particles beyond the Standard Model.\n\nDespite extensive experimental efforts, Dark Matter has not yet been directly detected or identified. The search for Dark Matter continues to be a major focus in high-energy physics and cosmology, as its discovery would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics."
