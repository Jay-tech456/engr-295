    "message_2": "To calculate the trajectory of a satellite orbiting a non-rotating Earth, we need to consider the effects of Earth's gravitational field as predicted by General Relativity. In General Relativity, gravity is described as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. The motion of a satellite in a gravitational field is described by the geodesic equation, which is derived from the principle of least action.\n\nThe spacetime metric for a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass (such as Earth) is given by the Schwarzschild metric:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r) c²dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Earth, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates (t is time, r is the radial distance from the center of Earth, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle).\n\nThe geodesic equation is given by:\n\nd²xᵃ/dτ² + Γᵃₘₙ dxᵐ/dτ dxⁿ/dτ = 0\n\nwhere xᵃ are the spacetime coordinates (t, r, θ, φ), τ is the proper time, and Γᵃₘₙ are the Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric tensor gₘₙ associated with the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nFor a satellite in orbit, we can assume that its motion is confined to a plane, so we can set θ = π/2 and dθ/dτ = 0. The remaining geodesic equations are:\n\n1. dt/dτ = E / (1 - 2GM/c²r)\n2. d²r/dτ² = (L²/r³) - GM(1 - 2GM/c²r) / r²\n3. dφ/dτ = L / r²\n\nwhere E and L are constants of motion related to the energy and angular momentum of the satellite, respectively.\n\nTo solve these equations, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method. We need to specify the initial conditions for the satellite, which include its initial position (r₀, φ₀) and initial velocity (dr/dτ|₀, dφ/dτ|₀). With these initial conditions, we can integrate the geodesic equations to obtain the trajectory of the satellite (r(τ), φ(τ)) as a function of proper time τ.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified model that assumes a non-rotating Earth and does not include other effects such as atmospheric drag or perturbations from other celestial bodies. For more accurate results, these factors should be taken into account."
