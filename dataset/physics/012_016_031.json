What parameters of the plasma treatment process need to be adjusted to achieve this result?",
    "message_2": "To selectively increase the hydrophilicity of a specific section of a polystyrene surface using plasma-based surface modification techniques, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Masking: First, you need to protect the areas of the polystyrene surface that you do not want to modify. You can achieve this by using a masking material, such as a metal mask or a removable polymer film, to cover the areas you want to keep unchanged. Make sure the mask is well-adhered to the surface to prevent plasma penetration in the masked areas.\n\n2. Plasma treatment: Next, you need to perform plasma treatment on the exposed section of the polystyrene surface. The most common plasma gases used for increasing hydrophilicity are oxygen (O2) and air. These gases will introduce polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and carboxyl (-COOH) groups, to the surface, thus increasing its hydrophilicity.\n\n3. Adjusting plasma parameters: To achieve the desired level of hydrophilicity, you need to adjust the following plasma treatment parameters:\n\n   a. Gas composition: As mentioned earlier, using oxygen or air plasma will help increase hydrophilicity. You can also use a mixture of gases, such as oxygen and argon, to fine-tune the surface properties.\n\n   b. Power: The power of the plasma system affects the density of reactive species generated in the plasma. Higher power levels will lead to more reactive species and a higher degree of surface modification. However, be cautious not to use excessive power, as it may cause damage to the polystyrene surface.\n\n   c. Pressure: The pressure of the plasma chamber affects the mean free path of the reactive species. Lower pressures result in a higher mean free path, which can lead to more uniform surface modification.\n\n   d. Treatment time: The duration of the plasma treatment will also affect the degree of surface modification. Longer treatment times will result in more functional groups being introduced to the surface, increasing hydrophilicity. However, excessive treatment times may cause surface damage or over-modification.\n\n4. Removing the mask: After the plasma treatment, carefully remove the masking material from the polystyrene surface. The masked areas should remain unchanged, while the exposed section should now exhibit increased hydrophilicity.\n\n5. Characterization: To confirm the success of the selective surface modification, you can use various surface characterization techniques, such as contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), to analyze the surface properties before and after plasma treatment.\n\nBy following these steps and adjusting the plasma treatment parameters, you can selectively increase the hydrophilicity of a specific section of a polystyrene surface without affecting the rest of the surface's properties."
