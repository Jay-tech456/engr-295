    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for the frequency observed by an observer on Earth:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_emitted is the frequency of the light emitted by the spaceship (500 THz), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's convert the velocity of the spaceship to m/s:\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = 500 THz * sqrt((1 + 2.4 x 10^8 m/s / 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (1 - 2.4 x 10^8 m/s / 3.0 x 10^8 m/s))\n\nf_observed = 500 THz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = 500 THz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_observed = 500 THz * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = 500 THz * 3\n\nf_observed = 1500 THz\n\nSo, an observer on Earth would detect a frequency of 1500 THz."
