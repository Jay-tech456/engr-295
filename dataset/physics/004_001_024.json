    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency of the gravitational waves produced by two black holes orbiting each other, we can use the following equation derived from General Relativity:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * M / r^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system, and r is the distance between the two black holes.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass (M☉) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 30 M☉ = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 25 M☉ = 25 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 4.9725 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe total mass of the system (M) is the sum of the masses of the two black holes:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 5.967 x 10^31 kg + 4.9725 x 10^31 kg = 10.9395 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the black holes from kilometers to meters:\n\nr = 500 km = 500 * 10^3 m = 5 x 10^5 m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * M / r^3)^(1/2)\nf = (1 / π) * ((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (10.9395 x 10^31 kg) / (5 x 10^5 m)^3)^(1/2)\n\nf ≈ (1 / π) * (7.301 x 10^21 / 1.25 x 10^17)^(1/2)\nf ≈ (1 / π) * (58.408)^(1/2)\nf ≈ (1 / π) * 7.64 Hz\n\nThe expected frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the two black holes orbiting each other at a distance of 500 km before they merge is approximately 7.64 Hz / π ≈ 2.43 Hz."
