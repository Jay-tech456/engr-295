    "message_2": "The theoretical mass range of primordial black holes (PBHs) that can potentially account for the observed dark matter in the universe is quite broad, spanning from extremely small masses (around 10^-8 solar masses) to thousands of solar masses. Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations in the first moments after the Big Bang.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that PBHs with masses between 10^-10 and 10^-8 solar masses could account for a significant fraction of dark matter. However, observational constraints from various astrophysical and cosmological observations have ruled out a large portion of the mass range for PBHs as the dominant component of dark matter. For example, PBHs with masses between 10^-16 and 10^-11 solar masses are constrained by the cosmic microwave background radiation, while PBHs with masses between 10^-8 and 1 solar mass are constrained by microlensing observations.\n\nOn the other hand, black holes formed from stellar collapse, also known as astrophysical black holes, typically have masses in the range of a few to a few tens of solar masses. These black holes form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo gravitational collapse. The mass range of astrophysical black holes is much narrower than that of primordial black holes, and they are not considered as a viable candidate for dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the mass range of primordial black holes that could potentially account for the observed dark matter in the universe is quite broad, but many regions of this range have been ruled out by observational constraints. The mass range of black holes formed from stellar collapse is much narrower and not considered a viable candidate for dark matter."
