    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop due to the current flowing through it:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 0.2 meters and the current I = 0.5 Ampere, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.5 A) / (2 * 0.2 m)\nB = (2π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.2 m)\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-7) T / 0.2 m\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 1.57 × 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current (assuming the loop is in the xy-plane and the current is flowing counterclockwise), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing in the positive z-direction (out of the plane of the loop)."
