    "message_2": "The energy levels of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the ground state (n=1), the energy is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the first excited state (n=2), the energy is:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is:\n\nΔE = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nWhen an electron transitions from the first excited state to the ground state, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the two states. The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_photon = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the wavelength of the photon:\n\nλ = h * c / E_photon\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\nΔE_J = 10.2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.634 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength of the photon:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.634 x 10^-18 J) = 1.215 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from the first excited state to the ground state is approximately 1.215 x 10^-7 m, or 121.5 nm. This photon is in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum."
