    "message_2": "To find the total relativistic energy of the particle, we can use the equation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere E is the total relativistic energy, m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass from grams to kilograms:\n\nmass = 2 g = 0.002 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nE = (0.002 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) / sqrt(1 - (0.9 * (3 x 10^8 m/s))^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nE ≈ (0.002 kg * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)) / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nE ≈ (1.8 x 10^14 J) / sqrt(0.19)\nE ≈ 1.8 x 10^14 J / 0.43589\nE ≈ 4.13 x 10^14 J\n\nSo, the total relativistic energy of the particle is approximately 4.13 x 10^14 Joules.\n\nTo find the momentum of the particle, we can use the equation:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere p is the momentum, m is the rest mass of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nUsing the same mass and velocity values as before, we can plug them into the equation:\n\np = (0.002 kg * 0.9 * (3 x 10^8 m/s)) / sqrt(1 - (0.9 * (3 x 10^8 m/s))^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\np ≈ (0.002 kg * 2.7 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\np ≈ 5.4 x 10^8 kg*m/s / sqrt(0.19)\np ≈ 5.4 x 10^8 kg*m/s / 0.43589\np ≈ 1.238 x 10^9 kg*m/s\n\nSo, the momentum of the particle is approximately 1.238 x 10^9 kg*m/s."
