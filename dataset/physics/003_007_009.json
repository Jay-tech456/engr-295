    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm away from the center of the rod that is perpendicular to the rod's axis, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, r is the vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nIn this case, we have a straight wire, so we can simplify the Biot-Savart Law by integrating over the length of the wire. The magnetic field at a perpendicular distance R from the center of the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πR) * ∫(dx / (x² + R²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere x is the distance along the wire, and the integral is taken from -L/2 to L/2 (L is the length of the wire).\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nI = 3 A\nR = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ∫(dx / (x² + (0.02 m)²)^(3/2)), where the integral is taken from -0.05 m to 0.05 m.\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a substitution method. Let x = 0.02 * tan(θ), then dx = 0.02 * sec²(θ) dθ. The limits of integration will be from -arctan(2.5) to arctan(2.5).\n\nNow the integral becomes:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ∫(0.02 * sec²(θ) dθ / ((0.02 * tan(θ))² + (0.02 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nThe (0.02 m)² terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ∫(sec²(θ) dθ / (sec²(θ))^(3/2))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ∫(dθ / sec(θ))\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to θ:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * [ln|sec(θ) + tan(θ)|] from -arctan(2.5) to arctan(2.5)\n\nEvaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * (ln|sec(arctan(2.5)) + tan(arctan(2.5))| - ln|sec(-arctan(2.5)) + tan(-arctan(2.5))|)\n\nSince sec(arctan(x)) = sqrt(x^2 + 1) and tan(arctan(x)) = x, we can simplify further:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * (ln|(sqrt(2.5^2 + 1) + 2.5)| - ln|(sqrt(2.5^2 + 1) - 2.5)|)\n\nNow, we can combine the logarithms:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ln|((sqrt(2.5^2 + 1) + 2.5) / (sqrt(2.5^2 + 1) - 2.5))|\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB ≈ (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) * ln|(6.5 / 0.5)| ≈ 3.0 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm away from the center of the rod that is perpendicular to the rod's axis is approximately 3.0 × 10^(-5) T."
