    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of a 0.5 molal aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law. The Debye-Hückel limiting law is given by:\n\nlog10(γ±) = -0.509 * Z+ * Z- * sqrt(I)\n\nwhere γ± is the mean activity coefficient, Z+ and Z- are the charges of the cation and anion, and I is the ionic strength of the solution.\n\nFor NaCl, the charges of the cation (Na+) and anion (Cl-) are both 1. The ionic strength (I) is given as 1.2 mol/L.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Debye-Hückel limiting law equation:\n\nlog10(γ±) = -0.509 * 1 * 1 * sqrt(1.2)\n\nlog10(γ±) = -0.509 * sqrt(1.2)\n\nlog10(γ±) ≈ -0.56\n\nNow, we can find the activity coefficient (γ±) by taking the antilog:\n\nγ± = 10^(-0.56)\n\nγ± ≈ 0.27\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of a 0.5 molal aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is approximately 0.27.\n\nThe significance of the activity coefficient in this context is that it provides a measure of how the actual behavior of ions in the solution deviates from the ideal behavior. An activity coefficient of 1 indicates ideal behavior, while an activity coefficient less than 1 indicates that the ions are interacting with each other and the solvent more strongly than expected for an ideal solution. In this case, the activity coefficient of 0.27 suggests that the Na+ and Cl- ions in the 0.5 molal NaCl solution are experiencing significant interactions with each other and the solvent, leading to a deviation from ideal behavior."
