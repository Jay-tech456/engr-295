    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question that a physics student can solve related to Cosmic ray propagation and acceleration:\n\nWhat acceleration is required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 1 TeV, assuming it originates from a supernova remnant shock wave with a magnetic field of 100 microgauss?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the acceleration required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 1 TeV, we can use the equation for the energy of a charged particle in a magnetic field:\n\nE = q * B * R\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle, q is the charge of the particle, B is the magnetic field strength, and R is the gyroradius of the particle's trajectory.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given energy from TeV to Joules. 1 TeV = 1 x 10^12 eV, and 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J. Therefore, 1 TeV = 1.6 x 10^-7 J.\n\nNow, let's assume the cosmic ray particle is a proton, which has a charge of q = 1.6 x 10^-19 C. The magnetic field strength is given as B = 100 microgauss = 10^-8 T.\n\nWe can rearrange the energy equation to solve for the gyroradius R:\n\nR = E / (q * B)\n\nR = (1.6 x 10^-7 J) / (1.6 x 10^-19 C * 10^-8 T) = 1 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, we can use the centripetal acceleration formula to find the acceleration required:\n\na = v^2 / R\n\nwhere a is the acceleration and v is the velocity of the particle. We can relate the velocity to the energy using the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the particle (proton mass, m = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg), and c is the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe can solve for γ:\n\nγ = E / (m * c^2) + 1 = (1.6 x 10^-7 J) / (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2) + 1 ≈ 1.07\n\nNow, we can find the velocity using the Lorentz factor:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)) ≈ 0.29 * c ≈ 8.7 x 10^7 m/s\n\nFinally, we can calculate the acceleration:\n\na = (8.7 x 10^7 m/s)^2 / (1 x 10^4 m) ≈ 7.56 x 10^11 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 1 TeV in a 100 microgauss magnetic field is approximately 7.56 x 10^11 m/s²."
