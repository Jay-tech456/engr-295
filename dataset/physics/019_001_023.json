    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the scattering amplitude for two electrons at high energies can be calculated using the Feynman rules approach in third-order perturbation theory. The process involves the exchange of virtual photons between the electrons. The third-order perturbation theory includes the first-order (tree-level) and second-order (one-loop) diagrams.\n\nThe scattering amplitude is given by the sum of all possible Feynman diagrams for the process. In the third-order perturbation theory, we need to consider the following diagrams:\n\n1. The first-order (tree-level) diagram, which involves a single virtual photon exchange between the two electrons.\n2. The second-order (one-loop) diagrams, which involve one-loop corrections to the photon propagator and the electron-photon vertex.\n\nThe first-order diagram contributes to the scattering amplitude as:\n\nM^(1) = -i e^2 u_bar(p2) γ^μ u(p1) D_μν(q) u_bar(p4) γ^ν u(p3),\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, p1 and p2 are the initial electron momenta, p3 and p4 are the final electron momenta, γ^μ and γ^ν are the Dirac gamma matrices, and D_μν(q) is the photon propagator.\n\nThe second-order diagrams contribute to the scattering amplitude as:\n\nM^(2) = -i e^4 u_bar(p2) γ^μ u(p1) D_μν(q) Π^νρ(q) D_ρσ(q) u_bar(p4) γ^σ u(p3),\n\nwhere Π^νρ(q) is the sum of all one-loop corrections to the photon propagator.\n\nThe total scattering amplitude in third-order perturbation theory is given by the sum of the first-order and second-order contributions:\n\nM = M^(1) + M^(2).\n\nTo calculate the scattering amplitude, one needs to evaluate the photon propagator D_μν(q), the one-loop corrections Π^νρ(q), and the Dirac spinors u(p) and u_bar(p) for the initial and final electron states. The scattering amplitude can then be used to compute the differential and total cross-sections for the electron-electron scattering process at high energies."
