    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the scattering amplitude of two particles can be calculated using the Feynman diagrams and the corresponding mathematical expressions. In this case, we are considering the scattering of two electrons with an initial energy of 10 GeV each, and they scatter at an angle of 45 degrees. The dominant interaction between electrons is the electromagnetic interaction, which is mediated by the exchange of a virtual photon. Therefore, we will use the QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) formalism to calculate the scattering amplitude.\n\nFirst, let's draw the Feynman diagram for this process. There are two possible diagrams for this process, which are called t-channel and u-channel diagrams. In both diagrams, the incoming electrons exchange a virtual photon and then scatter off at an angle of 45 degrees.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for this process can be calculated using the Feynman rules for QED. The relevant rules for this process are:\n\n1. For each incoming and outgoing electron, assign a spinor u(p) or v(p) for particles and u-bar(p) or v-bar(p) for antiparticles, where p is the momentum of the electron.\n2. For each vertex where an electron emits or absorbs a photon, assign a factor of -ieγ^μ, where e is the electron charge, and γ^μ is the gamma matrix.\n3. For each internal photon line, assign a factor of -g^μν/(q^2 + iε), where g^μν is the metric tensor, q is the momentum of the photon, and ε is a small positive number to ensure the correct analytic properties of the amplitude.\n\nNow, let's calculate the scattering amplitude for the t-channel diagram. The amplitude can be written as:\n\nM_t = u_bar(p3) (-ieγ^μ) u(p1) (-g^μν/(q^2 + iε)) u_bar(p4) (-ieγ^ν) u(p2),\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the momenta of the incoming electrons, p3 and p4 are the momenta of the outgoing electrons, and q = p1 - p3 is the momentum of the virtual photon.\n\nSimilarly, the scattering amplitude for the u-channel diagram can be written as:\n\nM_u = u_bar(p3) (-ieγ^μ) u(p2) (-g^μν/(q'^2 + iε)) u_bar(p4) (-ieγ^ν) u(p1),\n\nwhere q' = p1 - p4 is the momentum of the virtual photon in the u-channel diagram.\n\nThe total scattering amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for the t-channel and u-channel diagrams:\n\nM = M_t + M_u.\n\nTo calculate the differential cross-section, we need to square the scattering amplitude and average over the initial spins and sum over the final spins:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1/4) ∑_spins |M|^2 / (64π^2 s),\n\nwhere s = (p1 + p2)^2 is the Mandelstam variable, which is related to the center-of-mass energy of the system.\n\nNow, we have all the ingredients to calculate the scattering amplitude and the differential cross-section. However, the actual calculation involves some non-trivial algebra and the evaluation of traces of gamma matrices. This is typically done using specialized software packages like FeynCalc or FORM.\n\nOnce the calculation is done, we can plug in the given values for the initial energy (10 GeV) and the scattering angle (45 degrees) to obtain the numerical value for the scattering amplitude and the differential cross-section."
