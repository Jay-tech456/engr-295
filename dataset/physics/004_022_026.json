    "message_2": "To calculate the duration of a gravitational wave emitted by a neutron star, we need to know the energy emitted by the neutron star in the form of gravitational waves and the power radiated as gravitational waves. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the moment of inertia (I) of the neutron star, which can be approximated as a solid sphere:\n\nI = (2/5) * M * R^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the neutron star and R is its radius. We are given the mass in solar masses, so we need to convert it to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nM = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 2.785 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the moment of inertia:\n\nI ≈ (2/5) * (2.785 x 10^30 kg) * (10,000 m)^2 ≈ 1.114 x 10^45 kg m^2\n\nNext, we need to calculate the angular frequency (ω) of the neutron star, which is related to the given frequency (f) by:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nω ≈ 2π * 100 Hz ≈ 628.32 rad/s\n\nNow we can calculate the power (P) radiated as gravitational waves, using the formula:\n\nP = (32/5) * (G/c^5) * I^2 * ω^6\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nP ≈ (32/5) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^5 * (1.114 x 10^45 kg m^2)^2 * (628.32 rad/s)^6 ≈ 1.56 x 10^27 W\n\nTo find the duration of the gravitational wave, we need to know the energy emitted by the neutron star in the form of gravitational waves. This energy can be estimated as a fraction of the total rotational energy of the neutron star:\n\nE_grav = ε * E_rot\n\nwhere ε is the efficiency factor, which is typically of the order of 10^-4 to 10^-6 for neutron stars, and E_rot is the rotational energy of the neutron star, given by:\n\nE_rot = (1/2) * I * ω^2\n\nLet's assume an efficiency factor ε = 10^-5 and calculate the rotational energy:\n\nE_rot ≈ (1/2) * (1.114 x 10^45 kg m^2) * (628.32 rad/s)^2 ≈ 2.20 x 10^47 J\n\nNow we can calculate the energy emitted as gravitational waves:\n\nE_grav ≈ 10^-5 * 2.20 x 10^47 J ≈ 2.20 x 10^42 J\n\nFinally, we can find the duration (t) of the gravitational wave by dividing the energy emitted by the power radiated:\n\nt = E_grav / P\n\nt ≈ (2.20 x 10^42 J) / (1.56 x 10^27 W) ≈ 1.41 x 10^15 s\n\nSo the duration of the gravitational wave emitted by the neutron star is approximately 1.41 x 10^15 seconds. Note that this is a rough estimate, as the actual duration may depend on various factors such as the neutron star's equation of state, magnetic field, and other astrophysical processes."
