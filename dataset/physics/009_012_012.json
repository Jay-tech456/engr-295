    "message_2": "To determine the size of the image produced on the screen, we first need to find the magnification of the lens. We can do this by using the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 40 cm\nv = 30 cm (since the screen is placed 30 cm from the lens)\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n1/20 = 1/40 + 1/30\n\nTo solve for the magnification (M), we use the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging the values into the magnification formula:\nM = -30/40\nM = -0.75\n\nThe magnification is -0.75, which means the image is inverted and 0.75 times the size of the object. To find the size of the image, we need to know the size of the object. Let's assume the object has a height (h_o) of 10 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the magnification formula relating object height (h_o) and image height (h_i):\nM = h_i/h_o\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n-0.75 = h_i/10\n\nSolving for h_i:\nh_i = -0.75 * 10\nh_i = -7.5 cm\n\nThe size of the image produced on the screen is 7.5 cm, and it is inverted (indicated by the negative sign)."
