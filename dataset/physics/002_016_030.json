    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of nitrogen, we can use the critical constants and the van der Waals equation of state. The van der Waals equation is given by:\n\n(P + a * (n/V)²) * (V - n * b) = n * R * T\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nAt the critical point, we can define the reduced variables as follows:\n\nPc = a / (27 * b²)\nVc = 3 * b\nTc = 8 * a / (27 * b * R)\n\nWe are given the critical pressure (Pc) and critical volume (Vc), and we need to find the critical temperature (Tc). First, let's find the van der Waals constants a and b using the given critical constants.\n\nFrom the equation for Pc:\n\na = 27 * b² * Pc\n\nFrom the equation for Vc:\n\nb = Vc / 3\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of b from the second equation into the first equation:\n\na = 27 * (Vc / 3)² * Pc\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for Pc and Vc:\n\nPc = 3.40 MPa = 3.40 * 10^6 Pa\nVc = 33.6 cm³/mol = 33.6 * 10^(-6) m³/mol\n\na = 27 * (33.6 * 10^(-6) / 3)² * (3.40 * 10^6)\na ≈ 0.1377 J m³/mol²\n\nNow, we can find the value of b:\n\nb = 33.6 * 10^(-6) / 3\nb ≈ 1.12 * 10^(-5) m³/mol\n\nFinally, we can find the critical temperature (Tc) using the equation for Tc:\n\nTc = 8 * a / (27 * b * R)\n\nThe gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol*K). Plugging in the values for a, b, and R:\n\nTc = 8 * 0.1377 / (27 * 1.12 * 10^(-5) * 8.314)\nTc ≈ 126.2 K\n\nSo, the critical temperature of nitrogen is approximately 126.2 K."
