    "message_1": "A flat plate of thickness 10mm is placed in a fluid stream moving at a velocity of 10 m/s. Using boundary layer theory, determine the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 50mm from the leading edge of the plate. The fluid has a viscosity of 0.1 Pa.s and a density of 1000 kg/m³. (Assume that the flow is steady and two-dimensional and neglect any other effects.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 50mm from the leading edge of the plate, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate. The Blasius solution gives the following expression for the boundary layer thickness (δ):\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U₀)^(1/2))\n\nwhere:\n- δ is the boundary layer thickness\n- x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate (50mm in this case)\n- ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, which can be calculated as the dynamic viscosity (μ) divided by the fluid density (ρ): ν = μ / ρ\n- U₀ is the free-stream velocity of the fluid (10 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the kinematic viscosity (ν):\n\nν = μ / ρ\nν = 0.1 Pa.s / 1000 kg/m³\nν = 0.0001 m²/s\n\nNow we can calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ) at a distance of 50mm (0.05m) from the leading edge of the plate:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.05m * (0.0001 m²/s / 10 m/s)^(1/2))\nδ = (5 * 0.05m * (0.00001 m)^(1/2))\nδ = (5 * 0.05m * 0.00316m)\nδ ≈ 0.00079 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 50mm from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.00079 meters or 0.79 millimeters."
