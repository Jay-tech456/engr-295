    "message_2": "To find the fraction of the original intensity of the light beam that passes through the filter, we can use Malus' law. Malus' law states that the intensity of light after passing through a polarizing filter is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity after passing through the filter, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the polarization direction of the light and the axis of the polarizing filter.\n\nIn this case, the angle θ is 45 degrees. To find the fraction of the original intensity, we can plug in the values into Malus' law:\n\nFraction = cos²(45°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 45 degrees:\n\ncos(45°) = √2 / 2\n\nNow, we can square the cosine value:\n\nFraction = (√2 / 2)² = (2 / 4) = 1 / 2\n\nSo, the fraction of the original intensity of the light beam that passes through the filter is 1/2 or 50%."
