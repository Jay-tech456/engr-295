(Assume that the mass of each deuterium nucleus is 2.01410 atomic mass units and that the released energy is equal to the difference in mass before and after the fusion.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the fusion of two deuterium nuclei, we first need to find the difference in mass before and after the fusion.\n\nMass of two deuterium nuclei = 2 * 2.01410 atomic mass units = 4.02820 atomic mass units\nMass of helium nucleus = 3.01603 atomic mass units\n\nDifference in mass = 4.02820 - 3.01603 = 1.01217 atomic mass units\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, to convert the mass difference into energy. First, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units to kilograms.\n\n1 atomic mass unit = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg\n\nMass difference in kg = 1.01217 * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg = 1.68156 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can plug this mass difference into the equation, using the speed of light (c = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s):\n\nE = (1.68156 x 10^-27 kg) * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.68156 x 10^-27 kg * 8.987 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.510 x 10^-10 Joules\n\nSo, the amount of energy released in the fusion of two deuterium nuclei to form a helium nucleus is approximately 1.510 x 10^-10 Joules."
