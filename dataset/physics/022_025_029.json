    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly.\n\nDark radiation is a hypothetical form of radiation that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is sometimes considered as a possible component of dark matter. However, current scientific evidence and theories suggest that dark matter is more likely to be composed of particles rather than radiation.\n\nThe most widely accepted hypothesis for the composition of dark matter is that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). These particles would only interact through gravity and the weak nuclear force, making them difficult to detect. Experiments are ongoing to search for WIMPs, but so far, no direct detection has been made.\n\nOn the other hand, dark radiation is not considered a likely candidate for dark matter because it would not have the same gravitational effects as observed in the universe. Radiation pressure would cause dark radiation to disperse, making it difficult to form the large-scale structures and galaxy clusters that we observe.\n\nBased on current scientific evidence and theories, the likelihood that dark matter is composed of dark radiation is considered to be low. The majority of the scientific community supports the WIMP hypothesis or other particle-based dark matter candidates, such as axions or sterile neutrinos. However, it is important to note that our understanding of dark matter is still incomplete, and future discoveries could potentially change our perspective on its composition."
