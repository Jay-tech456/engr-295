    "message_2": "The observed effect of a black hole's gravitational lensing on the path of light passing through its vicinity is that the light appears to be bent or distorted. This phenomenon occurs because the immense gravity of the black hole warps the spacetime around it, causing the light to follow a curved path as it travels through the distorted spacetime.\n\nAs a result, an observer looking at a light source behind a black hole would see the light source's image distorted into a ring-like shape, known as an \"Einstein ring.\" This effect can also lead to multiple images of the same object, as light from the object takes different paths around the black hole before reaching the observer.\n\nGravitational lensing can also cause the light from distant objects to be magnified, making them appear brighter and larger than they would be without the lensing effect. This phenomenon has been used by astronomers to study distant galaxies and other celestial objects that would otherwise be too faint to observe."
