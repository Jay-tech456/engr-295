    "message_2": "The frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger can be estimated using the quadrupole formula. However, it is important to note that the frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency of the merging neutron stars.\n\nGiven that the orbital frequency of the neutron stars is 1 kHz, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger would be:\n\nf_gravitational_waves = 2 * f_orbital\nf_gravitational_waves = 2 * 1 kHz\nf_gravitational_waves = 2,000 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger with a mass of 1.4 solar masses and an orbital frequency of 1 kHz is approximately 2,000 Hz or 2 kHz."
