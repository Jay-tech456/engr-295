    "message_2": "Electrical conductivity (σ) is the reciprocal of resistivity (ρ). The formula to find the electrical conductivity is:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nGiven the resistivity of pure copper (ρ) is 1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm at 300 K, we can find the electrical conductivity using the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm)\n\nσ ≈ 5.95 x 10^7 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of pure copper at a temperature of 300 K is approximately 5.95 x 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)."
