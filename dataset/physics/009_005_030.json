    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image from the mirror and the magnification of the reflected image, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = 10 cm and u = -20 cm (negative sign because the object is placed on the left side of the mirror).\n\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20v, we get:\n\n2v = -v + 20v\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n3v = 20\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\nv = 20/3 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is approximately 6.67 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = - (20/3) / (-20)\n\nM = (20/3) / 20\n\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification of the reflected image is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object and inverted."
