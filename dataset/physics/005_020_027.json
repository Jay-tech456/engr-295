    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth with a speed of 0.85c. A radio beacon on the spaceship is transmitting a 150 MHz radio wave. What is the frequency of the radio wave observed by the Earth-based radio station?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for frequency:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency on Earth, f_source is the frequency of the radio wave transmitted by the spaceship (150 MHz), v is the speed of the spaceship (0.85c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 150 MHz * sqrt((1 + 0.85) / (1 - 0.85))\n\nf_observed = 150 MHz * sqrt(1.85 / 0.15)\n\nf_observed = 150 MHz * sqrt(12.3333)\n\nf_observed ≈ 150 MHz * 3.512\n\nf_observed ≈ 527.8 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the radio wave observed by the Earth-based radio station is approximately 527.8 MHz."
