    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the n=2 and n=4 states of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=2 state:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=4 state:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / 4^2 = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the n=2 and n=4 states is:\n\nΔE = E_4 - E_2 = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from the n=4 to n=2 state using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nΔE = 2.55 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 4.085 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / ΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.085 x 10^-19 J) = 4.867 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from the n=4 to n=2 state is approximately 4.867 x 10^-7 m or 486.7 nm."
