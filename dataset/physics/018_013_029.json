    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy released in the supernova explosion, we first need to determine the mass that was blown away during the explosion. The core's original mass was 3 solar masses, and the resulting neutron star has a mass of 1 solar mass. Therefore, the mass blown away is:\n\n3 solar masses - 1 solar mass = 2 solar masses\n\nNow we can use Einstein's equation E=mc² to calculate the energy released. First, we need to convert the mass from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, 2 solar masses is:\n\n2 x 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug this mass into the equation, using the speed of light (c) which is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s:\n\nE = (3.978 x 10^30 kg) x (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nE = 3.978 x 10^30 kg x 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nE = 3.5802 x 10^47 kg m^2/s^2\n\nE = 3.5802 x 10^47 Joules\n\nSo, the amount of energy released in the supernova explosion is approximately 3.5802 x 10^47 Joules."
