    "message_2": "To find the angle of deflection for a relativistic electron scattering off an atomic nucleus, we can use the relativistic Rutherford scattering formula. The differential cross-section for relativistic Rutherford scattering is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α * Z₁ * Z₂ * ħc / 2 * E₀² * sin^4(θ/2))² * (1 / (1 + (E₀ / m₀c²) * (1 - cosθ)))\n\nHere, α is the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137), Z₁ and Z₂ are the charge numbers of the electron and nucleus, ħc is the reduced Planck constant times the speed of light (approximately 197 MeV*fm), E₀ is the initial energy of the electron, m₀c² is the rest mass energy of the electron, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven the initial energy E₀ = 10 GeV = 10,000 MeV, the mass of the electron m₀c² = 0.511 MeV, the charge number of the nucleus Z₂ = 79, and the incident angle θ = 30 degrees, we can find the angle of deflection by solving for θ in the above equation.\n\nFirst, let's convert the incident angle to radians: θ = 30° * (π/180) ≈ 0.524 radians.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1/137 * 1 * 79 * 197 / (2 * 10000² * sin^4(0.524/2)))² * (1 / (1 + (10000 / 0.511) * (1 - cos(0.524))))\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 1.31 * 10^(-6) sr^(-1)\n\nTo find the angle of deflection, we need to find the maximum of the differential cross-section with respect to θ. This can be done by taking the derivative of dσ/dΩ with respect to θ and setting it to zero, then solving for θ. However, this is a complex task and requires numerical methods to solve.\n\nAlternatively, one can use computational tools or software to find the maximum of the differential cross-section and the corresponding angle of deflection. The angle of deflection will depend on the specific scattering event and the properties of the interacting particles."
