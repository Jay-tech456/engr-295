    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a disc with a given radius and current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and x is the distance from the center of the disc (in this case, x = 0 since we want the magnetic field at the center).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR = 0.5 m\nI = 2.5 A\nx = 0\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A * (0.5 m)²) / (2 * (0.5 m² + 0²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A * 0.25 m²) / (2 * (0.25 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (π × 10^(-6) T·m² * 2.5) / (0.5)\n\nB = (2.5π × 10^(-6) T·m²) / (0.5)\n\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the disc is approximately 1.57 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
