    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity (c) of the copper block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in Joules), m is the mass of the object (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given:\nQ = 1000 J\nm = 250 g\nΔT = 40°C - 20°C = 20°C\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 1000 J / (250 g × 20°C)\nc = 1000 J / 5000 g°C\nc = 0.2 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the copper block is 0.2 J/g°C."
