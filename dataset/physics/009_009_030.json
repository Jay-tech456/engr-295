    "message_2": "1. To determine the position of the image formed, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 15 cm and object distance u = -30 cm (negative because the object is in front of the mirror), we can solve for v:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying through by 30v, we get:\n\n2v = -v^2\n\nRearranging and solving for v, we find:\n\nv^2 - 2v = 0\nv(v - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: v = 0 or v = 2. However, v = 0 doesn't make physical sense, as it would mean the image is formed at the mirror's surface. So, we take v = 2 cm as the position of the image formed.\n\n2. To find the magnification of the image, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found earlier, we get:\n\nmagnification = -2/(-30) = 1/15\n\nSo, the magnification of the image is 1/15, meaning the image is smaller than the object.\n\n3. Since the image distance v is positive, the image is real (formed on the same side as the object). Also, the magnification is positive, which means the image is upright."
