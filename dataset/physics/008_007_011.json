    "message_2": "The current measurements of the masses of the W and Z bosons are as follows:\n\n- W boson mass: approximately 80.379 GeV/c²\n- Z boson mass: approximately 91.1876 GeV/c²\n\nThese values are determined through experiments conducted at particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In these experiments, high-energy protons are collided, producing a variety of particles, including W and Z bosons. The bosons are unstable and decay rapidly into other particles, which are then detected by the particle detectors.\n\nThe masses of the W and Z bosons can be calculated by analyzing the energy and momentum of the decay products. This is done using the principle of conservation of energy and momentum, as well as the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E² = (mc²)² + (pc)²), where E is the energy, m is the mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nBy measuring the energies and momenta of the decay products and applying these principles, physicists can reconstruct the invariant mass of the parent particle (W or Z boson). By analyzing a large number of such events, they can determine the mass of the W and Z bosons with high precision. The uncertainties in these measurements are due to experimental uncertainties and statistical fluctuations in the data."
