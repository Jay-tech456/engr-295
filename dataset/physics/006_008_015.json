    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - Φ\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron, E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, and Φ is the work function of the material (sodium in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy of the incident photon. We can do this using the equation:\n\nE_photon = (h * c) / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J.s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon (450 nm).\n\nBefore we plug in the values, let's convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ = 450 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 4.5 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the photon:\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^-34 J.s * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.5 x 10^-7 m) = 4.416 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo make it easier to work with, let's convert the energy of the photon from joules to electron volts (eV):\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nE_photon = (4.416 x 10^-19 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.756 eV\n\nNow, we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron:\n\nK_max = E_photon - Φ = 2.756 eV - 2.28 eV = 0.476 eV\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron when a photon with a wavelength of 450 nm is incident on a sodium atom is 0.476 eV."
