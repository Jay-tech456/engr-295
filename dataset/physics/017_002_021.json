    "message_2": "The relationship between temperature and the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic material under an externally applied magnetic field can be described by the Curie-Weiss Law. The Curie-Weiss Law states that the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of a ferromagnetic material is inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature (T) and the Curie temperature (Tc) of the material. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere:\n- χ is the magnetic susceptibility,\n- C is the Curie constant, which depends on the material,\n- T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin),\n- Tc is the Curie temperature of the material (in Kelvin).\n\nThe Curie temperature is a critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic. Below the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility increases as the temperature decreases, and the material becomes more susceptible to an external magnetic field. Above the Curie temperature, the material behaves as a paramagnet, and its magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie's Law:\n\nχ = C' / T\n\nwhere C' is the paramagnetic Curie constant.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic material under an externally applied magnetic field is described by the Curie-Weiss Law, with the material's susceptibility being inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature and the Curie temperature."
