    "message_2": "The efficiency of a solar cell made of a specific photovoltaic material under different lighting conditions can vary due to several factors. To determine the efficiency, we need to know the material's properties, such as its bandgap, absorption coefficient, and carrier mobility. However, I can provide a general explanation of why the efficiency changes under different lighting conditions.\n\n1. Light intensity: The efficiency of a solar cell is directly related to the amount of light it receives. Under low light conditions, the number of photons absorbed by the solar cell decreases, resulting in fewer electron-hole pairs being generated. This leads to a lower current output and reduced efficiency. Conversely, under high light intensity, the solar cell can absorb more photons and generate more electron-hole pairs, increasing its efficiency.\n\n2. Spectrum of light: The efficiency of a solar cell also depends on the spectrum of light it receives. Photovoltaic materials have a specific bandgap, which determines the range of wavelengths they can absorb. If the incident light has a spectrum that matches the material's absorption range, the solar cell will be more efficient. However, if the light spectrum is outside the material's absorption range, the solar cell will not be able to convert those photons into electricity, reducing its efficiency.\n\n3. Angle of incidence: The angle at which light strikes the solar cell can also affect its efficiency. When light is incident at an angle, the path length of light through the material increases, which can lead to more absorption and higher efficiency. However, if the angle is too steep, the light may be reflected off the surface, reducing the amount of light absorbed and decreasing the efficiency.\n\n4. Temperature: The temperature of the solar cell can also impact its efficiency. As the temperature increases, the semiconductor material's energy bandgap decreases, which can lead to increased recombination of electron-hole pairs and reduced efficiency. Additionally, higher temperatures can cause increased resistive losses in the solar cell, further reducing its efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the efficiency of a solar cell made of a specific photovoltaic material can change under different lighting conditions due to factors such as light intensity, spectrum, angle of incidence, and temperature. To determine the efficiency of a particular solar cell under specific conditions, one would need to know the material's properties and perform detailed calculations or measurements."
