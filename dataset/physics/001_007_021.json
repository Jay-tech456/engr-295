    "message_2": "To find the energy of the fourth excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the energy formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is the quantum number (n = 0 for the ground state, n = 1 for the first excited state, etc.), h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFor the fourth excited state, n = 4. Given the frequency f = 2.5 × 10¹³ Hz and the Planck's constant h = 6.626 × 10^-34 Js, we can calculate the energy:\n\nE_4 = (4 + 1/2) * (6.626 × 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 × 10¹³ Hz)\nE_4 = (4.5) * (6.626 × 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 × 10¹³ Hz)\nE_4 = 4.5 * (1.6565 × 10^-20 J)\nE_4 ≈ 7.45425 × 10^-20 J\n\nSo, the energy of the fourth excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 7.45 × 10^-20 Joules."
