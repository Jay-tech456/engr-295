    "message_2": "As matter and radiation approach the event horizon of a black hole, their behavior and physical properties are significantly affected due to the extreme gravitational forces at play. From an external observer's perspective, several phenomena can be observed:\n\n1. Gravitational redshift: As light or other electromagnetic radiation moves away from the black hole, it loses energy due to the gravitational pull. This causes the wavelength of the radiation to increase, shifting it towards the red end of the spectrum. This is known as gravitational redshift, and it becomes more pronounced as the radiation gets closer to the event horizon.\n\n2. Time dilation: According to the general theory of relativity, time flows more slowly in stronger gravitational fields. As matter and radiation approach the event horizon, the time experienced by them slows down relative to an external observer. This effect is known as gravitational time dilation. From the observer's perspective, it appears as if the matter and radiation are slowing down in time as they approach the event horizon, eventually appearing to freeze at the event horizon.\n\n3. Spaghettification: As matter approaches the event horizon, the difference in gravitational forces acting on different parts of the object becomes more pronounced. This leads to a stretching effect, where the object is elongated along the radial direction towards the black hole and compressed along the other two axes. This process is known as spaghettification or the \"noodle effect.\" For an external observer, the object will appear to be stretched and distorted as it approaches the event horizon.\n\n4. Accretion disk formation: Due to the conservation of angular momentum, matter falling into a black hole often forms an accretion disk around it. The matter in the accretion disk is heated up due to friction and other processes, causing it to emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, X-rays, and gamma rays. This makes the accretion disk observable to external observers, even though the black hole itself remains invisible.\n\n5. Event horizon and the information paradox: Once matter or radiation crosses the event horizon, it becomes causally disconnected from the external universe, meaning that no information about it can be obtained by an external observer. This leads to the black hole information paradox, which questions the compatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, as the latter requires that information is conserved in any physical process.\n\nIn summary, as matter and radiation approach the event horizon of a black hole, they experience gravitational redshift, time dilation, spaghettification, and eventually become part of the accretion disk or cross the event horizon. These phenomena significantly affect their physical properties and observable behavior from an external observer's perspective."
