    "message_2": "The size and mass of a black hole are not directly related to the duration and strength of cosmic inflation. These are two separate phenomena in the field of cosmology and astrophysics.\n\nCosmic inflation is a theory that describes the rapid expansion of the universe during its first few moments after the Big Bang. This expansion is thought to have been driven by a strong repulsive force, which is associated with a scalar field called the inflaton field. The duration and strength of cosmic inflation are determined by the properties of the inflaton field and its potential energy, as well as the initial conditions of the universe.\n\nOn the other hand, black holes are massive objects formed by the gravitational collapse of massive stars or other compact objects. The size and mass of a black hole are determined by the amount of matter that has collapsed into it. The relationship between the mass (M) of a black hole and its size, or more specifically, its event horizon radius (r), is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nWhile both cosmic inflation and black holes are important aspects of our understanding of the universe, their properties and behaviors are governed by different physical processes and are not directly related."
