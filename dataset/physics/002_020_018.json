    "message_2": "To calculate the compressibility factor (Z) of the gas using the Z chart, we first need to determine the reduced pressure (P_r) and reduced temperature (T_r) of the gas. The reduced pressure and temperature are dimensionless quantities that are used to characterize the behavior of real gases.\n\nTo find the reduced pressure and temperature, we need the critical pressure (P_c) and critical temperature (T_c) of the gas. However, the critical properties of the gas are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of P_r and T_r, and thus cannot find the compressibility factor (Z) using the Z chart.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze whether the gas is behaving ideally or non-ideally based on the given information. The ideal gas behavior is described by the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. For an ideal gas, the compressibility factor (Z) is equal to 1.\n\nReal gases deviate from ideal gas behavior at high pressures and low temperatures. In this problem, the pressure is 2 MPa, which is relatively high, and the temperature is 300 K, which is not extremely low but not very high either. Based on these conditions, we can infer that the gas is likely behaving non-ideally, and its compressibility factor (Z) would not be equal to 1.\n\nTo get a more accurate answer, we would need the critical properties of the gas to determine the reduced pressure and temperature, and then use the Z chart to find the compressibility factor."
