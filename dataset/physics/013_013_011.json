    "message_2": "The period of rotation of an object is the time it takes to complete one full rotation. Given the frequency of rotation (rotations per second), we can find the period of rotation using the following formula:\n\nPeriod (T) = 1 / Frequency (f)\n\nIn this case, the neutron star is rotating at a frequency of 500 rotations per second. Therefore, we can calculate the period of rotation as follows:\n\nT = 1 / 500 = 0.002 seconds\n\nSo, the period of rotation of the neutron star is 0.002 seconds."
