    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 5 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength due to a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (5 A), and r is the distance from the wire (2 cm = 0.02 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 0.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from the straight wire carrying a current of 5 A is 0.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
