    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m above the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields to find the total magnetic field at the point.\n\nLet's consider the four segments as follows:\n1. Segment 1: From (-0.25, -0.5) to (-0.25, 0.5)\n2. Segment 2: From (-0.25, 0.5) to (0.25, 0.5)\n3. Segment 3: From (0.25, 0.5) to (0.25, -0.5)\n4. Segment 4: From (0.25, -0.5) to (-0.25, -0.5)\n\nThe point where we want to find the magnetic field is (0, 0, 0.2).\n\nFor each segment, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law expression along the length of the segment. Since the magnetic field is a vector, we need to find the x, y, and z components of the magnetic field for each segment and then sum them up.\n\nAfter performing the integration for each segment and summing up the magnetic field components, we get:\n\nBx = 0 (due to symmetry)\nBy = 0 (due to symmetry)\nBz = (μ₀ * I * a * b) / (2 * π * h * (a² + 4 * h²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere a = 0.5 m, b = 1 m, and h = 0.2 m.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate Bz:\n\nBz = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A * 0.5 m * 1 m) / (2 * π * 0.2 m * (0.5² + 4 * 0.2²)^(3/2))\nBz ≈ 1.07 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point 0.2 m above the center of the loop is approximately 1.07 × 10⁻⁶ T in the z-direction."
