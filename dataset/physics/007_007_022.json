    "message_2": "To determine the chemical shift of the carbon-13 atom in the ethanol molecule, we need to know the Larmor frequency of the carbon-13 nucleus and the reference frequency for carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy.\n\nThe Larmor frequency (ν) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nν = γ * B\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the carbon-13 nucleus, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio for carbon-13 is 67.262 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1. Given the magnetic field strength of 11.7 Tesla, we can calculate the Larmor frequency:\n\nν = (67.262 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1) * (11.7 T)\nν ≈ 786.965 * 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, we need to determine the chemical shift (δ) using the reference frequency for carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy. The reference compound for carbon-13 NMR is tetramethylsilane (TMS), which has a chemical shift of 0 ppm.\n\nThe chemical shift can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nδ = (ν_sample - ν_reference) / ν_reference * 10^6\n\nFor ethanol, the carbon-13 chemical shift values are approximately 58.5 ppm for the CH3 group and 18.5 ppm for the CH2 group. We will calculate the chemical shift for the CH3 group as an example:\n\nν_reference = ν / (1 + (58.5 ppm / 10^6))\nν_reference ≈ 786.965 * 10^6 Hz / (1 + (58.5 / 10^6))\nν_reference ≈ 786.965 * 10^6 Hz / 1.0000585\nν_reference ≈ 786.878 * 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the chemical shift for the CH3 group in ethanol:\n\nδ = ((786.965 * 10^6 Hz) - (786.878 * 10^6 Hz)) / (786.878 * 10^6 Hz) * 10^6\nδ ≈ 58.5 ppm\n\nThus, the chemical shift of the carbon-13 atom in the ethanol molecule for the CH3 group is approximately 58.5 ppm. A similar calculation can be done for the CH2 group using its chemical shift value of 18.5 ppm."
