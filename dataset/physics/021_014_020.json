    "message_2": "The presence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of a galaxy plays a crucial role in the formation and properties of a quasar. A quasar, or quasi-stellar object (QSO), is an extremely bright and distant active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by the accretion of matter onto a SMBH.\n\nHere's how the presence of a SMBH contributes to the formation and properties of a quasar:\n\n1. Accretion disk formation: As the SMBH attracts nearby matter, such as gas and dust, an accretion disk forms around it. The gravitational force of the SMBH causes the material in the accretion disk to spiral inward, converting gravitational potential energy into heat and radiation.\n\n2. High luminosity: The intense gravitational force of the SMBH causes the material in the accretion disk to heat up to very high temperatures, emitting vast amounts of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. This makes quasars some of the most luminous objects in the universe, often outshining their host galaxies.\n\n3. Relativistic jets: In some cases, a portion of the infalling material is ejected in the form of highly collimated, relativistic jets perpendicular to the accretion disk. These jets can extend for thousands of light-years and emit strong radio waves, making quasars easily detectable at radio wavelengths.\n\n4. Influence on host galaxy: The energy and radiation emitted by the quasar can have a significant impact on the host galaxy. This can trigger star formation, as well as heat and expel gas from the galaxy, effectively regulating its growth.\n\n5. Redshift and cosmological distance indicators: Due to the expansion of the universe, quasars exhibit high redshifts, which can be used to estimate their distances and study the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy is essential for the formation and properties of a quasar. The SMBH drives the accretion process, resulting in high luminosity, the production of relativistic jets, and various effects on the host galaxy. Additionally, quasars serve as valuable tools for studying the universe's structure and evolution."
