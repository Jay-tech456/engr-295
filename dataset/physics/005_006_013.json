    "message_2": "To calculate the redshift experienced by a photon near a massive object, we can use the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔΦ/c^2\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔΦ is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nIn this case, we are given the gravitational potential difference (ΔΦ) as 1000 meters. We want to find the amount of redshift (Δλ/λ) experienced by the photon.\n\nΔλ/λ = (1000 m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔλ/λ = 1000 / (9 x 10^16)\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 1.11 x 10^-14\n\nThe amount of redshift experienced by the photon near the massive object with a gravitational potential difference of 1000 meters is approximately 1.11 x 10^-14."
