    "message_2": "To calculate the expected change in the deflection angle of light passing through a galaxy cluster due to the presence of dark matter, we can use the concept of gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is the bending of light due to the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters.\n\nLet's assume a particular distribution of dark matter within the cluster, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, which is a common model for dark matter halos. The NFW profile is given by:\n\nρ(r) = ρ_s / [(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)^2]\n\nwhere ρ(r) is the dark matter density at a distance r from the center of the cluster, ρ_s is a characteristic density, and r_s is a scale radius.\n\nNow, let's consider a particular gravitational model for the cluster, such as the general relativity. In this case, the deflection angle α can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nα = (4 * G * M_enclosed) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_enclosed is the mass enclosed within the impact parameter b (the closest distance between the light path and the center of the cluster), and c is the speed of light.\n\nTo find the mass enclosed within the impact parameter b, we need to integrate the dark matter density profile over the volume:\n\nM_enclosed = ∫ ρ(r) * dV\n\nFor a given distribution of dark matter and a particular gravitational model, we can calculate the deflection angle α. The change in the deflection angle due to the presence of dark matter can be found by comparing the deflection angle with and without dark matter.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified explanation, and the actual calculation would involve more complex mathematical techniques and numerical simulations. The expected change in the deflection angle would depend on the specific distribution of dark matter within the galaxy cluster and the chosen gravitational model."
