    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, is the distance from the center of the black hole at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. The formula for the Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass 10 times greater than the Sun, we can calculate its Schwarzschild radius. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.989 x 10^31)) / (9 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (2.653 x 10^20) / (9 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.948 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of a black hole with a mass 10 times greater than the Sun is approximately 2,948 meters or 2.948 kilometers."
