    "message_2": "The characteristics of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes depend on the masses of the black holes, their distance from each other, and their relative velocities. In this case, we will compare the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 5 solar masses and 10 solar masses (Scenario A) to those produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 50 solar masses and 70 solar masses (Scenario B).\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the merging black holes and inversely proportional to the distance from the observer. In Scenario B, the total mass of the merging black holes is significantly larger than in Scenario A, so the amplitude of the gravitational waves will be much higher in Scenario B.\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of the gravitational waves is determined by the orbital frequency of the merging black holes. As the black holes get closer, they orbit each other faster, and the frequency of the gravitational waves increases. In Scenario A, the smaller black holes will merge more quickly, leading to a higher frequency of gravitational waves compared to Scenario B.\n\n3. Duration: The duration of the gravitational wave signal depends on the time it takes for the black holes to merge. In Scenario A, the smaller black holes will merge more quickly, resulting in a shorter duration of the gravitational wave signal compared to Scenario B.\n\n4. Energy: The energy carried away by the gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the merging black holes. In Scenario B, the total mass of the merging black holes is significantly larger than in Scenario A, so the energy carried away by the gravitational waves will be much higher in Scenario B.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 5 solar masses and 10 solar masses (Scenario A) will have a lower amplitude, higher frequency, shorter duration, and lower energy compared to those produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 50 solar masses and 70 solar masses (Scenario B)."
