    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a particle with non-zero rest mass is the Klein-Gordon equation, which is given by:\n\n(∂^2/∂t^2 - ∇^2 + (mc/ħ)^2)ψ = 0\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ψ is the wave function of the particle. The Klein-Gordon equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the relativistic behavior of a scalar field.\n\nFor a massless particle, the wave equation is the massless Klein-Gordon equation, which is given by:\n\n(∂^2/∂t^2 - ∇^2)ψ = 0\n\nNotice that the mass term (mc/ħ)^2 is absent in the massless Klein-Gordon equation.\n\nNow, let's show how the relativistic wave equation reduces to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. The Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\niħ(∂/∂t)ψ = -(ħ^2/2m)∇^2ψ + Vψ\n\nTo derive the Schrödinger equation from the Klein-Gordon equation, we first consider the non-relativistic limit, where the particle's kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy (mc^2). In this limit, we can make the following ansatz for the wave function:\n\nψ = exp(-imc^2t/ħ)φ\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Klein-Gordon equation, we get:\n\n(∂^2/∂t^2 - ∇^2 + (mc/ħ)^2)(exp(-imc^2t/ħ)φ) = 0\n\nExpanding the derivatives and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n(-m^2c^4/ħ^2 + 2imc^2/ħ(∂/∂t) - ∂^2/∂t^2)φ = ∇^2φ\n\nNow, we can neglect the second-order time derivative term, as it is much smaller than the first-order time derivative term in the non-relativistic limit. This gives us:\n\n(2imc^2/ħ(∂/∂t) - m^2c^4/ħ^2)φ = ∇^2φ\n\nDividing both sides by 2mc^2, we get:\n\n(iħ(∂/∂t)φ = -(ħ^2/2m)∇^2φ + (1/2)mc^2φ\n\nNow, we can introduce a potential energy term V by defining:\n\nV = (1/2)mc^2 - U\n\nwhere U is the actual potential energy experienced by the particle. Substituting this into the equation, we obtain the Schrödinger equation:\n\niħ(∂/∂t)φ = -(ħ^2/2m)∇^2φ + Uφ\n\nThus, we have shown that the relativistic wave equation (Klein-Gordon equation) reduces to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit."
