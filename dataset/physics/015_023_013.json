    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a population of intermediate-mass black holes, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the properties of the black holes: To do this, we need to know the masses (M1 and M2) and the distance (R) between the black holes. Intermediate-mass black holes typically have masses between 100 and 10^5 solar masses.\n\n2. Calculate the chirp mass (Mc): The chirp mass is a combination of the two black hole masses and is given by the formula:\n\n   Mc = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\n3. Calculate the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves: The frequency of the gravitational waves depends on the chirp mass and the time (t) remaining before the black holes merge. The formula for frequency is:\n\n   f = (5/8π)^(3/8) * (Mc^(5/3)) / t^(3/8)\n\n4. Calculate the amplitude (A) of the gravitational waves: The amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the chirp mass, the distance between the black holes, and the frequency of the waves. The formula for amplitude is:\n\n   A = (4/π) * (G * Mc / c^2)^(5/4) / R * f^(2/3)\n\n   where G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nTo determine the optimal configuration of a gravitational wave detector to detect these waves, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Sensitivity: The detector should be sensitive enough to detect the weak gravitational waves emitted by the intermediate-mass black holes. The sensitivity of a detector depends on its design, noise levels, and the frequency range it can detect.\n\n2. Frequency range: The detector should be able to detect the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the black holes. As calculated above, the frequency depends on the chirp mass and the time remaining before the black holes merge.\n\n3. Location: The detector should be located in a place with minimal environmental noise, such as seismic activity, to reduce the chances of false detections.\n\n4. Multiple detectors: To accurately determine the source of the gravitational waves and improve detection confidence, multiple detectors should be used in a network. This allows for triangulation of the source and helps eliminate false detections.\n\n5. Data analysis: Advanced data analysis techniques should be employed to filter out noise and identify the gravitational wave signals.\n\nIn summary, to detect gravitational waves emitted by a population of intermediate-mass black holes, we need to calculate the amplitude and frequency of the waves using the properties of the black holes. Then, we need to design a gravitational wave detector with the appropriate sensitivity, frequency range, location, and data analysis techniques to detect these waves. Multiple detectors in a network can further improve detection accuracy and confidence."
