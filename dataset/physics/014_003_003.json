    "message_2": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has a black body spectrum. The temperature of the CMB radiation is related to the scale factor of the universe, which is a measure of the size of the universe at a given time.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB radiation at any time t is given by:\n\nT(t) = T₀ * (a₀ / a(t))\n\nwhere T₀ is the temperature of the CMB radiation today, a₀ is the scale factor of the universe today, and a(t) is the scale factor of the universe at time t.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB radiation today, T₀, is approximately 2.73 K. The scale factor of the universe today, a₀, is 1 by definition.\n\nTo find the scale factor of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time. This means that the universe was dominated by radiation, and the scale factor is related to time by the following equation:\n\na(t) ∝ t^(1/2)\n\nTo find the proportionality constant, we can use the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time, which means that the temperature was around 3000 K (the temperature at which hydrogen becomes ionized). So, at t = 380,000 years:\n\n3000 K = T₀ * (a₀ / a(380,000 years))\n\nWe can solve for the scale factor at 380,000 years:\n\na(380,000 years) = a₀ * (T₀ / 3000 K)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for T₀ and a₀:\n\na(380,000 years) = 1 * (2.73 K / 3000 K)\na(380,000 years) ≈ 0.00091\n\nNow that we have the scale factor at 380,000 years, we can calculate the temperature of the universe at that time using the equation for T(t):\n\nT(380,000 years) = T₀ * (a₀ / a(380,000 years))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT(380,000 years) = 2.73 K * (1 / 0.00091)\nT(380,000 years) ≈ 3000 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang was approximately 3000 K."
