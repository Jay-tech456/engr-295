    "message_2": "The event horizon and the singularity are two distinct features of a black hole, each with its own implications on the black hole's gravitational pull.\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It is often referred to as the \"point of no return.\" The size of the event horizon is determined by the black hole's mass and is directly proportional to it. The larger the mass, the larger the event horizon. The gravitational pull at the event horizon is extremely strong, but it is not infinite.\n\nThe singularity, on the other hand, is the point at the very center of the black hole where all its mass is concentrated. It is an infinitely small and dense point, where the laws of physics as we know them break down. At the singularity, the gravitational pull is theoretically infinite, and spacetime curvature becomes infinite as well.\n\nThe difference between the event horizon and the singularity affects the gravitational pull of the black hole in the following ways:\n\n1. Outside the event horizon: The gravitational pull of a black hole outside its event horizon is similar to that of any other massive object, like a star. It follows the inverse-square law, which means that the gravitational force decreases as the square of the distance from the black hole increases. If you are far enough away from the black hole, its gravitational pull on you would be negligible.\n\n2. At the event horizon: The gravitational pull at the event horizon is extremely strong, but not infinite. It is strong enough to prevent anything, including light, from escaping once it crosses this boundary. This is why black holes appear black - no light can escape from within the event horizon.\n\n3. Inside the event horizon: Once an object crosses the event horizon, it is inevitably drawn towards the singularity at the center of the black hole. The gravitational pull inside the event horizon increases as the object gets closer to the singularity. At the singularity itself, the gravitational pull is theoretically infinite.\n\nIn summary, the event horizon and the singularity are two different aspects of a black hole that affect its gravitational pull in distinct ways. The event horizon marks the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravity, while the singularity is the point at the center where the gravitational pull becomes infinite and the known laws of physics break down."
