    "message_2": "The average annual dose of cosmic radiation received by an individual living at sea level is approximately 0.3 millisieverts (mSv). This value can vary depending on factors such as geographical location and altitude.\n\nThe potential health effects of exposure to cosmic ray background radiation on human DNA are generally considered to be minimal. The human body has evolved to repair most of the damage caused by low levels of radiation, and the dose received from cosmic rays is relatively small compared to other sources of natural background radiation, such as radon gas.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the risk of health effects increases with the dose of radiation received. At higher doses, ionizing radiation can cause damage to DNA, which may lead to mutations and an increased risk of cancer. This is why astronauts, who are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation in space, are carefully monitored for radiation exposure and potential health effects.\n\nIn summary, the average annual dose of cosmic radiation received by an individual living at sea level is relatively low, and the potential health effects on human DNA are minimal. However, it is essential to continue studying the long-term effects of low-dose radiation exposure to better understand any potential risks."
