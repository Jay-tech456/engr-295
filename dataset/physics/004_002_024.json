    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It is the point of no return for any object that crosses it.\n\nTo calculate the event horizon radius (also known as the Schwarzschild radius) of a black hole, we can use the formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass into kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 3 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.967 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s â‰ˆ 8.846 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,846 meters or 8.846 kilometers."
