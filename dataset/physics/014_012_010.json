    "message_2": "To estimate the magnetic field in a galaxy, we can use the equipartition formula, which relates the magnetic field strength (B) to the energy density of cosmic rays and the energy density of the magnetic field. The equipartition formula is given by:\n\nB = (6π * (ρ_c / ρ_B))^(1/2)\n\nwhere ρ_c is the cosmic ray energy density and ρ_B is the magnetic field energy density. However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate these values. Instead, we can use an empirical relation between the magnetic field strength and the rotational velocity of the galaxy, which is given by:\n\nB ~ V_rot^(2/3)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength and V_rot is the rotational velocity of the galaxy. This relation is derived from the assumption that the magnetic field is in equipartition with the kinetic energy of the galaxy's rotation.\n\nGiven the rotational velocity of the galaxy (V_rot) is 200 km/s, we can estimate the magnetic field strength (B) as:\n\nB ~ (200 km/s)^(2/3)\n\nConverting the velocity to m/s:\n\n200 km/s * (1000 m/km) = 200,000 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB ~ (200,000 m/s)^(2/3) ≈ 6.3 μT (microtesla)\n\nThis is an estimation of the magnetic field strength in the rotating galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster.\n\nNow, let's consider a similar non-rotating galaxy. Since the magnetic field strength is related to the rotational velocity, a non-rotating galaxy (with a rotational velocity of 0) would have a much weaker magnetic field. In fact, the magnetic field strength would be close to zero. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified model, and in reality, there could still be some magnetic field present in a non-rotating galaxy due to other factors such as turbulence and local magnetic fields generated by stars and other celestial objects.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is estimated to be around 6.3 μT, while a similar non-rotating galaxy would have a much weaker magnetic field, close to zero."
