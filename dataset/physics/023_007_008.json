    "message_2": "To perform a complete quantum state tomography on a 3-qubit system, we need to make a series of projective measurements in different bases to reconstruct the density matrix representation of the state. The density matrix ρ can be written as a linear combination of tensor products of Pauli matrices:\n\nρ = ∑(c_ijk * σ_i ⊗ σ_j ⊗ σ_k)\n\nwhere σ_i, σ_j, and σ_k are the Pauli matrices (I, X, Y, Z) for each qubit, and c_ijk are the coefficients to be determined. There are a total of 4^3 = 64 coefficients, but since the density matrix is Hermitian and has trace 1, we only need to measure 63 independent coefficients.\n\nTo measure these coefficients, we perform projective measurements in the following bases for each qubit: {|0>, |1>}, {|+>, |->}, {|+i>, |-i>}, and {|0> ± |1>}. Here, |+> = (|0> + |1>)/√2, |-> = (|0> - |1>)/√2, |+i> = (|0> + i|1>)/√2, and |-i> = (|0> - i|1>)/√2.\n\nFor each combination of bases, we perform a projective measurement on the 3-qubit system and record the probabilities of obtaining each of the 8 possible outcomes (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). We repeat this process for all 4^3 = 64 combinations of bases.\n\nOnce we have the probabilities for each combination of bases, we can use them to calculate the coefficients c_ijk. For example, to calculate c_000 (which is always 1/8 since the trace of the density matrix is 1), we can use the probabilities obtained when measuring in the {|0>, |1>} basis for all qubits:\n\nc_000 = 1/8 * (P(000) + P(001) + P(010) + P(011) + P(100) + P(101) + P(110) + P(111))\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the other coefficients using the probabilities obtained in the other bases.\n\nFinally, we can write down the density matrix representation of the state using the calculated coefficients:\n\nρ = ∑(c_ijk * σ_i ⊗ σ_j ⊗ σ_k)\n\nThis density matrix fully characterizes the quantum state of the 3-qubit system."
