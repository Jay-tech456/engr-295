    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the half-life of a radioactive material using a Geiger-Muller counter. The student has a sample of the radioactive material and measures the count rate to be 200 counts per minute at the start of the experiment. After 30 minutes, the count rate drops to 50 counts per minute. What is the half-life of the radioactive material?",
    "message_2": "To determine the half-life of the radioactive material, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the count rate at time t, N0 is the initial count rate, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life of the material.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN0 = 200 counts per minute\nN(t) = 50 counts per minute\nt = 30 minutes\n\nWe want to find the half-life T. We can rearrange the formula to solve for T:\n\nT = (t * log(1/2)) / log(N(t)/N0)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT = (30 * log(1/2)) / log(50/200)\n\nT ≈ (30 * (-0.3010)) / (-1.2041)\n\nT ≈ 7.5 minutes\n\nThe half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 7.5 minutes."
