The overall efficiency of the power plant includes the efficiency of both the reactor and the generator. Express your answer as a percentage.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the nuclear power plant, we need to divide the electrical power output by the thermal power input and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nEfficiency = (Electrical Power Output / Thermal Power Input) × 100\n\nEfficiency = (1200 MW / 1600 MW) × 100\n\nEfficiency = 0.75 × 100\n\nEfficiency = 75%\n\nThe efficiency of the nuclear power plant is 75%."
