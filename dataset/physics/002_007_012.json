    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the heat capacity of a copper block. The copper block has a mass of 150g and is initially at a temperature of 25°C. The student adds heat to the block until it reaches a final temperature of 75°C. During the heating process, the student measures the amount of heat added to the block, which is 200 J. Based on this information, what is the heat capacity of the copper block?",
    "message_2": "To determine the heat capacity of the copper block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat added (200 J), m is the mass of the block (150 g), c is the specific heat capacity of copper, and ΔT is the change in temperature (75°C - 25°C).\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C = 50°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nc = 200 J / (150 g × 50°C)\n\nc = 200 J / 7500 g°C\n\nc ≈ 0.0267 J/g°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the copper block is approximately 0.0267 J/g°C."
