    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nR = 0.1 m\nI = 2 A\nx = 0.05 m\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * 0.0125 m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point on the axis of the loop is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
