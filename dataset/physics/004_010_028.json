    "message_2": "The radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole can be determined using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (radius of the event horizon), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 4 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms using the mass of the Sun (M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg):\n\nM = 4 * M_sun = 4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 7.956 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug in the values for G and c:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nR_s = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (7.956 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s â‰ˆ 2.354 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon of the non-rotating black hole with a mass of 4 solar masses is approximately 23.54 kilometers."
