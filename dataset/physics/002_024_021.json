    "message_1": "What is the vaporization temperature of a substance, given a known heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure at two different temperatures, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures to its heat of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\n- P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization of the substance\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n\nWe are given the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) and the vapor pressure at two different temperatures (P1 and T1, P2 and T2). We want to find the vaporization temperature (Tvap), which is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure (Patm). \n\nTo find Tvap, we can set P2 to Patm and T2 to Tvap in the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(Patm/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/Tvap - 1/T1)\n\nNow, we can solve for Tvap:\n\n1/Tvap - 1/T1 = ln(Patm/P1) * (-R/ΔHvap)\n\n1/Tvap = 1/T1 + ln(Patm/P1) * (-R/ΔHvap)\n\nTvap = 1 / (1/T1 + ln(Patm/P1) * (-R/ΔHvap))\n\nNow, plug in the given values for ΔHvap, P1, T1, P2, and T2, and solve for Tvap. Make sure to use the appropriate units for each variable (e.g., temperature in Kelvin, pressure in the same units, and heat of vaporization in J/mol)."
