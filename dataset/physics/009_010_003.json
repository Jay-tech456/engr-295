    "message_2": "To calculate the magnification produced by the lens, we first need to find the image distance using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 40 cm\n\nWe can rearrange the lens formula to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/f - 1/u\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1/v = 1/20 - 1/40\n1/v = (2 - 1)/40\n1/v = 1/40\n\nSo, v = 40 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -40/40\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification produced by the lens is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
