    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: m = -v/u\n\nHere, f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, v is the image distance, and m is the magnification.\n\nGiven, magnification m = -2, object distance u = -20 cm (negative sign because the object is placed in front of the mirror), and focal length f = -10 cm (negative sign because it is a concave mirror).\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the magnification formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n-2 = -v/(-20)\nv = 40 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the object distance:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-10) = 1/(-20) + 1/40\n\nMultiplying both sides by -40 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-4 = -2 + 1\n-4 + 2 = 1\n-2 = 1\n\nThis result is not possible, which indicates that there is an error in the given information. The object distance and focal length provided cannot produce a magnification of -2 for a concave mirror. Please check the given information and try again."
