    "message_1": "A spaceship moves through space at a significant fraction of the speed of light. What is the kinetic energy of the spaceship according to the theory of Special Relativity? Given that the mass of the spaceship is 9000 kg and its velocity is 0.6c.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of the spaceship according to the theory of Special Relativity, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.6c).\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / √(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.25 - 1)(9000 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.25(9000 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 2.25 x 10^20 Joules\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the spaceship according to the theory of Special Relativity is approximately 2.25 x 10^20 Joules."
