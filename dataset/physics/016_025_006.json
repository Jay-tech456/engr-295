    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field strength (Hc) required to maintain superconductivity in NbTi wires can be determined using the empirical formula:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field strength at absolute zero temperature (0 K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Tc is the critical temperature at which the material loses its superconductivity.\n\nFor NbTi wires, the critical temperature Tc is approximately 9.2 K, and the critical magnetic field strength at 0 K, Hc(0), is about 14.5 T (Tesla).\n\nTo find the critical magnetic field strength at a specific temperature, we can plug the values into the formula. For example, let's find the critical magnetic field strength at 4.2 K:\n\nHc(4.2 K) = 14.5 T * (1 - (4.2/9.2)^2)\nHc(4.2 K) = 14.5 T * (1 - 0.2087^2)\nHc(4.2 K) = 14.5 T * (1 - 0.0435)\nHc(4.2 K) = 14.5 T * 0.9565\nHc(4.2 K) â‰ˆ 13.87 T\n\nSo, the critical magnetic field strength required to maintain superconductivity in NbTi wires at 4.2 K is approximately 13.87 T.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the critical magnetic field strength decreases, as shown by the formula. This means that as the temperature approaches the critical temperature (9.2 K), the material becomes more susceptible to losing its superconductivity due to the presence of a magnetic field."
