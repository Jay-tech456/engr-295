    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the values, we have:\n\nI = 2 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 4π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 12.57 × 10⁻⁶ T, or 12.57 µT."
