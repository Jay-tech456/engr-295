    "message_2": "To determine the molar volume of the gas mixture, we can use the ideal gas law, which is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the temperature (T = 300 K) and the pressure (P = 1 atm). We need to find the molar volume, which is the volume per mole of the gas mixture (V/n).\n\nFirst, let's convert the pressure to the SI unit, which is pascals (Pa). 1 atm is equal to 101325 Pa.\n\nP = 1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nThe ideal gas constant R has a value of 8.314 J/(mol·K) when using SI units.\n\nNow, let's find the molar volume (V/n) of the mixture. Rearranging the ideal gas law equation, we get:\n\nV/n = RT/P\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have:\n\nV/n = (8.314 J/(mol·K) × 300 K) / 101325 Pa\n\nV/n ≈ 0.0247 m³/mol\n\nThe molar volume of the gas mixture is approximately 0.0247 m³/mol."
