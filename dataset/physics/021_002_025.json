    "message_2": "According to the theory of general relativity, the relationship between the mass (M) of a black hole and the size (radius) of its event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), can be described by the Schwarzschild equation:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nThis equation shows that the size of a black hole's event horizon is directly proportional to its mass. As the mass of a black hole increases, so does the size of its event horizon."
