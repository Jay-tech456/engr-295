    "message_1": "A wooden block is floating in water with 30% of its volume submerged. If the block has a density of 600 kg/m³, what is the volume of the block and what is the weight of the block in air? (Hint: use Archimedes' principle)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the block.\n\nLet V be the volume of the block, and ρ_block be the density of the block (600 kg/m³). The mass of the block (m_block) can be calculated as:\n\nm_block = ρ_block * V\n\nThe weight of the block in air (W_block) can be calculated as:\n\nW_block = m_block * g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.81 m/s²)\n\nSince 30% of the block's volume is submerged, the volume of water displaced (V_water) is:\n\nV_water = 0.3 * V\n\nThe density of water (ρ_water) is approximately 1000 kg/m³. The mass of the displaced water (m_water) can be calculated as:\n\nm_water = ρ_water * V_water\n\nThe weight of the displaced water (W_water) can be calculated as:\n\nW_water = m_water * g\n\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force (W_water) is equal to the weight of the block in air (W_block):\n\nW_block = W_water\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for the volume of the block (V):\n\nρ_block * V * g = ρ_water * 0.3 * V * g\n\nDivide both sides by g:\n\nρ_block * V = ρ_water * 0.3 * V\n\nNow, divide both sides by V:\n\nρ_block = ρ_water * 0.3\n\nNow, we can solve for the volume of the block (V):\n\nV = (ρ_block / (ρ_water * 0.3))\n\nV = (600 kg/m³) / (1000 kg/m³ * 0.3)\n\nV = 600 / 300\n\nV = 2 m³\n\nNow that we have the volume of the block, we can calculate its weight in air (W_block):\n\nW_block = ρ_block * V * g\n\nW_block = 600 kg/m³ * 2 m³ * 9.81 m/s²\n\nW_block = 1200 kg * 9.81 m/s²\n\nW_block = 11772 N\n\nSo, the volume of the block is 2 m³, and its weight in air is 11772 N."
