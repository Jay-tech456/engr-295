Additionally, what are some of the implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe that stem from this discrepancy between dark matter and ordinary matter?",
    "message_2": "The current accepted range for the abundance of dark matter in the universe, according to recent astronomical observations, is approximately 26.1% of the total energy content of the universe. In comparison, ordinary (baryonic) matter makes up about 4.9% of the total energy content. This means that dark matter is roughly 5.3 times more abundant than ordinary matter.\n\nThis discrepancy between dark matter and ordinary matter has significant implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. Some of these implications include:\n\n1. Galaxy formation and evolution: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies. The gravitational influence of dark matter is believed to have helped pull ordinary matter together to form galaxies. Without dark matter, the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe would be difficult to explain.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Observations of gravitational lensing, where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The amount of lensing observed cannot be accounted for by the mass of ordinary matter alone, suggesting the presence of a more massive, unseen component – dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the formation of structures in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales is influenced by the presence of dark matter. The observed large-scale structure of the universe is consistent with the predictions of dark matter models, providing further evidence for its existence.\n\n5. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxies. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, unseen component – dark matter – that provides additional gravitational influence.\n\nIn summary, the discrepancy between the abundance of dark matter and ordinary matter has profound implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the behavior of light and matter on cosmic scales."
