    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane, we first need to determine the enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH₄(g) + 2 O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g)\n\nUsing the given standard enthalpies of formation (∆H°f), we can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n∆H = [∆H°f (CO2) + 2 * ∆H°f (H2O)] - [∆H°f (CH4) + 2 * ∆H°f (O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (O₂ in this case) is zero, the equation becomes:\n\n∆H = [(-393.5) + 2 * (-285.8)] - [(-74.8) + 2 * (0)]\n\n∆H = (-393.5 - 571.6) + 74.8\n∆H = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the entropy change (∆S) for the reaction. Unfortunately, we don't have the entropy values provided. However, we can still express the Gibbs free energy change in terms of enthalpy and entropy changes:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nWhere ∆G is the Gibbs free energy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the entropy change. Without the entropy values, we cannot calculate the exact Gibbs free energy change. However, we can say that the combustion of methane is an exothermic process since the enthalpy change is negative (∆H = -890.3 kJ/mol)."
