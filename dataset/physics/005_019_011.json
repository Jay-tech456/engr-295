    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving with a velocity of 0.9c towards a planet where there is a transmitting antenna. The antenna transmits a radio signal at a frequency of 2 GHz. Another identical spaceship is stationary on the opposite side of the planet relative to the transmitting antenna. Calculate the frequency of the signal received by the stationary spaceship due to relativistic wave interference.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the signal received by the stationary spaceship due to relativistic wave interference, we need to consider the Doppler effect in special relativity. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler formula is given by:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, and β is the ratio of the relative velocity between the source and the observer to the speed of light (v/c).\n\nIn this case, the source frequency f is 2 GHz, and the relative velocity between the moving spaceship and the stationary spaceship is 0.9c. Therefore, β = 0.9.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the relativistic Doppler formula:\n\nf' = 2 GHz * sqrt((1 + 0.9) / (1 - 0.9))\nf' = 2 GHz * sqrt(1.9 / 0.1)\nf' = 2 GHz * sqrt(19)\nf' ≈ 2 GHz * 4.36\nf' ≈ 8.72 GHz\n\nThe frequency of the signal received by the stationary spaceship due to relativistic wave interference is approximately 8.72 GHz."
