    "message_1": "A circular loop carrying a current of 5 A has a radius of 0.2 m. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop. Also, what would be the magnetic field if the radius of the circular loop is doubled while the current remains the same?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nFor the given problem, I = 5 A and r = 0.2 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / (0.4 m)\n\nB = 50π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.57 × 10⁻⁵ T.\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field when the radius of the circular loop is doubled. If the radius is doubled, the new radius r' = 2 * 0.2 m = 0.4 m. Keeping the current the same, we can use the same formula:\n\nB' = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r')\n\nB' = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.4 m)\n\nB' = (20π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / (0.8 m)\n\nB' = 25π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB' ≈ 7.85 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, when the radius of the circular loop is doubled, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 7.85 × 10⁻⁶ T."
