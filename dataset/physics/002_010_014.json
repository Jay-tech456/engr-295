    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to vaporize the water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = m * L\n\nwhere Q is the heat required, m is the mass of the water, and L is the specific latent heat of vaporization.\n\nGiven the mass of water (m) is 50 grams and the specific latent heat of vaporization (L) is 2260 J/g, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = 50 g * 2260 J/g\n\nQ = 113000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to vaporize 50 grams of water at 100°C is 113,000 Joules."
