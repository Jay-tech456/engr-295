    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment, then multiply the result by 4 since the magnetic field contributions from each segment are symmetrical.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is 10 cm or 0.1 m. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the segment to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop.\n\nLet's choose a coordinate system such that the center of the loop is at the origin, and the segment we are considering lies along the x-axis from x = -0.05 m to x = 0.05 m. The position vector r for a point on the segment is given by:\n\nr = xi + 0j + 0.05k (in meters)\n\nwhere x varies from -0.05 to 0.05, and i, j, and k are unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.\n\nThe current element dl is given by:\n\ndl = dx i (in meters)\n\nwhere dx is a small increment along the x-axis.\n\nNow we can calculate the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (dx i) x (xi + 0.05k) = -0.05 dx k\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + 0.05^2)\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate along the x-axis:\n\nB = 4 * ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (-0.05 dx k)) / (x^2 + 0.05^2)^(3/2) from x = -0.05 to x = 0.05\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a) / π ∫(-dx) / (x^2 + a^2)^(3/2) from x = -a to x = a\n\nwhere a = 0.05 m.\n\nThis integral can be solved using a standard integral table or a computer algebra system, which gives:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a) / π * (1 / a^2)\n\nNow we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and a:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.05 m) / (π * 0.05^2 m²)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.05) / 0.05^2\n\nB = 8π × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 8π × 10^(-7) T or approximately 2.51 × 10^(-6) T."
