    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nGiven the solenoid has 500 turns per meter length (n = 500 turns/m), a current of 2A (I = 2A), and a radius of 5cm (which doesn't affect the calculation of the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (500 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1000 turns/m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 1000\n\nB ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-4) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 6.28 × 10^(-4) T (tesla)."
