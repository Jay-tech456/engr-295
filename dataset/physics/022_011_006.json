    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the observed gravitational lensing effect in the universe. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxies or galaxy clusters. This bending of light allows us to observe the distribution of mass in the universe, both visible and invisible (dark matter).\n\nDark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, and it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its gravitational influence can be observed through gravitational lensing. The presence of dark matter enhances the overall lensing effect, as it contributes to the total mass of the lensing object.\n\nThe study of gravitational lensing has provided valuable insights into the distribution and behavior of dark matter. By analyzing the lensing effect around galaxy clusters, astronomers can create maps of the distribution of dark matter within these clusters. These maps reveal that dark matter is not uniformly distributed but forms a complex cosmic web, with dense regions connected by filaments and surrounded by voids.\n\nFurthermore, gravitational lensing has been used to test different dark matter models and their predictions. For example, the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters can be compared to the predictions of cold dark matter (CDM) and warm dark matter (WDM) models. Observations so far have been consistent with the CDM model, which suggests that dark matter particles are slow-moving and have a low thermal velocity.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the observed gravitational lensing effect in the universe. This impact has allowed us to gain insights into the distribution and behavior of dark matter, which is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing has become a powerful tool for probing the nature of dark matter and testing different theoretical models."
