    "message_2": "To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of the diamond (2.42), and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1). The critical angle occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2.42 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1/2.42\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1/2.42)\n\nθ1 ≈ 24.4 degrees\n\nThe critical angle of a diamond with a refractive index of 2.42 when it is in contact with air is approximately 24.4 degrees."
