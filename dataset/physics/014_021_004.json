    "message_2": "The relationship between the intensity of cosmic rays and the Earth's magnetic field at different latitudes can be described by the concept of geomagnetic cutoff rigidity. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons, originating from outer space that constantly bombard the Earth. The Earth's magnetic field acts as a shield, deflecting and trapping these charged particles.\n\nGeomagnetic cutoff rigidity is a measure of the minimum energy (or momentum) required for a cosmic ray particle to penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and reach a specific location on the Earth's surface. This value depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the latitude of the location.\n\nAt higher latitudes (closer to the poles), the Earth's magnetic field lines are more vertical, and the magnetic field strength is weaker. This allows cosmic rays with lower energies to penetrate the magnetic shield and reach the Earth's surface, resulting in a higher intensity of cosmic rays.\n\nAt lower latitudes (closer to the equator), the Earth's magnetic field lines are more horizontal, and the magnetic field strength is stronger. This means that only cosmic rays with higher energies can penetrate the magnetic shield and reach the Earth's surface, resulting in a lower intensity of cosmic rays.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the intensity of cosmic rays and the Earth's magnetic field at different latitudes can be described as follows: the intensity of cosmic rays is higher at higher latitudes (closer to the poles) due to the weaker magnetic field, and lower at lower latitudes (closer to the equator) due to the stronger magnetic field."
