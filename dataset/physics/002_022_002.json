    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of solute X, we first need to determine the molality of the solution and the theoretical osmotic pressure using the van't Hoff equation. Then, we can compare the theoretical osmotic pressure to the given osmotic pressure to find the activity coefficient.\n\n1. Calculate the molality of the solution:\nMolality (m) = moles of solute / kg of solvent\nSince the solvent is water, we can assume that 1 liter of water weighs 1 kg. Therefore, 2 liters of water weigh 2 kg.\n\nMolality (m) = 5 moles / 2 kg = 2.5 mol/kg\n\n2. Calculate the theoretical osmotic pressure using the van't Hoff equation:\nπ = i * m * R * T\nwhere π is the osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor (which is 1 for non-electrolytes like solute X), m is the molality, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm/mol K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, calculate the theoretical osmotic pressure:\nπ = 1 * 2.5 mol/kg * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * 298.15 K = 61.25 atm\n\n3. Calculate the activity coefficient (γ) of solute X:\nThe activity coefficient can be calculated by comparing the given osmotic pressure (4 atm) to the theoretical osmotic pressure (61.25 atm).\n\nγ = (Given osmotic pressure) / (Theoretical osmotic pressure)\nγ = 4 atm / 61.25 atm = 0.0653\n\nThe activity coefficient of solute X in the solution is approximately 0.0653."
