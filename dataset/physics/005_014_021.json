    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance the particle travels before it decays. We can do this by finding the time it takes for the particle to decay and then multiplying it by the speed of the particle.\n\nFirst, we need to account for time dilation due to the particle's relativistic speed. The time dilation factor is given by the following formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the particle, c is the speed of light, and γ is the time dilation factor.\n\nFor the given problem, v = 0.9c. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.9c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / √(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the time dilation factor, we can find the time it takes for the particle to decay in the reference frame of an observer. The proper time (τ) is the time it takes for the particle to decay in its own reference frame, which is given as the half-life of the particle (600 ns). The dilated time (t) is the time it takes for the particle to decay in the observer's reference frame and can be found using the following formula:\n\nt = γτ\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nt ≈ 2.294 × 600 ns\nt ≈ 1376.4 ns\n\nNow that we have the time it takes for the particle to decay in the observer's reference frame, we can find the distance it travels before it decays. The distance (d) can be found using the following formula:\n\nd = vt\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nd = 0.9c × 1376.4 ns\nd ≈ 0.9 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1376.4 × 10^-9 s)\nd ≈ 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1.3764 × 10^-6\nd ≈ 3.72 × 10^2 m\n\nSo, the particle will travel approximately 372 meters before it decays."
