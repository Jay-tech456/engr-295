    "message_2": "The W and Z bosons are the carriers of the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. Their masses have been measured experimentally and are approximately:\n\n- W boson: 80.4 GeV/c²\n- Z boson: 91.2 GeV/c²\n\nThese values are critical to the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions. The masses of the W and Z bosons are related to the Higgs mechanism, which is responsible for giving particles mass through their interactions with the Higgs field. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and validated the Standard Model's predictions.\n\nThe relatively large masses of the W and Z bosons compared to other particles, such as photons, are responsible for the short range of the weak nuclear force. This force is responsible for processes like beta decay, which plays a crucial role in nuclear reactions, such as those occurring in the sun.\n\nIn summary, the measured masses of the W and Z bosons are essential components of the Standard Model of particle physics, and their values have significant implications for our understanding of the weak nuclear force and the Higgs mechanism."
