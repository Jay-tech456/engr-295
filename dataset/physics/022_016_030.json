    "message_2": "The existence of sterile neutrinos as a major constituent of dark matter is still an open question in the field of particle physics. Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity, making them a potential candidate for dark matter. However, the probability and evidence for their existence are not yet conclusive.\n\nThere have been several experimental hints and indirect evidence pointing towards the existence of sterile neutrinos. For example, some anomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments and the detection of an unidentified X-ray emission line from galaxy clusters have been interpreted as potential signs of sterile neutrinos. However, these results are not yet definitive and could be explained by other phenomena or experimental uncertainties.\n\nIn comparison to other dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions, sterile neutrinos are less favored by current experimental data and theoretical considerations. WIMPs, for instance, have been extensively studied and are well-motivated by supersymmetry, a popular extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. Axions, on the other hand, arise naturally in some theories that address the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nNevertheless, the search for sterile neutrinos and other dark matter candidates is ongoing, and future experiments and observations may provide more conclusive evidence. Currently, it is difficult to assign a precise probability to the existence of sterile neutrinos as a major constituent of dark matter, as this depends on various factors, including the development of new theoretical frameworks and the outcomes of future experimental searches.\n\nIn summary, while there is some indirect evidence and theoretical motivation for sterile neutrinos as a dark matter candidate, they are not as favored as other candidates like WIMPs or axions. The probability of their existence as a major constituent of dark matter is still uncertain and will depend on future experimental results and theoretical developments."
