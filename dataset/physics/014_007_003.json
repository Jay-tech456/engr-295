    "message_2": "The cosmic web is a large-scale structure of the universe, consisting of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and dark matter, interconnected by filaments and separated by vast voids. The size and density distribution of voids and galaxy clusters in the cosmic web can be characterized as follows:\n\n1. Voids: Voids are vast, relatively empty regions of space that can span tens to hundreds of millions of light-years across. They are formed due to the gravitational collapse of dark matter and baryonic matter into filaments and galaxy clusters, leaving behind underdense regions. The density of voids is typically less than 10% of the average density of the universe.\n\nThe size distribution of voids is not uniform, with smaller voids being more common than larger ones. The typical size of voids ranges from 20 to 50 million light-years, although larger voids with sizes up to 300 million light-years have been observed. The density distribution within voids is also not uniform, with some regions being almost completely devoid of galaxies, while others may contain a few isolated galaxies or small groups.\n\n2. Galaxy clusters: Galaxy clusters are massive structures containing hundreds to thousands of galaxies, bound together by gravity. They are the densest regions in the cosmic web and can span several million light-years across. The density of galaxy clusters is much higher than that of voids, with the average density being more than 100 times the average density of the universe.\n\nThe size distribution of galaxy clusters is also not uniform, with smaller clusters being more common than larger ones. The typical size of galaxy clusters ranges from 2 to 10 million light-years, although larger clusters with sizes up to 30 million light-years have been observed. The density distribution within galaxy clusters is also not uniform, with the central regions being denser than the outskirts.\n\nIn summary, voids in the cosmic web are larger and less dense than galaxy clusters. Voids typically have sizes ranging from 20 to 50 million light-years and densities less than 10% of the average density of the universe, while galaxy clusters have sizes ranging from 2 to 10 million light-years and densities more than 100 times the average density of the universe. The size and density distributions of both voids and galaxy clusters are not uniform, with smaller and less dense structures being more common than larger and denser ones."
