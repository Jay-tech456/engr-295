    "message_2": "The relationship between the frequency of sound waves and pitch perception in humans is that the pitch of a sound is directly related to the frequency of the sound wave. In other words, as the frequency of a sound wave increases, the perceived pitch of the sound also increases, and vice versa.\n\nFrequency is the number of complete oscillations or cycles a wave makes per unit of time, typically measured in Hertz (Hz). In the case of sound waves, these oscillations are the compressions and rarefactions of air particles that propagate through the medium (air, in this case).\n\nThe human ear can perceive sounds within a specific frequency range, typically between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below this range are called infrasound, while those above are called ultrasound. Both are inaudible to humans.\n\nThe physics of sound can be used to explain the difference between a high-pitched sound and a low-pitched sound by examining the properties of the sound waves. High-pitched sounds have a higher frequency, meaning that the oscillations of the sound wave are more frequent and closer together. This results in a greater number of compressions and rarefactions reaching the human ear per unit of time, which our brain interprets as a high-pitched sound.\n\nOn the other hand, low-pitched sounds have a lower frequency, meaning that the oscillations of the sound wave are less frequent and farther apart. This results in fewer compressions and rarefactions reaching the human ear per unit of time, which our brain interprets as a low-pitched sound.\n\nIn summary, the pitch perception in humans is directly related to the frequency of sound waves. High-pitched sounds have higher frequencies and more closely spaced oscillations, while low-pitched sounds have lower frequencies and more widely spaced oscillations."
