    "message_1": "A rectangular wire loop of width 12 cm and length 16 cm carries a current of 2 A. Find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, assuming the wire is uniform and the current flows through the wire in the clockwise direction.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular wire loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider each segment of the rectangle:\n\n1. Top segment: The magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing into the plane (using the right-hand rule). The distance from the center to the top segment is half the width, which is 6 cm or 0.06 m. The length of the segment is 16 cm or 0.16 m.\n\n2. Bottom segment: The magnetic field due to this segment will also be pointing into the plane. The distance from the center to the bottom segment is the same as the top segment, 6 cm or 0.06 m. The length of the segment is the same as the top segment, 16 cm or 0.16 m.\n\n3. Left segment: The magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing out of the plane. The distance from the center to the left segment is half the length, which is 8 cm or 0.08 m. The length of the segment is 12 cm or 0.12 m.\n\n4. Right segment: The magnetic field due to this segment will also be pointing out of the plane. The distance from the center to the right segment is the same as the left segment, 8 cm or 0.08 m. The length of the segment is the same as the left segment, 12 cm or 0.12 m.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire at a perpendicular distance R from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πR)\n\nCalculating the magnetic field due to each segment:\n\nB_top = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.06 m) = 6.67 × 10^(-6) T\nB_bottom = B_top (since the current and distance are the same) = 6.67 × 10^(-6) T\nB_left = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.08 m) = 5 × 10^(-6) T\nB_right = B_left (since the current and distance are the same) = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment. Since the magnetic fields due to the top and bottom segments are pointing into the plane and the magnetic fields due to the left and right segments are pointing out of the plane, we can subtract the latter from the former:\n\nB_center = B_top + B_bottom - B_left - B_right\nB_center = 6.67 × 10^(-6) T + 6.67 × 10^(-6) T - 5 × 10^(-6) T - 5 × 10^(-6) T\nB_center = 3.34 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular wire loop is 3.34 × 10^(-6) T."
