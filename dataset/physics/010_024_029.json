    "message_2": "To calculate the central temperature of the star, we can use the Virial theorem, which states that the gravitational potential energy is equal to twice the internal kinetic energy of the star. We can express this as:\n\nU_grav = -2 * U_kin\n\nThe gravitational potential energy of the star can be calculated using the formula:\n\nU_grav = - (3 * G * M^2) / (5 * R)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, and R is its radius.\n\nThe internal kinetic energy of the star can be calculated using the ideal gas law:\n\nU_kin = (3/2) * N * k * T_c\n\nwhere N is the number of particles in the star, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10^-23 J K^-1), and T_c is the central temperature.\n\nTo find the number of particles in the star, we can use the mass and the mean molecular weight (μ):\n\nN = M / (μ * m_p)\n\nwhere m_p is the proton mass (1.6726219 × 10^-27 kg). For a star with a composition similar to the Sun, we can assume μ ≈ 0.6.\n\nNow, we can equate the expressions for U_grav and U_kin and solve for T_c:\n\n(3 * G * M^2) / (5 * R) = 3 * N * k * T_c\n\nPlugging in the values for the mass and radius of the star (5 times the mass of the Sun and 4 times the radius of the Sun), we get:\n\nT_c ≈ 1.57 × 10^7 K\n\nNow, to calculate the time it will take for the star to exhaust its nuclear fuel, we can use the mass-luminosity relation:\n\nL = M^3.5 * L_sun\n\nwhere L is the luminosity of the star, M is its mass, and L_sun is the luminosity of the Sun (3.828 × 10^26 W).\n\nFor the given star:\n\nL ≈ 5^3.5 * L_sun ≈ 279.5 * L_sun\n\nThe nuclear timescale (τ_nuc) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nτ_nuc = (E_nuc * M) / L\n\nwhere E_nuc is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass. For a star with a composition similar to the Sun, we can assume E_nuc ≈ 6.3 × 10^18 J kg^-1.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nτ_nuc ≈ (6.3 × 10^18 J kg^-1 * 5 * M_sun) / (279.5 * L_sun)\n\nτ_nuc ≈ 1.13 × 10^8 years\n\nSo, the central temperature of the star is approximately 1.57 × 10^7 K, and it will take about 1.13 × 10^8 years for the star to exhaust its nuclear fuel."
