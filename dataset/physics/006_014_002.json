    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the transition rate between two energy levels:\n\nR = (2π^2 * e^4 * Z^2) / (h^3 * c * n^3) * (1 / E_1 - 1 / E_2)\n\nwhere R is the transition rate, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), Z is the atomic number of hydrogen (1), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), n is the principal quantum number of the initial state (2 for the first excited state), E_1 is the energy of the initial state, and E_2 is the energy of the final state.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the first excited state (E_1) and the ground state (E_2) in joules:\n\nE_1 = 10.2 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.632 x 10^-18 J\nE_2 = -13.6 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = -2.176 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, let's calculate the transition rate R:\n\nR = (2π^2 * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^4 * 1^2) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)^3 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) * 2^3 * (1 / 1.632 x 10^-18 J - 1 / -2.176 x 10^-18 J)\nR ≈ 6.57 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nThe lifetime τ of the first excited state is the inverse of the transition rate:\n\nτ = 1 / R\nτ ≈ 1 / 6.57 x 10^6 s^-1\nτ ≈ 1.52 x 10^-7 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.52 x 10^-7 seconds."
