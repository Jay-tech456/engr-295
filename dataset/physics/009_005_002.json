    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the mirror (15 cm)\nu = distance of the object from the mirror (-20 cm, negative because the object is in front of the mirror)\nv = distance of the image from the mirror (which we need to find)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n1/15 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n1/v = 1/15 + 1/20 = (20 + 15) / (15 * 20) = 35 / 300\n\nSo, v = 300 / 35 = 60 / 7 cm (approximately 8.57 cm)\n\nSince the value of v is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the magnification formula:\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging the values, we get:\nm = -(60/7) / (-20) = (60/7) / 20 = 3 / 7 (approximately 0.43)\n\nSince the magnification is less than 1, the image is smaller than the object. Also, since the magnification is positive, the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real, inverted, and smaller image, located approximately 8.57 cm from the mirror."
