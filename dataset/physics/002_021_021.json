    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of methane in the mixture, we can use the following equation:\n\nfugacity = φ * x * P\n\nwhere:\n- fugacity is the fugacity of methane in the mixture\n- φ is the fugacity coefficient of methane in the mixture\n- x is the mole fraction of methane in the mixture\n- P is the total pressure of the mixture\n\nFirst, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ) of methane in the mixture. We can use the Peng-Robinson equation of state to estimate the fugacity coefficient. The Peng-Robinson equation of state is given by:\n\nP = (R * T) / (V - b) - a * α / (V^2 + 2 * b * V - b^2)\n\nwhere:\n- P is the pressure\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))\n- T is the temperature\n- V is the molar volume\n- a and b are the Peng-Robinson parameters\n- α is the temperature-dependent correction factor\n\nThe Peng-Robinson parameters a and b for methane and propane are given by:\n\na_methane = 2.283 * 10^5 Pa * (m^3/mol)^2\nb_methane = 4.291 * 10^-5 m^3/mol\n\na_propane = 4.724 * 10^5 Pa * (m^3/mol)^2\nb_propane = 1.153 * 10^-4 m^3/mol\n\nTo find the fugacity coefficient, we need to calculate the compressibility factor (Z) of the mixture. The compressibility factor is given by:\n\nZ = P * V / (R * T)\n\nWe can use the mixing rules for the Peng-Robinson equation of state to find the compressibility factor of the mixture:\n\na_mix = x_methane^2 * a_methane + 2 * x_methane * x_propane * sqrt(a_methane * a_propane) + x_propane^2 * a_propane\nb_mix = x_methane * b_methane + x_propane * b_propane\n\nwhere x_methane and x_propane are the mole fractions of methane and propane in the mixture, respectively.\n\nNow, we can solve the Peng-Robinson equation of state for the molar volume (V) of the mixture and calculate the compressibility factor (Z). Then, we can use the following equation to find the fugacity coefficient (φ) of methane in the mixture:\n\nφ_methane = exp((Z - 1) - ln(Z - P * b_mix / (R * T)) - a_mix * α_methane / (2 * sqrt(2) * b_mix * R * T) * ln((V + (1 + sqrt(2)) * b_mix) / (V + (1 - sqrt(2)) * b_mix)))\n\nFinally, we can use the fugacity equation to find the fugacity of methane in the mixture:\n\nfugacity_methane = φ_methane * x_methane * P\n\nGiven the temperature (298 K), pressure (10 bar), and mole fractions of methane (0.6) and propane (0.4), we can calculate the fugacity of methane in the mixture."
