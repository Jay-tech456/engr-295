    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric describes a charged black hole in general relativity. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is the charge of the black hole, and r is the radial coordinate.\n\nThe event horizon radius (r+) can be found by solving the equation:\n\n1 - 2M/r + Q²/r² = 0\n\nGiven the charge-to-mass ratio of 0.5, we have Q = 0.5M. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n1 - 2M/r + (0.5M)²/r² = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for r:\n\n1 - 2M/r + 0.25M²/r² = 0\nr² - 2Mr + 0.25M² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in r. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for r:\n\nr = (2M ± √(4M² - 4 * 0.25M²)) / 2\n\nr = (2M ± √(3M²)) / 2\n\nSince we are looking for the event horizon radius (r+), we take the positive root:\n\nr+ = (2M + √(3M²)) / 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the surface gravity (κ) of the charged black hole. The surface gravity is given by:\n\nκ = (1/2) * (d/dr) (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²) evaluated at r = r+\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to r, we get:\n\n(d/dr) (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²) = (2M/r² - 2Q²/r³)\n\nNow, we evaluate this at r = r+:\n\nκ = (1/2) * (2M/r+² - 2Q²/r+³)\n\nSubstituting r+ and Q = 0.5M, we get:\n\nκ = (1/2) * (2M/((2M + √(3M²))/2)² - 2(0.5M)²/((2M + √(3M²))/2)³)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nκ = (1/2) * (2 - 0.5) / (1 + √(3)/2)\n\nκ = (3/4) / (1 + √(3)/2)\n\nSo, the event horizon radius (r+) and surface gravity (κ) of a charged black hole with a charge-to-mass ratio of 0.5 are:\n\nr+ = (2M + √(3M²)) / 2\nκ = (3/4) / (1 + √(3)/2)"
