    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula for concave mirrors.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nMagnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf is the focal length of the mirror\nu is the distance between the object and the mirror\nv is the distance between the image and the mirror\nM is the magnification\n\nGiven that the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the image is three times smaller than the object, we can write the magnification as M = -1/3.\n\nNow, we can use the magnification formula to find the relationship between u and v:\n\n-1/3 = -v/u\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\nu = 3v\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for u into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/(3v) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/20 = (v + 3v) / (3v^2)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n3v^2 = 20(4v)\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\nv^2 = 20(4v) / 12\n\nv^2 = 80v / 12\n\nv^2 = 20v / 3\n\nNow, divide both sides by v:\n\nv = 20/3 cm\n\nNow that we have the value of v, we can find the value of u using the expression u = 3v:\n\nu = 3(20/3)\n\nu = 20 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the object and the concave mirror is 20 cm."
