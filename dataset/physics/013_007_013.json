    "message_2": "The rotation curve of the Milky Way Galaxy is a graph that represents the orbital velocities of stars and gas clouds as a function of their distance from the galactic center. In other words, it shows how fast different parts of the galaxy are rotating around its center.\n\nIn a simple model based on Newtonian gravity and the distribution of visible matter (stars, gas, and dust), we would expect the rotation curve to show a decrease in orbital velocity as we move further away from the galactic center. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible matter should decrease with distance, leading to slower orbital speeds.\n\nHowever, observations of the Milky Way's rotation curve do not follow this simple model. Instead, the curve remains relatively flat or even slightly increases with distance from the galactic center. This implies that there is more mass present in the outer regions of the galaxy than can be accounted for by the visible matter alone.\n\nThis discrepancy led to the hypothesis of dark matter, a form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible to telescopes. Dark matter is thought to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the galaxy, and its presence can explain the observed rotation curve.\n\nThe flat rotation curve of the Milky Way suggests that the mass distribution of both visible and dark matter in the galaxy is more extended than previously thought. The dark matter is believed to be distributed in a roughly spherical halo around the galaxy, with its density decreasing as we move further away from the center. This extended distribution of mass, including both visible and dark matter, is responsible for the observed flat rotation curve and has important implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of galaxies."
