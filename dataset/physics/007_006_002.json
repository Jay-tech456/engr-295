    "message_2": "Lead has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. In an FCC structure, the unit cell has lattice points at the corners and at the centers of each face. The diffraction pattern observed from a sample of lead with this crystal structure when illuminated by neutrons with a wavelength of 1 Å can be determined using Bragg's law and the Miller indices for the FCC structure.\n\nBragg's law states that nλ = 2d * sin(θ), where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength, d is the spacing between the crystal planes, and θ is the Bragg angle.\n\nFor an FCC structure, the Miller indices (h, k, l) must satisfy the condition h + k + l = even. Some possible combinations of Miller indices for the first few diffraction peaks are (1,1,1), (2,0,0), (2,2,0), and (2,2,2).\n\nThe lattice parameter (a) for lead is 4.95 Å. The spacing between the crystal planes (d) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = a / √(h² + k² + l²)\n\nFor each set of Miller indices, we can calculate the Bragg angle (θ) using Bragg's law:\n\nθ = arcsin(nλ / 2d)\n\nLet's calculate the Bragg angles and spacing between the crystal planes for the first few diffraction peaks:\n\n1. (1,1,1)\nd = 4.95 Å / √(1² + 1² + 1²) = 2.85 Å\nθ = arcsin(1 * 1 Å / (2 * 2.85 Å)) = 10.4°\n\n2. (2,0,0)\nd = 4.95 Å / √(2² + 0² + 0²) = 2.48 Å\nθ = arcsin(1 * 1 Å / (2 * 2.48 Å)) = 12.0°\n\n3. (2,2,0)\nd = 4.95 Å / √(2² + 2² + 0²) = 1.74 Å\nθ = arcsin(1 * 1 Å / (2 * 1.74 Å)) = 17.5°\n\n4. (2,2,2)\nd = 4.95 Å / √(2² + 2² + 2²) = 1.42 Å\nθ = arcsin(1 * 1 Å / (2 * 1.42 Å)) = 21.1°\n\nThe neutron diffraction pattern observed from a sample of lead with an FCC crystal structure when illuminated by neutrons with a wavelength of 1 Å would show diffraction peaks at Bragg angles of 10.4°, 12.0°, 17.5°, and 21.1°, corresponding to the Miller indices (1,1,1), (2,0,0), (2,2,0), and (2,2,2), respectively. The spacing between the crystal planes for these peaks would be 2.85 Å, 2.48 Å, 1.74 Å, and 1.42 Å, respectively."
