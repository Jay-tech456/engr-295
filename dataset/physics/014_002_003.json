    "message_2": "There are several key observations and theories that support the hypothesis that the universe began with the Big Bang. These include:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR): Discovered in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, the CMBR is the afterglow of the Big Bang. It is a nearly uniform radiation that fills the universe and has a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin. The existence of CMBR supports the idea that the universe was once in a hot, dense state.\n\n2. Hubble's Law: In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other, indicating that the universe is expanding. This observation supports the idea that the universe began as a single point and has been expanding ever since the Big Bang.\n\n3. Abundance of light elements: The Big Bang theory predicts the relative abundance of light elements (such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium) in the universe. Observations of these elements in the universe match the predictions made by the Big Bang theory, providing further support for the hypothesis.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory. The theory predicts that the universe should have evolved from small fluctuations in the early universe, which eventually led to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nSince the Big Bang, the universe has evolved in several ways:\n\n1. Expansion: The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, causing galaxies to move away from each other. This expansion is still ongoing and is even accelerating due to the influence of dark energy.\n\n2. Formation of galaxies and stars: As the universe expanded and cooled, matter began to clump together due to gravity. These clumps eventually formed galaxies, which are made up of billions of stars. Stars themselves form from clouds of gas and dust, and their nuclear reactions produce heavier elements.\n\n3. Formation of planets and other celestial bodies: Around some stars, the leftover material from their formation can come together to form planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. This process is known as planetary formation.\n\n4. Evolution of life: On at least one planet (Earth), conditions were suitable for the development of life. Life on Earth has evolved over billions of years, leading to the diverse array of species that exist today.\n\n5. Cosmic evolution: The universe continues to evolve, with stars forming and dying, galaxies merging, and the large-scale structure of the universe changing over time. The ultimate fate of the universe is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among cosmologists."
