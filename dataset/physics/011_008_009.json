    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a material for the onset of superconductivity is the temperature below which the material transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state, where it exhibits zero electrical resistance. The value of Tc depends on the specific material and its composition. For example, the critical temperature of elemental mercury is 4.2 K, while for some high-temperature superconductors, it can be as high as 138 K.\n\nThe critical temperature of a superconductor is affected by the strength of the applied magnetic field. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, as the magnetic field strength increases, the critical temperature decreases. This relationship can be described by the equation:\n\nTc(H) = Tc(0) * (1 - (H/Hc)^2)\n\nwhere Tc(H) is the critical temperature at a given magnetic field strength H, Tc(0) is the critical temperature at zero magnetic field, and Hc is the critical magnetic field strength at which superconductivity is completely suppressed.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for the emergence of superconductivity in a material is dependent on the type of superconductor. There are two main types of superconductors: conventional (or low-temperature) superconductors and high-temperature superconductors.\n\n1. Conventional superconductors: The mechanism responsible for superconductivity in these materials is well-understood and is described by the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory. According to this theory, superconductivity arises due to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by an attractive interaction mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). These Cooper pairs form a coherent quantum state, allowing them to move through the material without resistance.\n\n2. High-temperature superconductors: The mechanism responsible for superconductivity in these materials is not yet fully understood, and it is an active area of research. It is believed that the superconductivity in these materials is also due to the formation of Cooper pairs, but the attractive interaction between the electrons is likely mediated by a different mechanism than phonons. Some proposed mechanisms include spin fluctuations, bipolarons, and resonating valence bond states, but a consensus has not yet been reached."
