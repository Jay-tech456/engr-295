    "message_2": "The Bohr radius for a hydrogen atom when its electron is in the n=1 energy level can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere:\na₀ is the Bohr radius,\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²),\nħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js),\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg), and\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na₀ = (4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) * (1.054 x 10^(-34))^2) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius for a hydrogen atom when its electron is in the n=1 energy level is approximately 5.291 x 10^(-11) meters."
