    "message_2": "There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter in the universe:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This suggests that there is additional, unseen mass (dark matter) that is influencing the motion of these stars and gas.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant object, such as a galaxy or quasar, passes through a massive object like a galaxy cluster, its path is bent due to the gravitational influence of the massive object. This bending of light, called gravitational lensing, can be used to measure the mass of the massive object. Observations of gravitational lensing show that there is more mass in galaxy clusters than can be accounted for by the visible matter alone, indicating the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is influenced by the density and composition of matter in the universe. Measurements of the CMB are consistent with a universe that contains a significant amount of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, which take into account the effects of dark matter, are able to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n5. The Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, where the hot gas (visible matter) has been separated from the majority of the mass (dark matter) due to the collision. Observations of the Bullet Cluster provide direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the gravitational lensing signal is stronger in regions where the dark matter is located, rather than where the visible matter is concentrated.\n\nRegarding the estimated percentage of dark matter relative to normal matter, current measurements suggest that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while normal (baryonic) matter makes up about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe."
