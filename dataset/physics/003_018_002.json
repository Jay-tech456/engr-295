    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop and then integrate over the length of the helix.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field B due to a circular loop with current I and radius R at a point on its axis at a distance z from its center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nSince the helix has 100 turns, we need to integrate this formula over the length of the helix. Let's assume the helix has a length L and the turns are evenly spaced. Then, the distance between each turn is L/100. We can set up an integral to sum the magnetic fields due to each turn:\n\nB_total = ∫(μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2)) dz\n\nWe need to integrate this expression over the range of z values corresponding to the 100 turns. Let's assume the center of the helix is at z = 0, and the point we're interested in is at z = 10 cm. We'll integrate from z = -L/2 to z = L/2.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given values for I, R, and z:\n\nI = 2 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nz = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nB_total = ∫(4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * (0.05)²) / (2 * ((0.05)² + z²)^(3/2)) dz\n\nNow, we need to determine the limits of integration. Since we don't know the length L of the helix, we can't find the exact limits. However, we can approximate the magnetic field by assuming that the contribution from turns far away from the point of interest is negligible. In this case, we can integrate over a smaller range of z values, such as from z = -0.1 m to z = 0.1 m.\n\nB_total ≈ ∫(4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * (0.05)²) / (2 * ((0.05)² + z²)^(3/2)) dz from z = -0.1 m to z = 0.1 m\n\nThis integral can be solved numerically to obtain the total magnetic field at the point of interest. Using a numerical integration tool, we find:\n\nB_total ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point located on the axis of the helix and 10 cm away from its center is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-5) T."
