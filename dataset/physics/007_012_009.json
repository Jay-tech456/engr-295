    "message_2": "The fusion of deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H) is a nuclear reaction that occurs at extremely high temperatures. The minimum temperature required for this reaction to occur is around 40 million Kelvin (40 MK or 40 x 10^6 K). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei and allow them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion.\n\nThe reaction can be represented as:\n\n²H + ³H → ⁴He + n + energy\n\nwhere ²H is deuterium, ³H is tritium, ⁴He is helium-4, and n is a neutron.\n\nThe energy released in this reaction is approximately 17.6 MeV (million electron volts) per fusion event. This energy is primarily carried away by the helium-4 nucleus (3.5 MeV) and the neutron (14.1 MeV). This reaction is the basis for fusion energy research, as it has the potential to provide a clean and abundant source of energy."
