    "message_2": "The heat capacity of water is approximately 4.18 J/g°C (joules per gram per degree Celsius). Since we have 1 kilogram of water, which is equal to 1000 grams, the heat capacity of 1 kilogram of water is 1000 * 4.18 J/g°C = 4180 J/°C.\n\nTo calculate the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water by 10 degrees Celsius, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the energy required, m is the mass of the water, c is the heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, m = 1 kg (1000 g), c = 4180 J/°C, and ΔT = 10°C. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nQ = (1000 g) * (4180 J/°C) * (10°C) = 41800000 J\n\nSo, 41,800,000 joules of energy are required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water by 10 degrees Celsius."
