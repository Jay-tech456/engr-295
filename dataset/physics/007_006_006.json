    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the neutron, we can use Bragg's Law, which relates the angle of diffraction (θ), the lattice spacing (d), and the wavelength (λ) of the diffracted particle:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nHere, n is the order of diffraction (we'll assume n=1 for the first order), d is the lattice spacing (0.5 nm), and θ is the angle of diffraction (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Bragg's Law:\n\n1 * λ = 2 * 0.5 nm * sin(π/6)\nλ = 1 nm * sin(π/6)\nλ ≈ 0.5 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the neutron is approximately 0.5 nm."
