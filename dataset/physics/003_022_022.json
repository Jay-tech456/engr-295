    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for a physics student to solve:\n\nA motor has a current of 5 amperes flowing through a wire that is coiled around a cylinder with a radius of 0.25 meters. Calculate the magnetic field at a point that is located 0.1 meters away from the center of the cylinder along the axis of the coil.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. The formula for the magnetic field at a point along the axis of a solenoid (cylinder with wire coiled around it) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I) / 2\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nHowever, we are given the radius of the cylinder (0.25 meters) and the distance from the center of the cylinder to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field (0.1 meters). To find the magnetic field at this point, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field along the axis of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the cylinder, and x is the distance from the center of the cylinder to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.25 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.25 m)^2 + (0.1 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (6.28 × 10^(-7) T * 5 * 0.0625) / (2 * (0.0625 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (1.9635 × 10^(-7) T) / (2 * (0.0725)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (1.9635 × 10^(-7) T) / (2 * 0.0201)\n\nB ≈ 4.88 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point 0.1 meters away from the center of the cylinder along the axis of the coil is approximately 4.88 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
