    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field intensity at a point 2 meters above the center of the sheet, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to an infinitesimal current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the sheet is rectangular and carrying a uniform current, we can divide the sheet into infinitesimal current-carrying wires parallel to the shorter side (0.5 m) of the rectangle. Let's consider an infinitesimal wire of length dx at a distance x from the longer side (1 m) of the rectangle.\n\nThe magnetic field due to this infinitesimal wire at the point P can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law for a straight wire:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx) / (x² + y²)^(3/2)\n\nwhere y is the distance from the point P to the plane of the sheet (2 m in this case).\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire length of the sheet (from x = 0 to x = 1 m) to find the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to 1\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dx) / (x² + y²)^(3/2) from 0 to 1\n\nSince the current I and the distance y are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dx) / (x² + y²)^(3/2) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values of I and y:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A / 4π) * ∫(dx) / (x² + 2²)^(3/2) from 0 to 1\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * ∫(dx) / (x² + 4)^(3/2) from 0 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let x = 2 * tan(θ), then dx = 2 * sec²(θ) * dθ:\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * ∫(2 * sec²(θ) * dθ) / (4 * tan²(θ) + 4)^(3/2) from θ = arctan(0) to θ = arctan(1/2)\n\nSimplify the integral:\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * ∫(2 * sec²(θ) * dθ) / (4 * sec²(θ))^(3/2) from θ = 0 to θ = arctan(1/2)\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * ∫(dθ) / sec(θ) from θ = 0 to θ = arctan(1/2)\n\nNow, we can integrate and substitute the limits:\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * [ln(sec(θ) + tan(θ))] from θ = 0 to θ = arctan(1/2)\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * [ln(sec(arctan(1/2)) + tan(arctan(1/2))) - ln(sec(0) + tan(0))]\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * [ln(2 + 1/2) - ln(1)]\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field intensity:\n\nB = (5 × 10^(-7) Tm) * ln(5/2)\nB ≈ 3.44 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at a point 2 meters above the center of the sheet is approximately 3.44 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
