    "message_2": "The mathematical framework for calculating effective field theories (EFTs) in quantum field theory (QFT) is based on the principles of renormalization group and perturbation theory. EFTs are a powerful tool for describing low-energy phenomena in particle physics, as they allow us to focus on the relevant degrees of freedom and interactions at a given energy scale, while integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom.\n\nThe main steps in constructing an EFT are as follows:\n\n1. Identify the relevant degrees of freedom: Determine the particles and fields that are relevant at the energy scale of interest. This typically involves separating the fields into low-energy and high-energy components.\n\n2. Write down the most general Lagrangian: Construct the most general Lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory, involving only the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom. This Lagrangian will contain an infinite number of terms, ordered by their mass dimension.\n\n3. Renormalization group and power counting: Use the renormalization group equations to analyze the running of coupling constants with the energy scale. This helps to identify the relevant operators in the EFT and to organize the terms in the Lagrangian according to their importance at a given energy scale. Power counting rules are used to estimate the size of various terms in the Lagrangian.\n\n4. Perturbative expansion: Expand the EFT Lagrangian in terms of a small parameter, typically the ratio of the low-energy scale to the high-energy scale. This allows us to truncate the Lagrangian at a certain order in the expansion and to calculate physical observables using perturbation theory.\n\n5. Matching and renormalization: Match the EFT to the underlying high-energy theory by requiring that the two theories give the same results for physical observables up to a certain order in the perturbative expansion. This determines the coefficients of the operators in the EFT Lagrangian. Renormalization is then used to absorb the divergences that arise in the perturbative calculations.\n\nBy following these steps, one can construct an EFT that accurately describes low-energy phenomena in particle physics, while systematically accounting for the effects of high-energy degrees of freedom. This approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including the study of the strong nuclear force (using chiral perturbation theory), the electroweak interactions (using the Standard Model EFT), and even the physics of black holes and gravitational waves (using the effective field theory of gravity)."
