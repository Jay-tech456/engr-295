    "message_2": "The renormalization procedure is a technique used in quantum field theory, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED), to address the issue of infinite values that arise in calculations for the electron's self-energy and other quantities. These infinities are a result of the interaction between the electron and the electromagnetic field, which leads to divergent integrals in the perturbation series.\n\nThe main idea behind renormalization is to absorb these infinite quantities into the redefinition of physical parameters, such as the electron's mass and charge, rendering the final results finite and physically meaningful. This is achieved through the process of subtracting and adding counterterms.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the renormalization procedure:\n\n1. Calculate the bare quantities: Start by calculating the \"bare\" quantities, such as the electron's self-energy, which are the unrenormalized values that contain infinities.\n\n2. Identify the divergences: Identify the divergent parts of the bare quantities that lead to infinite values.\n\n3. Introduce counterterms: Add counterterms to the bare quantities, which are specifically designed to cancel out the divergent parts. These counterterms also contain infinities but are constructed in such a way that they exactly cancel the infinities in the bare quantities.\n\n4. Redefine physical parameters: Absorb the infinite parts of the counterterms into the redefinition of physical parameters, such as the electron's mass and charge. This process is called renormalization, and the resulting quantities are called renormalized quantities.\n\n5. Calculate renormalized quantities: Perform calculations using the renormalized quantities, which now have finite values. These calculations will yield finite and physically meaningful results.\n\n6. Compare with experimental data: Compare the predictions obtained using the renormalized quantities with experimental data to verify the validity of the renormalization procedure.\n\nIn summary, the renormalization procedure addresses the infinite values that arise in QED calculations for the electron's self-energy by subtracting and adding counterterms, which cancel out the divergent parts and lead to finite and physically meaningful results. This technique has been proven to be successful in providing accurate predictions that match experimental data and is an essential tool in the study of quantum field theory."
