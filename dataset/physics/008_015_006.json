    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, fundamental particles acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field, which is a scalar field that permeates all of space. The Higgs field is associated with the Higgs boson, a particle discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nThe Higgs mechanism, which explains how particles acquire mass, is based on the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In a vacuum, the Higgs field has a non-zero value, known as the vacuum expectation value (VEV). This non-zero value breaks the electroweak symmetry, which is the symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.\n\nWhen fundamental particles, such as quarks and leptons, interact with the Higgs field, they acquire mass through a process called the Yukawa interaction. The strength of the interaction between a particle and the Higgs field is determined by the Yukawa coupling constant, which is different for each type of particle. The larger the coupling constant, the stronger the interaction, and the more massive the particle becomes.\n\nIn the case of gauge bosons, such as the W and Z bosons that mediate the weak nuclear force, they acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field as well. The photon, which mediates the electromagnetic force, does not interact with the Higgs field and remains massless.\n\nIn summary, the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model of particle physics explains how fundamental particles acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field. The strength of the interaction is determined by the Yukawa coupling constant, which varies for different particles, resulting in different masses for different particles."
