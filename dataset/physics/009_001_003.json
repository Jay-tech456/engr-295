    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and water in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nWe are given the refractive index of water with respect to air (n2/n1) as 1.33, the angle of refraction (θ2) as 30 degrees, and we need to find the angle of incidence (θ1).\n\nLet's rearrange Snell's Law to solve for θ1:\n\nθ1 = arcsin((n2 * sin(θ2)) / n1)\n\nSince n2/n1 = 1.33, we can write:\n\nθ1 = arcsin((1.33 * sin(30°)) / 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1.33 * 0.5)\nθ1 = arcsin(0.665)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.8°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence of the light ray is approximately 41.8 degrees."
