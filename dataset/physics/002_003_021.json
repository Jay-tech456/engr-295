    "message_2": "To calculate the final internal energy of the gas, we first need to find the work done by the gas during the expansion. We can use the formula for work done at constant pressure:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial = 5 L - 1 L = 4 L\n\nNow, we can convert the volume from liters to cubic meters:\n\n1 L = 0.001 m³\n\nΔV = 4 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.004 m³\n\nNext, we need to convert the pressure from atm to pascals:\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nP = 2 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 202650 Pa\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = P * ΔV = 202650 Pa * 0.004 m³ = 810.6 J\n\nSince the gas is expanding, the work done is positive. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nHowever, we are not given the heat added to the system. Instead, we can use the initial internal energy (U_initial) and the final internal energy (U_final) to find the change in internal energy:\n\nΔU = U_final - U_initial\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to find the final internal energy:\n\nU_final = ΔU + U_initial\n\nSince the work done is positive, the internal energy of the gas will decrease:\n\nΔU = -W = -810.6 J\n\nNow, we can find the final internal energy:\n\nU_final = ΔU + U_initial = -810.6 J + 50 J = -760.6 J\n\nHowever, the internal energy of a system cannot be negative. This means that there is an inconsistency in the given data, and the problem cannot be solved with the given information."
