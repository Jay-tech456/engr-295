    "message_2": "The minimum sound intensity level that a human with normal hearing can detect is called the threshold of hearing. This threshold varies with frequency, and the human auditory system is most sensitive to frequencies between 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz. At 2000 Hz, the threshold of hearing is approximately 0 dB.\n\nTo understand this, we need to discuss the decibel scale and the physics behind it. The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, such as sound intensity. The formula for calculating sound intensity level (L) in decibels is:\n\nL = 10 * log10(I/I0)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the sound, I0 is the reference intensity, and log10 is the base-10 logarithm. The reference intensity (I0) is typically set to the threshold of human hearing, which is 10^-12 W/m^2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum sound intensity level at a frequency of 2000 Hz that a human with normal hearing can detect. Since the threshold of hearing at 2000 Hz is 0 dB, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\n0 dB = 10 * log10(I/10^-12 W/m^2)\n\nTo solve for I, we first divide both sides by 10:\n\n0 = log10(I/10^-12 W/m^2)\n\nNow, we can use the inverse of the logarithm function, which is the power of 10, to find the intensity:\n\n10^0 = I/10^-12 W/m^2\n\n1 = I/10^-12 W/m^2\n\nI = 10^-12 W/m^2\n\nSo, the minimum sound intensity level at a frequency of 2000 Hz that a human with normal hearing can detect is 10^-12 W/m^2, which corresponds to 0 dB on the decibel scale.\n\nIn summary, the human auditory system is most sensitive to frequencies between 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz. At 2000 Hz, the threshold of hearing is approximately 0 dB, which corresponds to a sound intensity of 10^-12 W/m^2. This is the minimum sound intensity level that a human with normal hearing can detect at this frequency."
