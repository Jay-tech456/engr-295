    "message_2": "To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box with infinite potential walls at x=0 and x=L, we first need to set up the equation. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\nHψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian operator, ψ(x) is the wavefunction, and E is the energy of the system. For a one-dimensional box, the Hamiltonian operator is given by:\n\nH = -ħ²/(2m) * (d²/dx²)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and m is the mass of the particle. The potential energy V(x) inside the box is zero, and it is infinite at the walls. Therefore, the time-independent Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n-ħ²/(2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nTo solve this second-order differential equation, we can propose a solution of the form:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k is the wave number. Applying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\n1) ψ(0) = 0: This implies that B = 0, since cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0.\n2) ψ(L) = 0: This implies that sin(kL) = 0, which means kL = nπ, where n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nSo, the wavefunction becomes:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n * sin(nπx/L)\n\nTo normalize the wavefunction, we need to find the constant A_n:\n\n∫[ψ_n(x)]² dx = 1, where the integral is taken over the range [0, L].\n\nAfter integrating and solving for A_n, we find that:\n\nA_n = sqrt(2/L)\n\nThus, the normalized wavefunction is:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nNow, let's find the allowed energy states. From the condition kL = nπ, we have:\n\nk = nπ/L\n\nThe energy E is related to the wave number k by the equation:\n\nE = ħ²k²/(2m)\n\nSubstituting the expression for k, we get:\n\nE_n = ħ²(nπ/L)²/(2m) = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nSo, the allowed energy states are:\n\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nIn summary, for a particle in a one-dimensional box with infinite potential walls at x=0 and x=L, the allowed energy states are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), and the corresponding wavefunctions are ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L), where n is a positive integer."
