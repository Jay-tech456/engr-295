    "message_1": "Imagine you are standing on earth and observing a spacecraft traveling at a speed of 0.9c, where c is the speed of light. You calculate the angle between the spacecraft and the direction of the incoming light rays from a distant star to be 60 degrees. What will be the angle between the spacecraft and the direction of the light rays as observed by someone aboard the spacecraft? Use the concept of relativistic aberration of light to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle between the spacecraft and the direction of the light rays as observed by someone aboard the spacecraft, we can use the relativistic aberration formula:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ)))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the spacecraft and the direction of the incoming light rays as observed from Earth (60 degrees), θ' is the angle we want to find, v is the speed of the spacecraft (0.9c), c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can use the relativistic aberration formula to find the angle θ':\n\nsin(θ') = sin(60°) / (2.294(1 + (0.9c/c)cos(60°)))\nsin(θ') = sin(60°) / (2.294(1 + 0.9cos(60°)))\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.866 / (2.294(1 + 0.45))\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.866 / (2.294 * 1.45)\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.866 / 3.326\nsin(θ') ≈ 0.260\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ':\n\nθ' = arcsin(0.260)\nθ' ≈ 15.2°\n\nSo, the angle between the spacecraft and the direction of the light rays as observed by someone aboard the spacecraft is approximately 15.2 degrees."
