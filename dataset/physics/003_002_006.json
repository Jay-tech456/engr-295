    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law. For a solenoid with n turns per unit length, length L, and radius R, when a current I flows through it, the magnetic field B inside the solenoid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nAt the center of the solenoid, the magnetic field B will have the same value as the magnetic field inside the solenoid, since the field is approximately uniform inside a long solenoid. Therefore, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is:\n\nB_center = μ₀ * n * I"
