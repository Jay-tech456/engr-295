    "message_2": "To determine the expected amplitude, frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes, we can use the following information:\n\n1. Masses of the black holes: M1 = 30 solar masses, M2 = 40 solar masses\n2. Distance to the black holes: D = 1 billion light-years\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 30 + 40 = 70 solar masses\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (30 * 40) / 70 ≈ 17.14 solar masses\n\nNext, we can calculate the chirp mass (M_chirp), which is a combination of the total mass and reduced mass:\n\nM_chirp = μ^(3/5) * M^(2/5) ≈ 17.14^(3/5) * 70^(2/5) ≈ 49.13 solar masses\n\nNow, let's convert the distance and chirp mass to SI units:\n\nD = 1 billion light-years * 9.461e+15 m/light-year ≈ 9.461e+24 m\nM_chirp = 49.13 solar masses * 1.989e+30 kg/solar mass ≈ 9.77e+31 kg\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh ≈ (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-1))^(1/3) * (π * f)^(2/3) * D^(-1)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674e-11 m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)), c is the speed of light (3e+8 m/s), and f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves during the coalescence can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf ≈ (c^3 / G * M)^(1/2) * π^(-1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency:\n\nf ≈ (3e+8 m/s)^3 / (6.674e-11 m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 70 * 1.989e+30 kg)^(1/2) * π^(-1) ≈ 157 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nh ≈ (4 * 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 9.77e+31 kg * (3e+8 m/s)^(-1))^(1/3) * (π * 157 Hz)^(2/3) * (9.461e+24 m)^(-1) ≈ 1.22e-22\n\nSo, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves is approximately 1.22e-22, and the frequency is approximately 157 Hz.\n\nTo estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the LIGO detector, we would need to know the detector's sensitivity and noise characteristics, which can vary depending on the specific configuration and observing run. However, the amplitude and frequency calculated above can be used as input to more detailed models of LIGO's sensitivity to determine the expected SNR."
