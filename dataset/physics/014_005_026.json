    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the large-scale structure of the universe and significantly affects the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Although dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, it can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. It is estimated that dark matter constitutes approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (baryonic matter) makes up only about 5%.\n\nThe role of dark matter in the large-scale structure of the universe can be summarized in the following points:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to hold galaxies and clusters of galaxies together. Without dark matter, the observed motion of galaxies and their distribution in the universe could not be explained by the gravitational effects of visible matter alone.\n\n2. Cosmic web: Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, which is the large-scale structure of the universe. This cosmic web consists of vast filaments of dark matter that connect galaxy clusters and span across the universe. Galaxies and galaxy clusters are primarily located along these filaments, where the density of dark matter is higher.\n\n3. Galaxy formation and evolution: Dark matter plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. It is believed that dark matter halos, which are regions of high dark matter density, act as the seeds for galaxy formation. These halos attract baryonic matter through gravity, leading to the formation of stars and galaxies within them. The distribution and properties of dark matter halos influence the properties of the galaxies that form within them, such as their size, shape, and rotation.\n\n4. Cosmic expansion: Dark matter affects the rate of cosmic expansion, as its gravitational pull works against the expansion driven by dark energy. The balance between dark matter and dark energy determines the overall geometry and fate of the universe.\n\nIn summary, dark matter plays a vital role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe and the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Its gravitational effects are essential for the formation, stability, and evolution of cosmic structures, as well as influencing the overall expansion of the universe."
