    "message_1": "What is the minimum angle of incidence that a light beam must have in order to remain within a step-index optical fiber with a core refractive index of 1.5, when the fiber cladding has a refractive index of 1.4? The core diameter is 2 mm, and the wavelength of the light is 600 nm.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the critical angle at which total internal reflection occurs at the core-cladding interface. This will ensure that the light beam remains within the optical fiber. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle.\n\nSnell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. At the critical angle, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees, and sin(90) = 1.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, we have:\n\nn_core * sin(θ_critical) = n_cladding * sin(90)\n\nRearranging for θ_critical, we get:\n\nsin(θ_critical) = (n_cladding / n_core)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nsin(θ_critical) = (1.4 / 1.5)\n\nθ_critical = arcsin(1.4 / 1.5)\n\nθ_critical ≈ 68.2 degrees\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for the light beam to remain within the step-index optical fiber is approximately 68.2 degrees."
