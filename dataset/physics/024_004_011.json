    "message_2": "The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx_{n+1} = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population at time n, and r is the parameter that controls the growth rate.\n\nThe transition from a stable fixed point to a stable periodic orbit of period 2 occurs at the first bifurcation point. To find this value, we first need to find the fixed points of the logistic map. Fixed points are the values of x for which x_{n+1} = x_n. So, we have:\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nNow, we can find the stability of these fixed points by taking the derivative of the logistic map equation with respect to x:\n\ndx_{n+1}/dx_n = r - 2 * r * x_n\n\nThe fixed point is stable if the absolute value of the derivative is less than 1. For the first bifurcation point, the stability condition changes from stable to unstable, so we have:\n\nabs(r - 2 * r * x) = 1\n\nAt the first bifurcation point, the fixed point x is 1/2, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nabs(r - 2 * r * (1/2)) = 1\nabs(r - r) = 1\nabs(0) = 1\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that the first bifurcation point occurs when the fixed point x = 1/2 becomes unstable. To find the value of r at this point, we can use the stability condition:\n\nabs(r - 2 * r * x) > 1\n\nSubstituting x = 1/2, we get:\n\nabs(r - r) > 1\nabs(0) > 1\n\nThis inequality is not true, so we need to consider the other fixed point x = 0. The stability condition for this fixed point is:\n\nabs(r) > 1\n\nThis inequality is true for r > 1. Therefore, the logistic map transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable periodic orbit of period 2 at r = 1. The corresponding bifurcation parameter is r = 1."
