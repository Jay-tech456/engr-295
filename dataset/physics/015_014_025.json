    "message_2": "To estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting gravitational waves emitted from a primordial black hole (PBH) population with a mass range of 10-100 solar masses using a ground-based interferometer like LIGO at a distance of 100 Mpc from Earth, we need to consider several factors.\n\n1. The sensitivity of the detector: LIGO's sensitivity is frequency-dependent, with the best sensitivity in the range of ~10 Hz to ~1000 Hz. The sensitivity is often represented by the noise power spectral density, which is denoted as Sn(f).\n\n2. The strain amplitude of the gravitational wave signal: The strain amplitude h depends on the masses of the black holes, the distance to the source, and the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. For a binary black hole system, the characteristic strain amplitude hc can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nhc(f) = sqrt(2 * f * dE/df) / (4 * pi * c^2 * r)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, dE/df is the energy emitted per unit frequency, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance to the source (100 Mpc in this case).\n\n3. The energy spectrum of the gravitational waves: The energy emitted per unit frequency dE/df depends on the masses of the black holes and the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. For a binary black hole system, the energy spectrum can be estimated using the post-Newtonian approximation.\n\n4. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): The SNR can be calculated by integrating the ratio of the square of the characteristic strain amplitude hc(f) to the noise power spectral density Sn(f) over the frequency range of interest:\n\nSNR = sqrt(4 * âˆ« (hc(f)^2 / Sn(f)) df)\n\nTo estimate the expected SNR for detecting gravitational waves from a PBH population with a mass range of 10-100 solar masses, we would need to perform this calculation for different combinations of black hole masses within this range and then average the results to obtain an overall expected SNR.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a simplified estimation, and a more accurate calculation would require detailed modeling of the PBH population, the detector's sensitivity, and the waveform templates used for matched filtering in the data analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, estimating the expected SNR for detecting gravitational waves from a PBH population with a mass range of 10-100 solar masses using LIGO at a distance of 100 Mpc requires a detailed analysis of the detector's sensitivity, the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave signal, and the energy spectrum of the emitted waves. The actual SNR will depend on these factors and the specific properties of the PBH population."
