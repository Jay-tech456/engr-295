    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the product of the refractive index and the sine of the angle of incidence is equal to the product of the refractive index and the sine of the angle of refraction for each interface.\n\nLet's denote the angle of incidence in the first interface as θ1, the angle of refraction in the first interface as θ2, and the angle of refraction in the second interface as θ3.\n\nFor the first interface (air to medium 1), we have:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), and n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of medium 1).\n\nFor the second interface (medium 1 to medium 2), we have:\n\nn2 * sin(θ2) = n3 * sin(θ3)\n\nwhere n3 = 1.25 (refractive index of medium 2), and θ3 = 30 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of sin(θ2) from the second equation:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ2) = 1.25 * sin(30°)\nsin(θ2) = (1.25 * 0.5) / 1.5\nsin(θ2) = 0.4167\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ2:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4167)\nθ2 ≈ 24.9°\n\nNow we can find the angle of incidence θ1 using the first equation:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\nsin(θ1) = 1.5 * sin(24.9°)\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.625\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ1:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.625)\nθ1 ≈ 38.2°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence at the first interface is approximately 38.2 degrees."
