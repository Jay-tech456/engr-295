    "message_2": "To calculate the specific absorption rate (SAR) of a human cell when exposed to electromagnetic radiation, we need to know the following parameters:\n\n1. The power density (S) of the electromagnetic radiation, typically measured in watts per square meter (W/m²).\n2. The frequency (f) of the electromagnetic radiation, measured in hertz (Hz).\n3. The mass (m) of the human cell, measured in kilograms (kg).\n4. The conductivity (σ) of the human cell, measured in siemens per meter (S/m).\n5. The dielectric constant (ε) of the human cell, measured in farads per meter (F/m).\n\nThe SAR can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nSAR = (σ * E²) / (2 * ρ)\n\nwhere E is the electric field intensity, measured in volts per meter (V/m), and ρ is the mass density of the human cell, measured in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³).\n\nTo find the electric field intensity (E), we can use the following formula:\n\nE = √(2 * S / (μ₀ * c))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m) and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\nOnce we have the electric field intensity (E), we can calculate the SAR using the formula mentioned above.\n\nHowever, without the specific values for power density, frequency, mass, conductivity, and dielectric constant of the human cell, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the SAR. If you provide these values, we can help you calculate the SAR."
