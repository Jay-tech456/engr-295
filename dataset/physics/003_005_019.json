    "message_1": "A long straight wire has a current of 2.5 A flowing through it. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance from a long straight wire, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 2.5 A and the distance r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.05\n\nB = 0.0000025 T / 0.05\n\nB ≈ 0.00005 T or 50 μT\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. So, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the current's direction."
