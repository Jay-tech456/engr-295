    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, and it is associated with the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving mass to other particles. The mass of the Higgs boson is approximately 125.1 GeV/cÂ² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), as confirmed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\n\nThe Higgs boson interacts with other particles in the Standard Model through a process called the Higgs mechanism. When particles pass through the Higgs field, they acquire mass by interacting with the Higgs bosons. The strength of this interaction is proportional to the mass of the particle. In other words, heavier particles interact more strongly with the Higgs field and Higgs bosons, while lighter particles interact more weakly.\n\nThe Higgs boson can also decay into other particles, such as a pair of W or Z bosons, a pair of photons, or a pair of fermions (quarks or leptons). The probability of each decay mode depends on the mass of the Higgs boson and the masses of the particles it decays into. Since the Higgs boson is unstable, it decays almost immediately after being produced in high-energy collisions, such as those at the LHC. The detection of these decay products is how physicists have been able to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson and measure its properties."
