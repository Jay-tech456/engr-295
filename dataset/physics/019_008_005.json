    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is a measure of the deviation of the electron's magnetic moment from its classical value, which is given by the Dirac equation. The anomalous magnetic moment arises due to the interaction of the electron with virtual particles, which are taken into account in perturbation theory.\n\nWhen considering contributions up to the second order of perturbation theory, the most significant contribution comes from the one-loop Feynman diagram, which involves the interaction of the electron with a virtual photon. This contribution is given by the famous Schwinger's formula:\n\na_e = (g_e - 2) / 2 = α / (2π)\n\nHere, a_e is the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, g_e is the electron's g-factor, α is the fine-structure constant (approximately equal to 1/137), and π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\nSo, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron up to the second order of perturbation theory is:\n\na_e ≈ α / (2π) ≈ 1 / (2 * 137 * π) ≈ 0.00116\n\nThis result is in agreement with experimental measurements, and it is one of the most precise predictions in quantum field theory. Higher-order contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment can also be calculated, but they are much smaller and more challenging to compute."
