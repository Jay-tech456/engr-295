    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (0.05 meters in this case) centered on the wire as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field is constant along this loop, so we can simplify the equation as:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the integral of dl around the circular loop is equal to the circumference of the loop (2πr), we can write:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current (I) is 5 A, and the distance (r) is 0.05 meters. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 5 A) / (2π × 0.05 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 5 A) / (2 × 0.05 m)\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the wire is 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
