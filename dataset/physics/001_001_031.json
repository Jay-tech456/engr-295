Therefore, the allowed wave numbers k are:\n\nk_n = nπ/L\n\nThe corresponding allowed energy levels E_n are:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * k_n²) / (2m) = (ħ² * n²π²) / (2mL²)\n\nFinally, the normalized wavefunctions ψ_n(x) for the allowed energy levels are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nIn summary, the allowed energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional box with infinite potential walls are:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * n²π²) / (2mL²)\n\nand the corresponding wavefunctions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)"
