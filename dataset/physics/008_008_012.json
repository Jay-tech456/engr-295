    "message_2": "Supersymmetric particles, also known as sparticles, are hypothetical partners of the known Standard Model particles. They are predicted by supersymmetry (SUSY), a theoretical extension of the Standard Model that aims to solve some of its limitations, such as the hierarchy problem and the unification of forces. The decay modes of supersymmetric particles depend on the specific sparticle and the details of the supersymmetric model being considered.\n\nIn general, sparticles decay into lighter sparticles and Standard Model particles through various decay channels. Some common decay modes include:\n\n1. Direct decay: A heavier sparticle decays directly into a lighter sparticle and a Standard Model particle, e.g., a squark (supersymmetric quark) decaying into a quark and a neutralino.\n\n2. Cascade decay: A heavier sparticle decays into a series of lighter sparticles and Standard Model particles through multiple steps, e.g., a gluino (supersymmetric gluon) decaying into a squark and a quark, followed by the squark decaying into a quark and a neutralino.\n\n3. Leptonic decay: A supersymmetric particle decays into leptons, such as electrons, muons, or taus, and their corresponding neutrinos, e.g., a slepton (supersymmetric lepton) decaying into a lepton and a neutralino.\n\n4. Hadronic decay: A supersymmetric particle decays into quarks and gluons, which then hadronize into jets of particles, e.g., a squark decaying into a quark and a gluino, followed by the gluino decaying into a quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino.\n\nThe search for supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves looking for signatures of these decay modes in the data collected from proton-proton collisions. Since sparticles are expected to be heavier than their Standard Model counterparts, their production and decay would result in events with large amounts of missing energy (due to undetected neutralinos, which are often assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle and a candidate for dark matter) and high-energy jets or leptons.\n\nExperimental searches at the LHC typically focus on specific decay modes and final states, such as events with multiple jets, leptons, and missing energy, or events with specific combinations of particles, like same-sign dileptons or opposite-sign dijets. By comparing the observed event rates and distributions with the predictions from the Standard Model and various supersymmetric models, physicists can either discover evidence for supersymmetry or set limits on the masses and couplings of the hypothetical sparticles. So far, no conclusive evidence for supersymmetry has been found at the LHC, but the search continues, and future data and upgrades to the collider may provide further insights."
