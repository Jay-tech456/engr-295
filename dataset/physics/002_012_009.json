    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the system during an isothermal process, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 0.1 moles\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\nT = 300 K\nVi = 0.02 m³\nVf = 0.01 m³\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nW = (0.1 moles) * (8.314 J/(mol*K)) * (300 K) * ln(0.01 m³ / 0.02 m³)\nW = 0.1 * 8.314 * 300 * ln(0.5)\nW ≈ 207.42 * ln(0.5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the natural logarithm of 0.5:\n\nln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931\n\nNow, we can multiply this value by the previous result:\n\nW ≈ 207.42 * (-0.6931)\nW ≈ -143.6 J\n\nThe work done by the system is approximately -143.6 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the system (the gas) on the surroundings (the piston)."
