    "message_2": "When information falls into a black hole, it seemingly disappears from our observable universe. This apparent loss of information poses a significant challenge in theoretical physics, known as the black hole information paradox. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, information should never be lost, but black holes seem to violate this rule.\n\nThe properties of a black hole are determined by three parameters: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum (spin). These properties can be affected by the infalling matter and energy. As the black hole consumes matter, its mass increases, and if the infalling matter carries charge or angular momentum, these properties will also change accordingly.\n\nIn 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes can emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This radiation is due to quantum effects near the event horizon, where virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created. One of the particles falls into the black hole while the other escapes, causing the black hole to lose mass over time. This process is extremely slow for large black holes but becomes significant for smaller ones.\n\nThe discovery of Hawking radiation led to the idea that black holes could eventually evaporate, raising the question of what happens to the information inside them. One possible resolution to the information paradox is that the information is somehow encoded in the Hawking radiation and is released back into the universe as the black hole evaporates. However, this process is not yet fully understood, and the exact mechanism by which information could be preserved remains an open question in theoretical physics.\n\nAnother possibility is that the information is stored in a holographic manner on the event horizon or in some other structure, such as a \"firewall\" or a \"fuzzball.\" These ideas suggest that the information is not lost but rather transformed and stored in a way that is not yet fully understood.\n\nIn summary, the information that falls into a black hole affects its properties such as mass, charge, and angular momentum. The ultimate fate of this information is still an open question in theoretical physics, with several proposed solutions to the black hole information paradox, including encoding in Hawking radiation or storing it in a holographic manner."
