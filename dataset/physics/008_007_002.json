    "message_2": "The masses of W and Z bosons, which are fundamental particles in the electroweak force, are measured using experimental techniques in particle physics. The primary method for measuring their masses is through high-energy particle collisions at particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The following experimental techniques are used:\n\n1. Resonance peak analysis: The W and Z bosons are unstable particles and decay into other particles shortly after being produced in high-energy collisions. By analyzing the invariant mass distribution of the decay products, a resonance peak can be identified, which corresponds to the mass of the W or Z boson. For example, the Z boson can decay into a pair of leptons (electron-positron or muon-antimuon), while the W boson can decay into a lepton and a neutrino.\n\n2. Transverse mass analysis: In the case of W boson decays, the neutrino escapes detection, making it challenging to reconstruct the invariant mass directly. Instead, the transverse mass, which is calculated using the detected lepton's energy and momentum components perpendicular to the beam direction, is used as a proxy for the W boson mass.\n\n3. Template fitting: The mass distributions obtained from experimental data are compared to theoretical predictions (templates) generated using Monte Carlo simulations. By fitting the templates to the data, the masses of the W and Z bosons can be extracted.\n\n4. Combination of measurements: To improve the precision of the mass measurements, results from different decay channels, experiments, and collider energies are combined using statistical methods.\n\nThe uncertainty in the mass measurements of W and Z bosons is mainly due to experimental uncertainties (such as detector resolution, energy scale calibration, and background estimation) and theoretical uncertainties (such as the choice of parton distribution functions and higher-order corrections). The current world-average values for the W and Z boson masses, as reported by the Particle Data Group, are:\n\n- W boson mass: 80.379 ± 0.012 GeV/c²\n- Z boson mass: 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV/c²\n\nThese uncertainties correspond to relative precisions of about 0.015% for the W boson mass and 0.0023% for the Z boson mass."
