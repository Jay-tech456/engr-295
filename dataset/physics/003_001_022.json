    "message_1": "A wire carrying a current of 5 A is bent into a circular loop of radius 10 cm. Determine the magnitude of magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current flow, assuming the wire is infinitely long.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. For a circular loop, the formula for the magnetic field at the center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the current I = 5 A and the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 3.14 × 10⁻⁵ T (tesla)."
