    "message_2": "In a Young's double slit experiment, the interference pattern on the screen is due to the superposition of waves from the two slits. The condition for constructive interference (bright fringes or maxima) is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle of the maximum with respect to the central maximum, m is the order of the maximum (m = 0 for the central maximum, m = 1 for the first maximum, etc.), and λ is the wavelength of the light used.\n\nIn this case, we are given the distance between the slits and the screen (L) as 1.5 meters, the wavelength of light (λ) as 600 nanometers (or 600 * 10^(-9) meters), and the angle of the second-order maximum (m = 2) as 30 degrees. We need to find the distance between the two slits (d).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the formula for constructive interference:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nd * sin(π / 6) = 2 * (600 * 10^(-9) meters)\n\nd * 1/2 = 1200 * 10^(-9) meters\n\nd = 2400 * 10^(-9) meters\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits is 2400 nanometers or 2.4 micrometers."
