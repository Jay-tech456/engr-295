    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures of 500 K and 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency that a heat engine can achieve when operating between two reservoirs at given temperatures. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 500 K.\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nThe Carnot efficiency of the engine is 0.4, or 40%."
