    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is the distance from its center at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. It is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, for a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses:\n\nM = 1,000,000 * M_sun = 1,000,000 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^36 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^36 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.989 x 10^36)) / (8.987 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (2.653 x 10^25) / (8.987 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.953 x 10^8 meters\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses is approximately 2.953 x 10^8 meters.\n\nThe significance of the Schwarzschild radius is that it defines the event horizon of a black hole, which is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The event horizon is often referred to as the \"point of no return.\" Any object or information that crosses the event horizon will be forever trapped inside the black hole. The size of the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that more massive black holes have larger event horizons."
