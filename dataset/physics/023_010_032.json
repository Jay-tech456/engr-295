    "message_2": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factorize large numbers. To implement Shor's algorithm, we need a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits. In this case, we are considering trapped ions as qubits.\n\nTo factorize an n-digit number, we need a quantum computer with at least 2n qubits. This is because Shor's algorithm requires two quantum registers, one for storing the input number and the other for storing the result of the quantum Fourier transform.\n\nFor a 15-digit number, we need at least 2 * 15 = 30 qubits (trapped ions). For a 20-digit number, we need at least 2 * 20 = 40 qubits (trapped ions).\n\nSo, to factorize a 15-digit number using Shor's algorithm, we need a minimum of 30 trapped ions, and for a 20-digit number, we need a minimum of 40 trapped ions."
