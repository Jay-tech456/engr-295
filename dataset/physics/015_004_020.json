    "message_2": "The detectability of gravitational waves from a supernova explosion depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the distance to the supernova. Current gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are sensitive to supernovae within our local group of galaxies (up to around 20 million light-years away). However, the minimum size of a supernova explosion needed to emit detectable gravitational waves is not a well-defined value, as it depends on various factors like the asymmetry of the explosion and the orientation of the supernova with respect to the detectors.\n\nIn general, more massive stars and more energetic explosions are expected to produce stronger gravitational waves. A core-collapse supernova, which occurs when a massive star (at least 8 times the mass of the Sun) exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity, can potentially emit detectable gravitational waves. The energy emitted in gravitational waves depends on the specific details of the explosion, but it is estimated to be a small fraction (around 1% or less) of the total energy released in the supernova, which is typically around 10^44 to 10^46 Joules.\n\nFor a supernova to produce detectable gravitational waves, it needs to have a significant asymmetry in the explosion, as perfectly symmetric explosions would not emit gravitational waves. The more asymmetric the explosion, the stronger the gravitational waves produced. In practice, this means that even relatively small supernovae could potentially produce detectable gravitational waves if the explosion is highly asymmetric.\n\nIn summary, there is no well-defined minimum size for a supernova explosion to emit detectable gravitational waves, as it depends on various factors like the asymmetry of the explosion, the distance to the supernova, and the sensitivity of the detectors. However, more massive stars and more energetic explosions are generally expected to produce stronger gravitational waves, with the energy emitted in gravitational waves being a small fraction of the total energy released in the supernova."
