    "message_2": "To calculate the dielectric constant of the crystal, we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation:\n\n(ε - 1) / (ε + 2) = (4πNα) / 3\n\nwhere ε is the dielectric constant, N is the number of atoms per unit volume, and α is the polarizability of the atoms.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of atoms per unit volume (N). We are given that there are 8 atoms in each unit cell, and the lattice constant is 4 angstroms (4 x 10^-10 m). The volume of the unit cell is:\n\nV = a^3 = (4 x 10^-10 m)^3 = 64 x 10^-30 m^3\n\nNow, we can find the number of atoms per unit volume:\n\nN = 8 atoms / (64 x 10^-30 m^3) = 1.25 x 10^28 atoms/m^3\n\nNow we can plug the values of N and α into the Clausius-Mossotti equation:\n\n(ε - 1) / (ε + 2) = (4π(1.25 x 10^28 atoms/m^3)(2 x 10^-30 Cm^2/V)) / 3\n\n(ε - 1) / (ε + 2) = (4π(2.5 x 10^-2 Cm^2/V)) / 3\n\nNow, we can solve for ε:\n\n(ε - 1) / (ε + 2) = 0.02618\n\nε^2 + ε(2 - 0.02618) - 1 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get two possible values for ε:\n\nε = 0.0131 and ε = -76.0131\n\nSince the dielectric constant cannot be negative, we choose the positive value:\n\nε = 0.0131\n\nTherefore, the dielectric constant of the crystal is approximately 0.0131."
