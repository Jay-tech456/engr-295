    "message_2": "To calculate the boiling point of water at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we need to find the vapor pressure of water at that altitude. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)((1/T2) - (1/T1))\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at sea level and 2000 meters altitude, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T1 and T2 are the boiling points (in Kelvin) at sea level and 2000 meters altitude, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the atmospheric pressure at 2000 meters altitude. We can use the barometric formula for this:\n\nP_altitude = P0 * (1 - (L * h) / T0)^(g * M / (R * L))\n\nwhere P0 is the sea level standard atmospheric pressure (101325 Pa), L is the temperature lapse rate (0.0065 K/m), h is the altitude (2000 m), T0 is the sea level standard temperature (288.15 K), g is the Earth's gravitational acceleration (9.80665 m/s²), M is the molar mass of Earth's air (0.0289644 kg/mol), and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nP_altitude = 101325 * (1 - (0.0065 * 2000) / 288.15)^(9.80665 * 0.0289644 / (8.314 * 0.0065))\nP_altitude ≈ 79432.7 Pa\n\nNow, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the boiling point at 2000 meters altitude. We know that the vapor pressure of water at sea level (P1) is 101325 Pa, and the boiling point at sea level (T1) is 373.15 K (100°C). We also know that the vapor pressure of water at 2000 meters altitude (P2) is equal to the atmospheric pressure at that altitude, which is 79432.7 Pa. The enthalpy of vaporization of water (ΔHvap) is given as 40.7 kJ/mol, which is equal to 40700 J/mol.\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nln(79432.7/101325) = -(40700/8.314)((1/T2) - (1/373.15))\n0.242 = (1/T2) - (1/373.15)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 0.242 + (1/373.15)\nT2 = 1/(0.242 + (1/373.15))\nT2 ≈ 364.15 K\n\nSo, the boiling point of water at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level is approximately 364.15 K, which is equivalent to 91°C."
