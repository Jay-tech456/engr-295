    "message_2": "The current best explanation for the observed accelerating expansion of the universe is the presence of dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a negative pressure, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe was made in the late 1990s through observations of distant Type Ia supernovae, which are used as standard candles to measure cosmic distances.\n\nThe most widely accepted model of dark energy is the cosmological constant (Λ), which was first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. In this model, dark energy is a constant energy density that fills space homogeneously and does not change over time. The cosmological constant is associated with vacuum energy, the energy density of empty space.\n\nThe Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is used to describe the large-scale structure of the universe. The Friedmann equations, derived from the FLRW metric, govern the expansion of the universe. The first Friedmann equation, which relates the expansion rate (Hubble parameter, H) to the energy densities of various components in the universe (matter, radiation, and dark energy), is given by:\n\nH^2 = (8πG/3)(ρ_m + ρ_r + ρ_Λ) - k*c^2/a^2\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, ρ_m, ρ_r, and ρ_Λ are the energy densities of matter, radiation, and dark energy (cosmological constant), respectively, k is the curvature parameter, and a is the scale factor of the universe.\n\nThe second Friedmann equation, which describes the acceleration of the universe, is given by:\n\n(ėa/a) = -4πG/3 * (ρ + 3P)\n\nHere, ėa is the second derivative of the scale factor with respect to time, ρ is the total energy density, and P is the total pressure.\n\nDark energy, represented by the cosmological constant, has a unique equation of state, w = P/ρ, where w = -1. This means that dark energy has a negative pressure, which causes the universe's expansion to accelerate.\n\nObservational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure (LSS), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) support the presence of dark energy. The current cosmological model, known as the ΛCDM model, includes dark energy in the form of the cosmological constant (Λ) and cold dark matter (CDM). This model is consistent with various observational data, including the Planck satellite measurements of the CMB.\n\nAccording to the latest Planck satellite data (2018), the current composition of the universe is approximately 68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter. This supports the idea that dark energy is the dominant component driving the accelerating expansion of the universe."
