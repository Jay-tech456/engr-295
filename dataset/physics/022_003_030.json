    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies is typically modeled as a dark matter halo that surrounds the visible galactic disk. This halo is assumed to be roughly spherical, with the density of dark matter decreasing as we move further away from the center of the galaxy. The most commonly used model for the dark matter halo is the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, which describes the density of dark matter as a function of distance from the galactic center.\n\nThe presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of stars and gas in a galaxy as a function of their distance from the galactic center. In the absence of dark matter, we would expect the rotation curve to follow the Keplerian motion, where the orbital velocity decreases as the distance from the center increases. This is because, in this case, the majority of the mass would be concentrated in the central bulge, and the gravitational force would decrease with distance.\n\nHowever, observations of spiral galaxies show that their rotation curves remain relatively flat or even slightly increasing with distance from the center, which is inconsistent with the Keplerian motion. This discrepancy is known as the \"rotation curve problem\" and is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nThe dark matter halo provides an additional gravitational force that prevents the orbital velocities from decreasing as rapidly as they would in the absence of dark matter. The flat rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies can be explained by the combined gravitational effects of both the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) and the dark matter halo. The distribution of dark matter in the halo plays a crucial role in shaping the rotation curves and the overall dynamics of spiral galaxies."
