    "message_2": "The estimated mass range of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have been proposed as a possible composition of dark matter varies widely, from as small as 10^-18 solar masses (M☉) to several tens of solar masses. Some models even suggest PBHs could have masses up to 10^5 M☉. However, certain mass ranges have been constrained or ruled out by various observations and experiments.\n\nThere are several methods to detect primordial black holes experimentally:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: PBHs can act as gravitational lenses, bending the light from distant stars or galaxies. Microlensing surveys, such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and the Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHO) project, can be used to search for PBHs in the lower mass range (around 10^-7 to 1 M☉).\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: PBHs with masses around 10^-14 to 10^-9 M☉ could have affected the CMB radiation by altering the ionization history of the universe. Observations of the CMB, such as those made by the Planck satellite, can be used to constrain the abundance of PBHs in this mass range.\n\n3. Gravitational waves: The merger of PBHs can produce gravitational waves, which can be detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. This method is particularly sensitive to PBHs with masses in the range of a few to several tens of solar masses.\n\n4. Gamma-ray and X-ray background: PBHs with masses around 10^14 to 10^15 grams (about 10^-18 to 10^-17 M☉) are expected to evaporate through Hawking radiation, producing gamma-rays and X-rays. Observations of the gamma-ray and X-ray background can be used to constrain the abundance of PBHs in this mass range.\n\n5. Dynamical effects on astrophysical systems: PBHs can have dynamical effects on the motion of stars in globular clusters, the orbits of wide binary stars, or the distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies. Observations of these systems can be used to constrain the abundance of PBHs with masses in the range of 10^-8 to 10^2 M☉.\n\nIn summary, the mass range of primordial black holes proposed as a possible composition of dark matter is quite broad, and various experimental methods can be used to detect or constrain their abundance in different mass ranges."
