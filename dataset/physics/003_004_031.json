    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point above the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance above the center of the loop.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 0.1 A\nR = 0.05 m\nx = 0.1 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.1 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.1 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 0.1 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB = (π × 10^(-7) * 0.1 * 0.0025) / (0.0125^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 2.00 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.1 m above the center of the loop is approximately 2.00 × 10^(-8) Tesla."
