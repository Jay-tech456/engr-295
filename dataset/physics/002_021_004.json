    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of methane gas using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, we need to first determine the compressibility factor (Z) and the molar volume (V) of the gas. The problem statement already provides us with these values: Z = 0.915 and V = 0.0235 m³/mol.\n\nNext, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ) using the following equation:\n\nφ = exp[(Z - 1) - ln(Z - B) - (A / (2 * sqrt(2) * B)) * ln((Z + (1 + sqrt(2)) * B) / (Z + (1 - sqrt(2)) * B))]\n\nWhere A and B are the Peng-Robinson equation of state parameters, which can be calculated using the critical properties of methane and the reduced pressure and temperature.\n\nFor methane, the critical properties are:\nTc = 190.56 K (critical temperature)\nPc = 45.99 atm (critical pressure)\nω = 0.012 (acentric factor)\n\nGiven temperature T = 25°C = 298.15 K and pressure P = 2 atm, we can calculate the reduced temperature (Tr) and reduced pressure (Pr) as follows:\n\nTr = T / Tc = 298.15 / 190.56 = 1.565\nPr = P / Pc = 2 / 45.99 = 0.0435\n\nNow, we can calculate the Peng-Robinson equation of state parameters A and B using the following equations:\n\nα = (1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 * ω - 0.26992 * ω^2) * (1 - sqrt(Tr)))^2\nA = 0.45724 * (R^2 * Tc^2) / Pc * α\nB = 0.07780 * (R * Tc) / Pc\n\nWhere R is the universal gas constant, R = 0.08206 L atm / (K mol).\n\nCalculating α, A, and B:\n\nα = (1 + (0.37464 + 1.54226 * 0.012 - 0.26992 * 0.012^2) * (1 - sqrt(1.565)))^2 = 1.202\nA = 0.45724 * (0.08206^2 * 190.56^2) / 45.99 * 1.202 = 0.00171 atm * m^6 / mol^2\nB = 0.07780 * (0.08206 * 190.56) / 45.99 = 0.00066 m³/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity coefficient (φ):\n\nφ = exp[(0.915 - 1) - ln(0.915 - 0.00066) - (0.00171 / (2 * sqrt(2) * 0.00066)) * ln((0.915 + (1 + sqrt(2)) * 0.00066) / (0.915 + (1 - sqrt(2)) * 0.00066))]\nφ = exp[-0.085 - ln(0.91434) - (0.00171 / (2 * sqrt(2) * 0.00066)) * ln(0.91732 / 0.91236)]\nφ = exp[-0.085 - (-0.091) - 0.00097 * ln(1.00544)]\nφ = exp[0.006 - 0.00097 * 0.00544]\nφ = exp[0.005]\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity (f) using the following equation:\n\nf = φ * P = exp(0.005) * 2 atm = 2.010 atm\n\nTherefore, the fugacity of methane gas at 25°C and 2 atm pressure using the Peng-Robinson equation of state is approximately 2.010 atm."
