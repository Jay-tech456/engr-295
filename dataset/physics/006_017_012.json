    "message_2": "To find the value of the magnetic field required to observe resonance in a sample of lithium atoms with an electron spin of 1/2, we can use the formula for the Larmor frequency, which relates the resonance frequency to the magnetic field strength and the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle:\n\nf = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere f is the resonance frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, B is the magnetic field strength, and π is the constant pi.\n\nFor an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is approximately 2.8 * 10^10 rad/(T*s). Given a resonance frequency (f) of 256 GHz, we can convert this to Hz by multiplying by 10^9:\n\nf = 256 * 10^9 Hz\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to solve for the magnetic field strength (B):\n\nB = (2 * π * f) / γ\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (2 * π * 256 * 10^9 Hz) / (2.8 * 10^10 rad/(T*s))\n\nB ≈ 5.72 T\n\nTherefore, the value of the magnetic field required to observe resonance in a sample of lithium atoms with an electron spin of 1/2, given a resonance frequency of 256 GHz, is approximately 5.72 Tesla."
