    "message_2": "To calculate the redshift experienced by light emitted from the surface of a planet, we need to use the gravitational redshift formula. The formula for gravitational redshift is given by:\n\nΔν/ν = Δλ/λ = GM/c²R\n\nwhere Δν is the change in frequency (Hz), ν is the initial frequency (Hz), Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the planet (kg), c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s), and R is the radius of the planet (m).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given radius of the planet from kilometers to meters:\n\nR = 8000 km * 1000 m/km = 8,000,000 m\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the planet. Since the planet has twice the mass of Earth, we can calculate its mass as follows:\n\nM = 2 * M_earth = 2 * 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg = 1.1944 × 10²⁵ kg\n\nNow we can plug these values into the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔν/ν = GM/c²R = (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.1944 × 10²⁵ kg) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)² * 8,000,000 m\n\nΔν/ν = (7.964 × 10¹⁴ m²/s²) / (8.987 × 10¹⁶ m²/s²)\n\nΔν/ν ≈ 0.0000886\n\nTo find the redshift in Hz, we need to know the initial frequency (ν) of the light. However, since the problem does not provide this information, we cannot calculate the redshift in Hz. Instead, we can express the redshift as a dimensionless quantity (Δν/ν ≈ 0.0000886), which represents the fractional change in frequency due to the planet's gravity."
