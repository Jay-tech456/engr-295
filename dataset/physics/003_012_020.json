    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point along the central axis of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the problem, we can simplify the calculation by considering only one pair of opposite sides of the loop and then doubling the result.\n\nLet's consider the two long sides of the loop (40 cm each). We can break down the magnetic field produced by each side into two components: one parallel to the central axis and one perpendicular to it. Due to symmetry, the perpendicular components will cancel each other out, and we only need to consider the parallel components.\n\nFor a straight wire carrying current I, the magnetic field at a point P located at a perpendicular distance R from the wire and at an angle θ1 to θ2 with respect to the wire ends is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4πR) * (sinθ₂ - sinθ₁)\n\nFor the two long sides of the loop, the distance R is 10 cm, and the angles θ1 and θ2 are -45° and 45°, respectively. The current I is 3 A, and the permeability of free space μ₀ is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB_long = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A / 4π * 0.1 m) * (sin(45°) - sin(-45°))\nB_long = (3 × 10^(-7) Tm * (0.7071 + 0.7071))\nB_long = 4.242 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by the two short sides of the loop (20 cm each). The distance R is now the diagonal of the rectangle, which is √(10² + 20²) cm = √500 cm. The angles θ1 and θ2 are 0° and 90°, respectively.\n\nB_short = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A / 4π * √500 × 10^(-2) m) * (sin(90°) - sin(0°))\nB_short = (3 × 10^(-7) Tm / √500) * 1\nB_short = 4.242 × 10^(-8) T\n\nNow, we can add the magnetic fields produced by the long and short sides of the loop:\n\nB_total = 2 * (B_long + B_short)\nB_total = 2 * (4.242 × 10^(-7) T + 4.242 × 10^(-8) T)\nB_total = 8.484 × 10^(-7) T + 8.484 × 10^(-8) T\nB_total ≈ 9.332 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the loop along the central axis of the loop is approximately 9.332 × 10^(-7) T."
