    "message_2": "The optimal gas pressure and temperature for plasma-based processing of strawberries to achieve a 99% reduction of microbial contamination while preserving the fruit's quality can vary depending on the specific plasma system used and the type of gas employed. However, some general guidelines can be provided based on existing research.\n\nCold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) has been shown to be effective in reducing microbial contamination on strawberries while preserving their quality. A study by Misra et al. (2011) found that using a helium-based CAPP system at a gas flow rate of 5 L/min and a treatment time of 5 minutes resulted in a significant reduction of microbial contamination without affecting the fruit's quality.\n\nAnother study by Xiang et al. (2018) used a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma system with a mixture of air and nitrogen gas. They found that a gas pressure of 1 atm (atmospheric pressure), a temperature of 25°C, and a treatment time of 10 minutes resulted in a 99% reduction of microbial contamination on strawberries without affecting their quality.\n\nIn summary, the optimal gas pressure and temperature for plasma-based processing of strawberries to achieve a 99% reduction of microbial contamination while preserving the fruit's quality would be around atmospheric pressure (1 atm) and room temperature (25°C). The specific gas flow rate, treatment time, and type of plasma system used may vary depending on the desired outcome and available equipment."
