    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system depend on the masses of the black holes, their orbital separation, and the inclination angle of the system relative to the observer. In general, the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves will be different for systems with unequal masses compared to those with equal masses.\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the system and inversely proportional to the distance from the observer. For a binary black hole system with unequal masses (M1 and M2), the amplitude will be smaller than that of a system with equal masses (M1 = M2), assuming the same distance from the observer. This is because the total mass of the system (M1 + M2) and the reduced mass (M1 * M2 / (M1 + M2)) will be smaller for the unequal mass system, leading to a smaller amplitude.\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of gravitational waves is determined by the orbital frequency of the binary black hole system. For a system with unequal masses, the orbital frequency will be different from that of a system with equal masses. The orbital frequency depends on the total mass of the system (M1 + M2) and the reduced mass (M1 * M2 / (M1 + M2)). In general, the orbital frequency will be higher for a system with unequal masses compared to a system with equal masses, assuming the same orbital separation.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses will generally be smaller, and the frequency will be higher compared to a system with equal masses. The exact values will depend on the specific masses of the black holes, their orbital separation, and the inclination angle of the system relative to the observer."
