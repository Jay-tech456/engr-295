    "message_1": "A spaceship travels through space with a speed of 0.8c (80% of the speed of light) relative to Earth. The spaceship is equipped with a clock that measures time in its own reference frame. How much time will have passed on the spaceship's clock when it reaches a planet 10 light-years away, according to an observer on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the moving object (the spaceship), Δt is the time experienced by the stationary observer (on Earth), v is the relative velocity of the moving object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for the spaceship to travel 10 light-years according to the observer on Earth. Since the spaceship is traveling at 0.8c, we can calculate the time as follows:\n\nΔt = distance / speed = 10 light-years / 0.8c = 12.5 years\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation equation to find the time experienced by the spaceship:\n\nΔt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 12.5 years / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = 12.5 years / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 12.5 years / sqrt(0.36)\n\nΔt' = 12.5 years / 0.6 = 20.83 years\n\nSo, according to the spaceship's clock, 20.83 years will have passed when it reaches the planet 10 light-years away, as observed by someone on Earth."
