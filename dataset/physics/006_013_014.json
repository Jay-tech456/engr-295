    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier, we can use the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation and the concept of transmission coefficient. The transmission coefficient (T) represents the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular potential barrier of height V₀ and width L, the transmission coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V₀² * sinh²(kL) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E))))\n\nwhere:\n- E is the energy of the electron\n- V₀ is the height of the potential barrier\n- L is the thickness (width) of the barrier\n- k is the wave vector inside the barrier, given by k = sqrt(2 * m * (V₀ - E) / ħ²)\n- m is the mass of the electron\n- ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π)\n\nGiven the energy level (E) and the thickness of the barrier (L), you can calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through the potential barrier using the above formula. Note that this is a simplified model and may not be applicable to all situations, especially when dealing with complex atomic systems."
