    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the current flowing through the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by the Biot-Savart Law. The formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nWe are given B = 0.02 T and r = 5 cm = 0.05 m. We need to find the current I.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for I:\n\nI = (B * 2 * π * r) / μ₀\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nI = (0.02 T * 2 * π * 0.05 m) / (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n\nI ≈ (0.02 * 2 * π * 0.05) / (4π × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ 0.001 / (4 × 10^(-7))\n\nI ≈ 2500 A\n\nSo, the magnitude of the current flowing through the wire is approximately 2500 Amperes."
