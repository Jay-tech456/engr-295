    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced at a point located 2 cm from the center of the transformer, we need to find the magnetic field produced by both the primary and secondary coils and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil. We can use Ampere's Law to calculate the magnetic field around a solenoid (coil). The formula for the magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the coil.\n\nFor the primary coil, we have:\nNumber of turns (N1) = 200 turns\nCurrent (I1) = 5 A\n\nWe need to find the number of turns per unit length (n1) for the primary coil. Since we don't have information about the length of the coil, we can assume that the magnetic field is uniform inside the solenoid and that the distance from the center of the transformer (2 cm) is within the solenoid. In this case, we can use the total number of turns (N1) as an approximation for the number of turns per unit length (n1).\n\nn1 ≈ N1 = 200 turns\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field produced by the primary coil (B1):\n\nB1 = μ₀ * n1 * I1\nB1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (200 turns) * (5 A)\nB1 ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-3) T\n\nNext, we need to find the magnetic field produced by the secondary coil. We can use the same formula, but first, we need to find the current flowing through the secondary coil (I2). We can use the transformer equation to find the secondary current:\n\nN1 * I1 = N2 * I2\n\nwhere N1 and I1 are the number of turns and current in the primary coil, and N2 and I2 are the number of turns and current in the secondary coil.\n\nFor the secondary coil, we have:\nNumber of turns (N2) = 800 turns\n\nNow we can find the secondary current (I2):\n\nI2 = (N1 * I1) / N2\nI2 = (200 turns * 5 A) / (800 turns)\nI2 = 1.25 A\n\nNow we can find the number of turns per unit length (n2) for the secondary coil, using the same assumption as for the primary coil:\n\nn2 ≈ N2 = 800 turns\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field produced by the secondary coil (B2):\n\nB2 = μ₀ * n2 * I2\nB2 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (800 turns) * (1.25 A)\nB2 ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-3) T\n\nFinally, we can find the total magnetic field (B_total) at the point located 2 cm from the center of the transformer by adding the magnetic fields produced by the primary and secondary coils:\n\nB_total = B1 + B2\nB_total ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-3) T + 1.26 × 10^(-3) T\nB_total ≈ 2.52 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced at a point located 2 cm from the center of the transformer is approximately 2.52 × 10^(-3) T."
