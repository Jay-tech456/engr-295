    "message_1": "A typical nuclear power plant has an overall thermal efficiency of approximately 33%. If a particular plant produces electricity at a rate of 1.2 GW, how much thermal power must the plant generate?",
    "message_2": "To find the thermal power generated by the plant, we can use the formula:\n\nThermal power = Electrical power / Efficiency\n\nIn this case, the electrical power is 1.2 GW and the efficiency is 33% (0.33 as a decimal).\n\nThermal power = 1.2 GW / 0.33\n\nThermal power â‰ˆ 3.64 GW\n\nSo, the plant must generate approximately 3.64 GW of thermal power."
