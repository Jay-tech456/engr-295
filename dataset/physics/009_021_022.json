    "message_1": "What is the angle of reflection for polarized light of incident angle 45 degrees that is reflected off a smooth surface with a refractive index of 1.5?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of reflection for polarized light, we can use Snell's Law and the Fresnel equations. However, since the question asks for the angle of reflection, we can simply use the Law of Reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. \n\nIn this case, the incident angle is 45 degrees, so the angle of reflection will also be 45 degrees. This holds true regardless of the refractive index of the material or the polarization state of the light."
