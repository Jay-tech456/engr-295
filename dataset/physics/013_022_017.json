    "message_2": "The mechanism behind the rapid growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies is primarily through the accretion of mass. This process involves the black hole attracting and consuming nearby gas, dust, and stellar material, which in turn increases its mass and size. There are several factors that contribute to this rapid growth:\n\n1. Gas and dust inflow: The central regions of galaxies often contain large amounts of gas and dust. The gravitational pull of the SMBH attracts this material, which forms an accretion disk around the black hole. As the material in the disk spirals inward, it heats up and emits radiation, eventually being consumed by the black hole.\n\n2. Galaxy mergers: When two galaxies collide, their central black holes can merge, forming a more massive black hole. This process can also trigger a burst of star formation, providing more fuel for the SMBH to consume.\n\n3. Tidal disruption events: Occasionally, a star will pass too close to a SMBH and be torn apart by the black hole's tidal forces. The debris from the disrupted star can then be accreted by the black hole, contributing to its growth.\n\nThe evolution of SMBHs over time can have significant effects on the overall structure and movement of their host galaxies:\n\n1. Regulation of star formation: The radiation and outflows from the accretion process around SMBHs can heat up and disperse the surrounding gas, making it more difficult for new stars to form. This can help regulate the overall rate of star formation in the galaxy.\n\n2. Galactic winds and outflows: The energy released by the accretion process can also drive powerful winds and outflows that can eject gas and dust from the galaxy. This can affect the overall distribution of mass within the galaxy and potentially influence its future evolution.\n\n3. Gravitational influence: The presence of a massive SMBH at the center of a galaxy can have a significant impact on the orbits of stars and other objects within the galaxy. This can lead to the formation of structures like galactic bulges and influence the overall shape and dynamics of the galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the rapid growth of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies is primarily driven by the accretion of mass from their surroundings. Their evolution over time can have significant effects on the overall structure, movement, and star formation within their host galaxies."
