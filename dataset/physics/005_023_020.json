    "message_1": "Consider a spacecraft falling radially towards a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole with a total mass M. At some point outside of the event horizon, the spacecraft releases a small object in the radial direction with speed v. How close to the black hole will the object get before being swallowed? Calculate this distance in terms of the Schwarzschild radius Rs (i.e., GM/c^2).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of energy conservation and the effective potential for a test particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The energy conservation equation for a test particle in Schwarzschild spacetime is given by:\n\nE = (1 - Rs/r) * (1 + v^2/c^2)^0.5\n\nwhere E is the conserved energy of the test particle, Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, r is the radial coordinate, v is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light. The effective potential for a test particle in Schwarzschild spacetime is given by:\n\nV_eff(r) = (1 - Rs/r) * (1 + L^2/(r^2*c^2))\n\nwhere L is the conserved angular momentum of the test particle. Since the object is released radially, L = 0. Therefore, the effective potential simplifies to:\n\nV_eff(r) = 1 - Rs/r\n\nAt the turning point, the kinetic energy of the test particle is zero, and the conserved energy E equals the effective potential V_eff(r). Thus, we have:\n\nE = 1 - Rs/r_turn\n\nwhere r_turn is the radial coordinate of the turning point. Now, we can equate the two expressions for E:\n\n(1 - Rs/r) * (1 + v^2/c^2)^0.5 = 1 - Rs/r_turn\n\nWe want to find r_turn in terms of Rs. To do this, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nRs/r_turn - Rs/r = (v^2/c^2)^0.5 * (1 - Rs/r)\n\nNow, let's introduce a dimensionless parameter x = r/Rs and x_turn = r_turn/Rs. The equation becomes:\n\n1/x_turn - 1/x = (v^2/c^2)^0.5 * (1 - 1/x)\n\nWe can solve for x_turn:\n\nx_turn = 1 / (1/x - (v^2/c^2)^0.5 * (1 - 1/x))\n\nThis equation gives the distance of the turning point (closest approach) in terms of the Schwarzschild radius Rs and the initial radial velocity v. Note that the actual distance r_turn is given by r_turn = x_turn * Rs."
