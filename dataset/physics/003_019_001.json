    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a radius of 2 cm from the center of a coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction, and its magnitude is constant along a circle of radius r. Therefore, we can simplify the line integral as follows:\n\nB∮dl = B(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop at a radius of 2 cm. Since the inner radius of the cable is 1 cm and the outer radius is 3 cm, the current is only flowing in the region between these two radii. The current is uniformly distributed over this region, so the current enclosed by a loop of radius 2 cm is half of the total current:\n\nI_enclosed = (1/2) * 10 A = 5 A\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I_enclosed\nB(2π(0.02 m)) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 5 A\nB(0.04π) = 20π × 10^(-7) T\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.04\nB = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a radius of 2 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is 5 μT.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current flow (from the inner radius to the outer radius), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction, which is tangential to the circle of radius 2 cm."
