    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 2 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 2 A and r = 4 cm = 0.04 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.08 m)\n\nB = 10^(-7) * 100π T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have information about the orientation of the wire, we can only say that the magnetic field will be in a circular pattern around the wire, perpendicular to the wire's direction."
