    "message_2": "Plasma-based models, also known as plasma cosmology, attempt to explain the large-scale structures and motions in the universe by considering the behavior of plasma, which is an ionized gas consisting of charged particles like electrons and ions. Plasma is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, making up stars, interstellar and intergalactic medium, and other astrophysical phenomena.\n\nOne of the key concepts in plasma cosmology is the role of electromagnetic forces, which are much stronger than gravitational forces, in shaping the large-scale structures of the universe. Here are some ways plasma-based models can explain the observed cosmic filaments and galactic superclusters:\n\n1. Cosmic filaments: Plasma cosmology suggests that cosmic filaments, which are the largest known structures in the universe, are formed due to the interaction of plasma with magnetic fields. These interactions can create large-scale electric currents, known as Birkeland currents, which can generate magnetic fields that can span across vast distances in space. These magnetic fields can then cause the plasma to self-organize into filamentary structures, which can attract and confine neutral matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters along these filaments.\n\n2. Galactic superclusters: In plasma cosmology, the formation of galactic superclusters can be explained by the interaction of large-scale Birkeland currents and the associated magnetic fields. These currents can create regions of higher density plasma, which can attract and confine neutral matter, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The alignment of these structures into superclusters can be attributed to the large-scale organization of the plasma and the magnetic fields that guide their motion.\n\n3. Large-scale motions: Plasma-based models can also explain the observed large-scale motions of galaxies and galaxy clusters by considering the role of electromagnetic forces in addition to gravity. The motion of charged particles in the plasma can generate electric and magnetic fields, which can influence the motion of other charged particles and neutral matter. This can lead to large-scale coherent motions, such as the rotation of galaxies and the streaming motion of galaxy clusters, which are difficult to explain using only gravitational forces.\n\nIt is important to note that plasma cosmology is not widely accepted by the mainstream scientific community, as it faces several challenges in explaining various observational data, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale distribution of galaxies. The current standard model of cosmology, known as the Lambda-CDM model, which includes dark matter and dark energy, has been more successful in explaining these observations. However, plasma-based models can still provide valuable insights into the role of plasma and electromagnetic forces in shaping the large-scale structures and motions in the universe."
