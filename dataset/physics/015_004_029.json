    "message_2": "The energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion is typically a small fraction of the total energy released. It is estimated that around 1% or less of the total energy is emitted in gravitational waves. \n\nAssuming the explosion releases 10^44 Joules of energy in all directions, the order of magnitude of the energy emitted in gravitational waves would be:\n\n(10^44 Joules) * (0.01) â‰ˆ 10^42 Joules\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion is approximately 10^42 Joules."
