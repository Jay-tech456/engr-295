    "message_2": "The final fate of a star with an initial mass of 20 times that of our Sun, after it has exhausted all its nuclear fuel and undergone gravitational collapse, is that it will explode in a supernova and then become a black hole. Stars with masses greater than around 3 times the mass of our Sun are expected to end their lives as black holes.\n\nTo calculate the critical radius, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), necessary for the star to become a black hole, we can use the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star into kilograms. The mass of our Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so a star with 20 times the mass of our Sun would have a mass of:\n\nM = 20 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (3.978 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 1.179 x 10^11 m\n\nSo the critical radius, or Schwarzschild radius, necessary for the star to become a black hole is approximately 1.179 x 10^11 meters."
