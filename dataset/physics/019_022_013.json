    "message_2": "The holographic duality, also known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, is a conjectured relationship between a 3+1 dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) and a 4+1 dimensional gravity theory. The duality states that a strongly coupled QFT can be described by a weakly coupled gravity theory in one higher dimension, and vice versa. This correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997 and has since become a central topic in theoretical physics.\n\nTo calculate the holographic duality using quantum field theory techniques, one needs to follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify the QFT and gravity theory: The first step is to identify the specific QFT and gravity theory that are conjectured to be dual to each other. The most well-known example is the duality between N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (a 3+1 dimensional QFT) and Type IIB supergravity on AdS_5 x S^5 (a 4+1 dimensional gravity theory).\n\n2. Calculate correlation functions: In the QFT, one can calculate correlation functions of local operators using standard quantum field theory techniques, such as perturbation theory, lattice methods, or other non-perturbative approaches. These correlation functions encode the physical observables of the QFT.\n\n3. Map the QFT observables to the gravity side: The holographic duality provides a dictionary that relates the QFT observables to quantities in the gravity theory. For example, the correlation functions of local operators in the QFT can be mapped to the expectation values of certain fields in the gravity theory.\n\n4. Calculate the gravity observables: On the gravity side, one can use classical or semi-classical techniques to calculate the observables that correspond to the QFT correlation functions. This typically involves solving the classical equations of motion for the fields in the gravity theory, possibly with certain boundary conditions that correspond to the QFT operators.\n\n5. Compare the results: Finally, one can compare the results obtained from the QFT and gravity calculations. If the holographic duality is correct, the two sets of results should agree, at least in certain limits (e.g., when the QFT is strongly coupled and the gravity theory is weakly coupled).\n\nIt is important to note that the holographic duality is still a conjecture, and there is no rigorous proof of its validity. However, numerous examples and tests have provided strong evidence for the correspondence, and it has led to many insights in both quantum field theory and gravity."
