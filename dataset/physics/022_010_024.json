    "message_2": "Dark matter has a significant effect on cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and plays a crucial role in our understanding of the early universe. The CMB is the relic radiation from the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only about 380,000 years old. At that time, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of photons, electrons, and protons, along with dark matter particles.\n\nDark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content, does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. However, it does interact gravitationally, and this interaction has a noticeable impact on the CMB. Here are some ways dark matter affects the CMB and our understanding of the early universe:\n\n1. Structure formation: Dark matter serves as the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The distribution of dark matter in the early universe influenced the distribution of the CMB temperature fluctuations, which are the seeds of these structures. By studying the CMB, we can learn about the distribution and properties of dark matter and how it contributed to the formation of the cosmic structures we observe today.\n\n2. Acoustic oscillations: The early universe was filled with a tightly coupled plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons (protons and neutrons). This plasma experienced pressure-driven oscillations, known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Dark matter, being non-relativistic and non-interacting with photons, provided additional gravitational potential wells that enhanced the BAO. The imprint of these oscillations is visible in the CMB as a series of peaks and troughs in the temperature power spectrum. By analyzing these peaks, we can infer the relative amounts of dark matter, baryonic matter, and radiation in the early universe.\n\n3. Lensing effect: As CMB photons travel through the universe, their paths are bent by the gravitational influence of massive structures, including dark matter. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, distorts the CMB temperature and polarization patterns. By studying these distortions, we can map the distribution of dark matter and better understand its properties and role in the evolution of the universe.\n\nIn summary, dark matter has a significant impact on the cosmic microwave background radiation, influencing the formation of large-scale structures, enhancing baryon acoustic oscillations, and causing gravitational lensing effects. Studying the CMB allows us to probe the properties and distribution of dark matter, which is crucial for understanding the early universe's evolution and the formation of the cosmic structures we observe today."
