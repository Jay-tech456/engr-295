    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given the total number of turns (200) and the length of the solenoid (50 cm or 0.5 m). So,\n\nn = (total number of turns) / (length of solenoid)\nn = 200 / 0.5 m\nn = 400 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (400 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ Tm/A) * (800 A/m)\nB ≈ 1.0053 × 10⁻³ T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid is approximately 1.0053 × 10⁻³ T (tesla)."
