    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released when dark matter particles with a mass of 10 GeV annihilate with their anti-particles, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass from GeV (giga-electron volts) to kg. The conversion factor is 1 GeV = 1.7827 x 10^-36 kg. So, the mass of one dark matter particle in kg is:\n\n10 GeV * (1.7827 x 10^-36 kg/GeV) = 1.7827 x 10^-35 kg\n\nSince both the dark matter particle and its anti-particle have the same mass, the total mass involved in the annihilation is:\n\n2 * (1.7827 x 10^-35 kg) = 3.5654 x 10^-35 kg\n\nNow, we can use E=mc^2 to calculate the energy released. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = (3.5654 x 10^-35 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.2089 x 10^-10 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released when a 10 GeV dark matter particle annihilates with its anti-particle is approximately 3.2089 x 10^-10 Joules."
