    "message_2": "When the container is tilted at an angle of 30 degrees, the water will redistribute itself within the container, and the water at the bottom of the container will experience an acceleration due to gravity acting along the tilted surface. \n\nTo find the acceleration of the water at the bottom of the container, we can consider the component of gravitational acceleration acting along the tilted surface. The gravitational acceleration (g) is 9.81 m/s². \n\nThe angle between the gravitational force and the tilted surface is 30 degrees. Therefore, the component of gravitational acceleration acting along the tilted surface can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na = g * sin(θ)\n\nwhere a is the acceleration of the water at the bottom of the container, g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²), and θ is the angle between the gravitational force and the tilted surface (30 degrees).\n\na = 9.81 m/s² * sin(30°)\na = 9.81 m/s² * 0.5\na = 4.905 m/s²\n\nSo, the acceleration of the water at the bottom of the container is 4.905 m/s²."
