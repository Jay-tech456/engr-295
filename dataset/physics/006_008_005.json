    "message_1": "A sodium atom has a work function of 2.28 eV. If a photon with a frequency of 5.0 x 10^14 Hz is incident on the atom, calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident photon (5.0 x 10^14 Hz), and W is the work function of the sodium atom (2.28 eV).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the work function from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So,\n\nW (J) = 2.28 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.6536 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (5.0 x 10^14 Hz) - 3.6536 x 10^-19 J\nK_max = 3.313 x 10^-19 J - 3.6536 x 10^-19 J\nK_max = -3.406 x 10^-20 J\n\nSince the kinetic energy cannot be negative, there is no photoelectron emission in this case. The incident photon does not have enough energy to overcome the work function of the sodium atom."
