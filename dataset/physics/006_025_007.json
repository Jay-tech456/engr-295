    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the nuclear fission process, we can use the mass-energy equivalence formula, which is given by:\n\nE = Δm * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the mass difference between the initial and final products, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is:\n\n1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the mass difference in kg is:\n\nΔm = 0.24 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 3.9853 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released using the mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = (3.9853 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.9853 x 10^-28 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 35.8677 x 10^-12 kg * m^2/s^2\nE = 35.8677 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released in the nuclear fission process of a Uranium-235 nucleus that splits into two fragments with mass numbers 96 and 139 is approximately 35.87 x 10^-12 Joules."
