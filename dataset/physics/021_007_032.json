    "message_2": "When a planet gets too close to a black hole, its orbit and motion can be significantly affected due to the immense gravitational pull of the black hole. There are a few possible outcomes depending on the initial conditions and the distance between the planet and the black hole.\n\n1. Gravitational slingshot: If the planet approaches the black hole but does not get too close, it can experience a gravitational slingshot effect. This is when the planet's path is bent by the black hole's gravity, causing it to accelerate and be flung away at a higher velocity. This can result in the planet being ejected from its original star system or having its orbit significantly altered.\n\n2. Stable orbit: In some cases, a planet may end up in a stable orbit around the black hole, similar to how planets orbit stars. However, this is only possible if the planet is outside the black hole's event horizon and is not too close to the black hole, where tidal forces would become too strong.\n\n3. Tidal disruption: If the planet gets too close to the black hole, the tidal forces exerted by the black hole can become so strong that they can tear the planet apart. This occurs when the gravitational pull on the side of the planet closest to the black hole is significantly stronger than the pull on the far side, causing the planet to stretch and eventually disintegrate.\n\n4. Event horizon crossing: If the planet gets even closer and crosses the event horizon of the black hole, it will be irreversibly pulled into the black hole and will not be able to escape due to the immense gravity. At this point, the planet's information and mass will be added to the black hole, and it will cease to exist as a separate entity.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between a planet and a black hole can have various effects on the planet's motion, ranging from gravitational slingshots to complete destruction or absorption by the black hole. The specific outcome depends on the initial conditions and the distance between the planet and the black hole."
