The heat of formation for methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water are -75.0, 0, -393.5, and -241.8 kJ/mol, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔHf is the heat of formation.\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change can be calculated as follows:\n\nΔH = [2 moles CO2 × ΔHf(CO2) + 4 moles H2O × ΔHf(H2O)] - [2 moles CH4 × ΔHf(CH4) + 4 moles O2 × ΔHf(O2)]\n\nΔH = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 4 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (-75.0 kJ/mol) + 4 × (0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [-787 kJ + (-967.2 kJ)] - [-150 kJ]\n\nΔH = -1754.2 kJ + 150 kJ\n\nΔH = -1604.2 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -1604.2 kJ."
