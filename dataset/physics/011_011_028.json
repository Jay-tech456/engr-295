    "message_2": "The piezoelectric coefficient of a quartz crystal, denoted as d, is a measure of the material's ability to convert mechanical stress into electrical charge or vice versa. The piezoelectric coefficient depends on the crystal orientation and temperature.\n\nFor quartz, the most commonly used piezoelectric coefficients are d11, d14, and d36. The values of these coefficients at room temperature (20°C) are as follows:\n\n- d11 ≈ 2.3 pC/N\n- d14 ≈ -0.67 pC/N\n- d36 ≈ 0.5 pC/N\n\nThe piezoelectric coefficients of quartz vary with temperature. The temperature dependence of the piezoelectric coefficients can be described by the following empirical equation:\n\nd(T) = d(0) * (1 - α * (T - T0))\n\nwhere:\n- d(T) is the piezoelectric coefficient at temperature T\n- d(0) is the piezoelectric coefficient at reference temperature T0 (usually room temperature)\n- α is the temperature coefficient of the piezoelectric coefficient\n- T is the temperature of interest\n- T0 is the reference temperature\n\nThe temperature coefficients (α) for quartz are approximately:\n\n- α11 ≈ -0.00007 /°C\n- α14 ≈ -0.00009 /°C\n- α36 ≈ -0.00005 /°C\n\nTo find the piezoelectric coefficient at a certain temperature, you can use the empirical equation mentioned above. Keep in mind that these values are approximate, and the actual values may vary depending on the specific quartz crystal and its impurities."
