    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram and determine the position, size, and orientation of the image formed by the concave mirror, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis of the mirror.\n2. Draw a vertical line at the center of the mirror to represent the mirror's pole (P).\n3. Mark the focal point (F) on the principal axis at a distance of 10 cm to the left of the pole (since the focal length is -10 cm).\n4. Draw a vertical line representing the object (AB) at a distance of 20 cm to the left of the pole.\n5. Draw three rays from the top of the object (A) to the mirror:\n\n   a. Ray 1: Draw a parallel line to the principal axis from point A to the mirror. After reflecting, this ray will pass through the focal point (F).\n   b. Ray 2: Draw a line from point A to the focal point (F). After reflecting, this ray will be parallel to the principal axis.\n   c. Ray 3: Draw a line from point A to the pole (P). After reflecting, this ray will follow the same path but in the opposite direction (since the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection).\n\n6. The point where the reflected rays intersect is the position of the image (A'). Draw a vertical line from this point to the principal axis to represent the image (A'B').\n7. Measure the distance between the image (A'B') and the mirror's pole (P) to find the image distance (di).\n\nUsing the mirror formula, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance:\n\n1/-10 = 1/20 + 1/di\n-1/10 = 1/20 + 1/di\n1/di = -1/10 - 1/20\n1/di = -3/20\ndi = -20/3 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is -20/3 cm, which means the image is formed 20/3 cm to the left of the mirror's pole (P). Since the image distance is negative, the image is virtual, erect, and on the same side as the object.\n\nTo find the size and orientation of the image, use the magnification formula, M = -di/do:\n\nM = -(-20/3)/20\nM = (20/3)/20\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification is 1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object and has the same orientation (erect). The image (A'B') will be smaller and upright compared to the object (AB).\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave mirror is virtual, erect, and on the same side as the object, with a distance of 20/3 cm from the mirror's pole. The image is 1/3 the size of the object and has the same orientation."
