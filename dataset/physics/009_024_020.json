    "message_1": "A student wants to design a pair of sunglasses that only allow vertically polarized light to pass through. They have access to a polarizer that transmits only horizontally polarized light. What additional components and/or design modifications are needed to create these sunglasses? How much light will be transmitted through the sunglasses?",
    "message_2": "To create sunglasses that only allow vertically polarized light to pass through, the student needs to rotate the horizontally polarizing filter by 90 degrees. This will change the orientation of the polarizer, allowing only vertically polarized light to pass through.\n\nWhen the polarizer is rotated by 90 degrees, the amount of light transmitted through the sunglasses will depend on the initial polarization of the incoming light. If the incoming light is unpolarized, then approximately 50% of the light will be transmitted through the sunglasses. This is because unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of horizontally and vertically polarized light, and the rotated polarizer will only transmit the vertically polarized component.\n\nIf the incoming light is already polarized, the amount of light transmitted through the sunglasses will depend on the angle between the polarization direction of the incoming light and the vertical direction. The transmitted light intensity can be calculated using Malus' law:\n\nI = I0 * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted light intensity, I0 is the initial light intensity, and theta is the angle between the polarization direction of the incoming light and the vertical direction. If the incoming light is horizontally polarized (theta = 90 degrees), no light will be transmitted through the sunglasses. If the incoming light is vertically polarized (theta = 0 degrees), all of the light will be transmitted through the sunglasses."
