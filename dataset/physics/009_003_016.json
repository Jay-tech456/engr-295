    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence at which total internal reflection begins, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(i2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (glass and water, respectively), i1 is the angle of incidence, and i2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of refraction (i2) must be 90 degrees. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle of incidence (i1):\n\nsin(i1) = n2 / n1\n\nPlugging in the given refractive indices for glass (1.5) and water (1.3):\n\nsin(i1) = 1.3 / 1.5\nsin(i1) ≈ 0.8667\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle of incidence by taking the inverse sine of 0.8667:\n\ni1 = arcsin(0.8667)\ni1 ≈ 60.3 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence at which total internal reflection begins is approximately 60.3 degrees."
