    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a photon in a relativistic quantum model, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / 位\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and 位 is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nGiven the wavelength 位 = 500 nm, we need to convert it to meters:\n\n位 = 500 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy of the photon:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5 x 10^-7 m)\nE = 3.978 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 500 nm in a relativistic quantum model is approximately 3.978 x 10^-19 Joules."
