    "message_2": "Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are a class of theoretical models that attempt to unify the three non-gravitational forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force. One of the key predictions of GUTs is that protons, which are considered stable particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, can decay through processes mediated by new, heavy particles called X and Y bosons.\n\nThe predicted decay modes of protons in GUTs include:\n\n1. Proton decaying into a positron and a neutral pion: p → e+ + π0\n2. Proton decaying into a neutrino and a charged pion: p → ν + π+\n3. Proton decaying into a neutrino and a charged kaon: p → ν + K+\n\nThe lifetime of the proton is predicted to be extremely long, typically on the order of 10^30 to 10^36 years, depending on the specific GUT model.\n\nExperimental searches for proton decay have been conducted for several decades using large underground detectors filled with water or other materials. These detectors are designed to observe the products of proton decay, such as positrons, neutrinos, and mesons. Some of the most notable experiments include the Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO).\n\nSo far, no experiment has observed a clear signal of proton decay, which has led to increasingly stringent lower limits on the proton lifetime. For example, the Super-Kamiokande experiment has set a lower limit on the proton lifetime for the decay mode p → e+ + π0 at 1.6 x 10^34 years.\n\nThe lack of experimental evidence for proton decay has constrained and ruled out some GUT models, but it has not entirely disproven the concept of grand unification. There are still many GUT models that predict proton decay rates below the current experimental limits. Future experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and the Hyper-Kamiokande, will continue to search for proton decay with improved sensitivity, potentially providing further insights into the validity of GUTs and the nature of fundamental forces."
