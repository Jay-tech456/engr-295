    "message_2": "The Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) and the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM) are both extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics that incorporate supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that predicts a partner particle (sparticle) for each known particle in the Standard Model. Supersymmetry aims to address several issues in the Standard Model, such as the hierarchy problem and the unification of fundamental forces.\n\nThe main difference between the MSSM and the NMSSM lies in the Higgs sector, which is responsible for the generation of particle masses through the Higgs mechanism.\n\nIn the MSSM, there are two Higgs doublets, leading to a total of five physical Higgs bosons: two neutral CP-even (h and H), one neutral CP-odd (A), and two charged Higgs bosons (H+ and H-). The MSSM has more than 100 free parameters, which makes it challenging to constrain the model experimentally. However, the MSSM Higgs sector can be described by just two parameters, usually chosen as the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson (MA) and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tanÎ²).\n\nThe NMSSM extends the MSSM by introducing an additional singlet Higgs field, which mixes with the MSSM Higgs doublets. This results in a more complex Higgs sector with seven physical Higgs bosons: three neutral CP-even (h1, h2, and h3), two neutral CP-odd (a1 and a2), and two charged Higgs bosons (H+ and H-). The NMSSM has fewer free parameters than the MSSM, which makes it more predictive and easier to constrain experimentally.\n\nThe predicted properties of the Higgs boson in each model are affected by the differences in the Higgs sector:\n\n1. Mass: In the MSSM, the lightest CP-even Higgs boson (h) has an upper mass limit of around 135 GeV, while in the NMSSM, the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson (h1) can be significantly lighter or heavier due to the additional singlet field.\n\n2. Couplings: The couplings of the Higgs bosons to other particles can be different in the MSSM and NMSSM. In the MSSM, the couplings of the lightest Higgs boson (h) to fermions and gauge bosons are similar to those in the Standard Model, while in the NMSSM, the couplings of the lightest Higgs boson (h1) can be significantly modified due to the mixing with the singlet field.\n\n3. Decays: The decay modes of the Higgs bosons can also be different in the MSSM and NMSSM. For example, in the NMSSM, the lightest Higgs boson (h1) can decay into a pair of lighter CP-odd Higgs bosons (a1), which is not possible in the MSSM.\n\nExperimental searches for Higgs bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have so far discovered a Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV, which is consistent with both the MSSM and NMSSM. However, the observed properties of this Higgs boson, such as its couplings to other particles, are more consistent with the Standard Model than with either the MSSM or NMSSM. Further experimental data and theoretical developments are needed to determine whether the observed Higgs boson is indeed the one predicted by supersymmetric models and to distinguish between the MSSM and NMSSM."
