    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a single loop and then multiply it by the number of turns in the coil.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field B at the center of a single loop of radius R carrying a current I is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nIn this problem, we have a coil with 20 turns, a radius of 10 cm (0.1 m), and a current of 2 A. Therefore, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil as follows:\n\nB_single_loop = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB_single_loop = (8π × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2 m\n\nNow, we can multiply the magnetic field of a single loop by the number of turns (N = 20) to find the total magnetic field at the center of the coil:\n\nB_total = N * B_single_loop\nB_total = 20 * (8π × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2 m\nB_total = (160π × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2 m\n\nB_total ≈ 2.513 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular coil is approximately 2.513 × 10^(-5) T."
