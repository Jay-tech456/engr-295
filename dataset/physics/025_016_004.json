    "message_2": "The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) through cellular respiration involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The overall reaction can be represented as:\n\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy\n\nThe energy released during this process is mainly in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules. The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule yields approximately 36-38 ATP molecules, depending on the efficiency of the process in the specific organism.\n\nTo calculate the heat released, we need to consider the energy released per ATP molecule. The hydrolysis of one ATP molecule to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) releases approximately 7.3 kcal/mol (30.5 kJ/mol) of energy.\n\nAssuming 36 ATP molecules are produced per glucose molecule, the total energy released is:\n\nEnergy = 36 ATP/glucose × 7.3 kcal/mol\nEnergy ≈ 262.8 kcal/mol\n\nSo, approximately 262.8 kcal/mol (1099 kJ/mol) of heat is released when one molecule of glucose undergoes complete oxidation in the human body through the process of cellular respiration."
