    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a focal length of 15 cm. An object is placed 30 cm in front of the mirror. What is the position of the image formed by the mirror and is it real or virtual?",
    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 15 cm, u = -30 cm (negative sign indicates the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 30v to eliminate fractions:\n\n2v = -v + 30v^2\n\nNow, simplifying and solving for v:\n\n3v = 30v^2\nv^2 = 1/10\nv = ±√(1/10)\n\nSince the image distance (v) cannot be negative in this case (a negative value would indicate a virtual image on the same side as the object, which is not possible for a concave mirror), we take the positive value:\n\nv = √(1/10)\nv ≈ 0.316 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at approximately 0.316 cm in front of the mirror. Since the image is formed in front of the mirror, it is a real image."
