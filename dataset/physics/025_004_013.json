    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at a given temperature and pH, we need to know the initial concentration of reactants and products, as well as the equilibrium constant (K_eq). The formula to calculate ΔG is:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K_eq)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K in this case), and ln is the natural logarithm.\n\nHowever, since we are given the initial concentrations of reactants and products, we need to calculate the reaction quotient (Q) first. The reaction quotient is the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants, raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. Let's assume the general reaction:\n\naA + bB ⇌ cC + dD\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) is given by:\n\nQ = ([C]^c [D]^d) / ([A]^a [B]^b)\n\nwhere [A], [B], [C], and [D] are the initial concentrations of the respective species.\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between ΔG, ΔG° (standard Gibbs free energy change), and Q:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nTo find ΔG°, we can use the relationship between ΔG° and K_eq:\n\nΔG° = -RT ln(K_eq)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for ΔG° into the equation for ΔG:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K_eq) + RT ln(Q)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the equation:\n\nΔG = RT ln(Q/K_eq)\n\nNow, you can plug in the given values for the initial concentrations of reactants and products to calculate Q, and then use the given K_eq and the temperature (298 K) to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction at pH 7."
