    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment is a classic experiment in physics that provides evidence for the quantization of atomic energy levels. In this experiment, electrons are accelerated through a low-pressure gas of mercury atoms, and the energy transfer between the electrons and the mercury atoms is studied. The relationship between the energy levels of a mercury atom and the observed peaks in the Franck-Hertz experiment can be understood by examining the process of inelastic collisions between the electrons and the mercury atoms.\n\nWhen an electron has sufficient energy, it can collide with a mercury atom and excite it to a higher energy level. This process is called an inelastic collision, as the electron loses some of its kinetic energy to excite the mercury atom. The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the mercury atom is quantized, meaning that it can only take specific discrete values.\n\nIn the Franck-Hertz experiment, the electrons are accelerated by applying a voltage across the gas-filled tube. As the accelerating voltage is increased, the electrons gain more kinetic energy. When the kinetic energy of the electron matches the energy difference between two energy levels of the mercury atom, the electron can excite the mercury atom to the higher energy level, losing its kinetic energy in the process.\n\nAfter the inelastic collision, the excited mercury atom eventually returns to its ground state by emitting a photon with the same energy as the energy difference between the two levels. This process is called fluorescence. The emitted photons can be detected and their energies can be measured.\n\nThe observed peaks in the Franck-Hertz experiment correspond to the voltages at which the electrons have just enough energy to excite the mercury atoms to a higher energy level. These peaks provide evidence for the quantization of atomic energy levels, as they show that the energy transfer between the electrons and the mercury atoms can only occur in discrete amounts. The spacing between the peaks is equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the mercury atom, further supporting the idea of quantized energy levels.\n\nIn summary, the Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates the quantization of atomic energy levels by showing that energy transfer between electrons and mercury atoms can only occur in discrete amounts. The observed peaks in the experiment correspond to the specific energy differences between the ground state and excited states of the mercury atom, providing strong evidence for the quantization of atomic energy levels."
