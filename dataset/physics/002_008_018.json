    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of aluminum, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat input (500 J), m is the mass of the aluminum (50 g), c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature (80°C - 20°C = 60°C).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 500 J / (50 g * 60°C)\n\nc = 500 J / 3000 g°C\n\nc = 0.1667 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of aluminum is approximately 0.1667 J/g°C."
