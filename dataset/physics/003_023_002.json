    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square has four sides with equal length, we can find the magnetic field due to one side and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square. The length of the side is 10 cm or 0.1 m. We can divide this side into small current elements dl. For each small current element, we can find the magnetic field dB at the center of the square and then integrate over the entire side.\n\nThe position vector r for each current element is perpendicular to the plane of the square and has a magnitude equal to half the side length (0.1 m / 2 = 0.05 m). Since dl and r are perpendicular, the cross product dl x r simplifies to |dl||r|sin(90°) = dl * r.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Biot-Savart law for one side of the square:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating over the entire side, we get the magnetic field due to one side:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * r) / (4π * r³) * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl over the entire side is just the side length (0.1 m):\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * r) / (4π * r³) * 0.1\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and r:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.05 m) / (4π * (0.05 m)³) * 0.1 m\n\nB_side ≈ 1.0 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSince there are four sides in the square, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side ≈ 4.0 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the square and can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. For the square loop, the magnetic field direction due to each side will be pointing outwards from the center of the square. When you sum up the magnetic fields from all four sides, they will reinforce each other, and the total magnetic field will also be pointing outwards from the center of the square.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square is approximately 4.0 × 10^(-5) T, and its direction is perpendicular to the plane of the square, pointing outwards from the center."
