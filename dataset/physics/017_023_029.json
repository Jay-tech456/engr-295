    "message_2": "The external magnetic field has a significant impact on the domain wall width and skyrmion size in a ferromagnetic thin film. To understand this, let's first briefly discuss what domain walls and skyrmions are.\n\nIn ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic moments of the atoms tend to align in the same direction, forming regions called magnetic domains. The domain wall is the boundary between two adjacent magnetic domains with different orientations of the magnetic moments. The width of the domain wall is determined by the balance between the exchange energy (which favors parallel alignment of neighboring magnetic moments) and the magnetostatic energy (which favors the formation of closed magnetic flux loops to minimize stray fields).\n\nSkyrmions are topologically stable magnetic structures that can be found in ferromagnetic thin films. They are characterized by a swirling arrangement of magnetic moments, with a core where the moments point in the opposite direction of the surrounding moments. The size of a skyrmion is determined by the balance between the exchange energy, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the magnetostatic energy.\n\nNow, let's discuss how the external magnetic field affects the domain wall width and skyrmion size in a ferromagnetic thin film:\n\n1. Domain wall width: When an external magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic thin film, it affects the magnetostatic energy of the system. The magnetic field tends to align the magnetic moments in the direction of the field, which can lead to a decrease in the domain wall width. This is because the applied field reduces the energy barrier between the two domains, allowing the moments to align more easily and resulting in a narrower domain wall. However, if the external magnetic field is too strong, it can cause the domain wall to be completely destroyed, as all the magnetic moments align with the field.\n\n2. Skyrmion size: The external magnetic field also affects the skyrmion size in a ferromagnetic thin film. When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film plane, it can stabilize the skyrmion structure by increasing the energy barrier for the skyrmion to collapse into a uniform state. This stabilization effect can lead to a reduction in the skyrmion size, as the magnetic moments are more strongly confined by the field. On the other hand, if the magnetic field is applied in the plane of the film, it can destabilize the skyrmion structure and cause it to expand or even be destroyed, depending on the field strength and direction.\n\nIn summary, the external magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining the domain wall width and skyrmion size in a ferromagnetic thin film. The field can either stabilize or destabilize these magnetic structures, leading to changes in their dimensions and properties. Understanding these effects is essential for the development of advanced magnetic materials and devices, such as magnetic memory and logic systems."
