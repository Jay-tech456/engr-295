    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the protein undergoing thermal denaturation, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆H is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the entropy change.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 70°C + 273.15\nT(K) = 343.15 K\n\nNext, we need to convert the entropy change from J/K/mol to kJ/K/mol:\n\n∆S = 800 J/K/mol * (1 kJ / 1000 J)\n∆S = 0.8 kJ/K/mol\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n∆G = 250 kJ/mol - (343.15 K * 0.8 kJ/K/mol)\n∆G = 250 kJ/mol - 274.52 kJ/mol\n∆G = -24.52 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the protein undergoing thermal denaturation at 70°C is -24.52 kJ/mol."
