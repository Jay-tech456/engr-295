    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nA beam of light is travelling through a transparent medium with an index of refraction of 1.6. The angle of incidence of the beam on the interface with the second medium is gradually increased. At what angle will the beam undergo total internal reflection? Provide the critical angle in degrees.",
    "message_2": "Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. The critical angle can be calculated using Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees, and we want to find the angle of incidence (θ1) when total internal reflection occurs. The index of refraction of the first medium (n1) is 1.6, and we'll assume the second medium is air, with an index of refraction (n2) of 1.\n\n1.6 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.6\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.6)\n\nθ1 ≈ 38.21°\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection is approximately 38.21 degrees."
