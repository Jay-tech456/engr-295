    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field due to a current-carrying sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the problem involves a solid sphere, we need to consider the current distribution within the sphere. Let's assume that the current is uniformly distributed throughout the sphere.\n\nFirst, we need to find the current density (J) within the sphere. The total current (I) is 2 A, and the volume (V) of the sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere (0.1 m).\n\nV = (4/3)π(0.1)^3 = (4/3)π(0.001) = 4.18879 × 10^-3 m^3\n\nNow, we can find the current density J:\n\nJ = I / V = 2 A / 4.18879 × 10^-3 m^3 = 477.46 A/m^3\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the magnetic field (B) due to a uniformly distributed current within a sphere:\n\nB = (μ₀ * J * r) / 3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), J is the current density, and r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nSince the point is located 0.2 m away from the center of the sphere, which is outside the sphere, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field outside the sphere:\n\nB = (2/3) * (μ₀ * J * R^3) / r^3\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere (0.1 m) and r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point (0.2 m).\n\nB = (2/3) * (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 477.46 A/m^3 * (0.1 m)^3) / (0.2 m)^3\nB = (2/3) * (6.008 × 10^-7 T * 0.001 m^3) / 0.008 m^3\nB = 0.000100134 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located 0.2 m away from the center of the sphere is approximately 1.001 × 10^-4 T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it will be radially outward from the center of the sphere, since the current is uniformly distributed within the sphere."
