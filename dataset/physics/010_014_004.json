    "message_2": "To find the Mach number of a supersonic flow that generates a shock wave with an angle of 60 degrees, we can use the oblique shock wave relations. The formula to find the Mach number (M1) before the shock wave is:\n\ntan(β) = 2 * cot(θ) * [(M1^2 * sin^2(θ) - 1) / (M1^2 * (γ + cos(2 * θ)) + 2)]\n\nwhere β is the shock wave angle, θ is the flow deflection angle, and γ is the specific heat ratio.\n\nGiven the shock wave angle (β) is 60 degrees, we can find the flow deflection angle (θ) using the relation:\n\nβ = θ + 90°\n\nθ = β - 90°\nθ = 60° - 90°\nθ = -30°\n\nHowever, since the flow deflection angle cannot be negative, we must have made an error in our assumption. The correct relation between β and θ is:\n\nβ = 90° - θ\n\nNow we can find the flow deflection angle:\n\nθ = 90° - β\nθ = 90° - 60°\nθ = 30°\n\nNow we can use the oblique shock wave formula to find the Mach number (M1):\n\ntan(60°) = 2 * cot(30°) * [(M1^2 * sin^2(30°) - 1) / (M1^2 * (1.4 + cos(2 * 30°)) + 2)]\n\n1.732 = 2 * 1.732 * [(M1^2 * 0.25 - 1) / (M1^2 * (1.4 + 0.5) + 2)]\n\n1 = [(M1^2 * 0.25 - 1) / (M1^2 * 1.9 + 2)]\n\nM1^2 * 1.9 + 2 = M1^2 * 0.25 - 1\n\n1.65 * M1^2 = 3\n\nM1^2 = 3 / 1.65\n\nM1^2 = 1.818\n\nM1 = sqrt(1.818)\n\nM1 ≈ 1.35\n\nSo, the Mach number of the supersonic flow that generates a shock wave with an angle of 60 degrees is approximately 1.35."
