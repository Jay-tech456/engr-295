    "message_2": "The weak mixing angle, also known as the Weinberg angle or the electroweak mixing angle, is a parameter in the Standard Model of Particle Physics that quantifies the mixing between the electromagnetic and weak forces. It is usually denoted by the symbol θ_W.\n\nThe value of the weak mixing angle in the Standard Model, assuming no new physics beyond the Standard Model, is determined through a variety of experimental measurements. One common way to express the weak mixing angle is through the sine of the angle, sin²θ_W. The current best estimate for sin²θ_W is approximately 0.23122.\n\nThe experimental uncertainty in the measured value of the weak mixing angle can be obtained from the Particle Data Group (PDG), which compiles experimental results from various sources. As of the 2020 PDG review, the uncertainty in sin²θ_W is ±0.00005.\n\nThe theoretical prediction of the weak mixing angle is derived from the masses of the W and Z bosons, which are also experimentally measured. The theoretical value of sin²θ_W is in good agreement with the experimental value, with the difference between them being well within the experimental uncertainty.\n\nIn summary, the value of the weak mixing angle in the Standard Model is sin²θ_W ≈ 0.23122, with an experimental uncertainty of ±0.00005. The theoretical prediction is consistent with the experimental value, providing strong support for the Standard Model of Particle Physics."
