    "message_2": "To find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and T1 are the reference vapor pressure and temperature, P2 and T2 are the vapor pressure and temperature we want to find, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe can use the reference values for water at the boiling point (100°C or 373.15 K) with a vapor pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). We want to find the vapor pressure at 25°C (298.15 K).\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -40,700 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40,700 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3.169 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3.169 kPa."
