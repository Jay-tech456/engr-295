    "message_2": "The mass of a black hole plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of it being a source of primordial black holes (PBHs). Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang, due to density fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThe likelihood of a black hole being a source of primordial black holes depends on its mass because the formation of PBHs is more probable in regions with higher density fluctuations. Smaller black holes, with masses comparable to or smaller than the mass of the Sun, are more likely to be primordial black holes. This is because they could have formed from the collapse of high-density regions in the early universe, whereas larger black holes are typically formed from the collapse of massive stars or the merging of smaller black holes.\n\nThe predicted distribution of primordial black hole masses is still a subject of ongoing research and debate among physicists. However, some theoretical models suggest that the mass distribution of PBHs should follow a power-law or log-normal distribution, with a peak at around 10^(-5) solar masses and extending up to several solar masses. This distribution is based on the assumption that the density fluctuations in the early universe were scale-invariant, meaning that they had the same amplitude at all length scales.\n\nIt is important to note that the existence of primordial black holes has not yet been confirmed through direct observation, and their predicted mass distribution is based on theoretical models and assumptions. Future observations, such as those from gravitational wave detectors and other astronomical surveys, may help to constrain the properties of primordial black holes and provide more accurate predictions for their mass distribution."
