    "message_2": "The difference in the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms in the presence and absence of an electric field is due to the Stark effect. The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. This effect was discovered by Johannes Stark in 1913.\n\nIn the absence of an electric field, the energy levels of hydrogen atoms are determined by their principal quantum number (n) and the azimuthal quantum number (l). The spectral lines correspond to the transitions between these energy levels.\n\nWhen an electric field is applied, the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are perturbed, leading to a shift and splitting of the spectral lines. This occurs because the electric field interacts with the electric dipole moment of the atom, causing a change in the energy levels. The Stark effect can be classified into two types: linear Stark effect and quadratic Stark effect.\n\n1. Linear Stark effect: This occurs when the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the strength of the electric field. This is observed in atoms or molecules with a non-zero electric dipole moment, such as hydrogen in excited states with non-zero orbital angular momentum (l â‰  0).\n\n2. Quadratic Stark effect: This occurs when the splitting of the energy levels is proportional to the square of the electric field strength. This is observed in atoms or molecules with a zero electric dipole moment, such as hydrogen in its ground state (n = 1, l = 0).\n\nThe difference in the spectral lines due to the Stark effect varies with the strength of the electric field. As the electric field strength increases, the splitting and shifting of the spectral lines become more pronounced. In the linear Stark effect, the splitting is directly proportional to the electric field strength, while in the quadratic Stark effect, the splitting is proportional to the square of the electric field strength.\n\nIn summary, the presence of an electric field causes the spectral lines of hydrogen atoms to shift and split due to the Stark effect. The difference in the spectral lines varies with the strength of the electric field, with the splitting being directly proportional to the electric field strength in the linear Stark effect and proportional to the square of the electric field strength in the quadratic Stark effect."
