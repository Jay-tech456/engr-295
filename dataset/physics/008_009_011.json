    "message_2": "The QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) phase transition refers to the transition between the hadronic phase, where quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons (such as protons and neutrons), and the quark-gluon plasma phase, where quarks and gluons are deconfined and can move freely.\n\nThe critical temperature for the QCD phase transition is estimated to be around 150-170 MeV (million electron volts), which corresponds to approximately 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin. The critical energy density required for this transition is estimated to be around 0.5-1.0 GeV/fm^3 (giga-electron volts per cubic femtometer).\n\nWhen the critical temperature and energy density are reached, the behavior of quarks and gluons changes significantly. In the hadronic phase, quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons due to the strong force, which is mediated by gluons. However, in the quark-gluon plasma phase, the strong force becomes weaker at short distances, allowing quarks and gluons to move freely and interact with each other directly. This deconfinement leads to a new state of matter with unique properties, such as a very low viscosity and a high degree of thermalization.\n\nStudying the QCD phase transition and the properties of quark-gluon plasma is important for understanding the early universe, as it is believed that the universe went through this phase transition shortly after the Big Bang. Additionally, it can provide insights into the fundamental nature of the strong force and the behavior of quarks and gluons under extreme conditions."
