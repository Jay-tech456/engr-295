    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of energy levels in atoms due to the presence of an external electric field. In the case of the hydrogen atom, the Stark effect can be analyzed using perturbation theory. For simplicity, let's consider the linear Stark effect, which occurs for the n=2 energy level of the hydrogen atom.\n\nThe energy shift due to the linear Stark effect can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = -e * F * d\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^(-19) C), F is the external electric field, and d is the electric dipole moment.\n\nFor the n=2 energy level of the hydrogen atom, the electric dipole moment can be calculated as:\n\nd = 3a₀ * e\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius (approximately 5.29 × 10^(-11) m).\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy shift due to the linear Stark effect:\n\nΔE = -e * F * d\nΔE = -(1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (200 N/C) * (3 * 5.29 × 10^(-11) m)\nΔE ≈ -5.04 × 10^(-18) J\n\nThe magnitude of the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom when subjected to an external electric field of 200 N/C is approximately 5.04 × 10^(-18) J."
