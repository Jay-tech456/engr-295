    "message_1": "A student wants to measure the length of a moving object using relativistic optics. The object moves at a speed of 0.8c relative to the student, and the light used to measure its length is emitted by a stationary source. If the measured length of the object is 4 meters, what is its proper length?",
    "message_2": "To find the proper length of the moving object, we can use the length contraction formula in special relativity:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the measured length (4 meters), L0 is the proper length (the length of the object when it is at rest relative to the observer), v is the relative velocity of the object (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe want to find L0, so we can rearrange the formula:\n\nL0 = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL0 = 4 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL0 = 4 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL0 = 4 / sqrt(0.36)\n\nL0 = 4 / 0.6\n\nL0 â‰ˆ 6.67 meters\n\nSo, the proper length of the object is approximately 6.67 meters."
