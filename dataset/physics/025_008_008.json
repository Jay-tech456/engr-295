    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated by a muscle fiber during contraction, we can use the following formula:\n\nForce (F) = Cross-sectional area (A) × Tension development per unit area (T)\n\nWhere:\n- Force (F) is the force generated by the muscle fiber during contraction, measured in Newtons (N)\n- Cross-sectional area (A) is the area of the muscle fiber, measured in square meters (m²)\n- Tension development per unit area (T) is the tension generated by the muscle fiber per unit area, measured in Pascals (Pa)\n\nSo, F = A × T"
