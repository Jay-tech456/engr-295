    "message_1": "What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two merging black holes with masses of 10 and 20 solar masses respectively, assuming they are located 1 billion light years away and the resulting black hole has a mass of 28 solar masses? How would this frequency change if the distance to the black holes was increased to 2 billion light years?",
    "message_2": "The frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two merging black holes can be estimated using the chirp mass formula and the inspiral phase of the binary system. The chirp mass (M_c) is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes. In this case, m1 = 10 solar masses and m2 = 20 solar masses. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nM_c = (10 * 20)^(3/5) / (10 + 20)^(1/5) ≈ 15.47 solar masses\n\nDuring the inspiral phase, the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves is related to the chirp mass by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5 / 96)^(3/8) * (π * M_c)^(-5/8) * (d/dt) (M_c^(3/5) * t_c^(3/8))\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t_c is the time until coalescence. However, we can simplify this expression by considering the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which is given by:\n\nf_ISCO = c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * (m1 + m2))\n\nPlugging in the values for m1 and m2, we get:\n\nf_ISCO ≈ 220 Hz\n\nThis is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the two merging black holes.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of increasing the distance to the black holes from 1 billion light years to 2 billion light years. The frequency of the gravitational waves does not depend on the distance to the source. Therefore, the frequency of the gravitational waves would remain the same (approximately 220 Hz) even if the distance to the black holes was increased to 2 billion light years.\n\nHowever, the amplitude of the gravitational waves would decrease as the distance increases. The amplitude is inversely proportional to the distance, so if the distance is doubled, the amplitude would be halved. This would make the gravitational waves more challenging to detect, but the frequency would remain unchanged."
