    "message_2": "Observable effects that can provide evidence for the existence of a black hole include:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Black holes have strong gravitational fields that can bend light from distant stars and galaxies. This bending of light, known as gravitational lensing, can be observed and used as evidence for the presence of a black hole.\n\n2. Accretion disk: When a black hole is part of a binary system, it can pull matter from its companion star. This matter forms an accretion disk around the black hole, which emits X-rays and other electromagnetic radiation due to the intense heat and friction. Observations of these emissions can provide evidence for the existence of a black hole.\n\n3. Jets: Some black holes produce jets of high-energy particles that are emitted from their poles. These jets can be observed in radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths, providing evidence for the presence of a black hole.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: When two black holes merge, they produce gravitational waves that can be detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. The detection of these waves provides direct evidence for the existence of black holes.\n\nThese observations can be used to identify and classify different types of black holes:\n\n1. Stellar-mass black holes: These black holes are formed by the gravitational collapse of massive stars. They typically have masses between 3 and 20 times that of the Sun. Observations of X-ray emissions from accretion disks and the motion of companion stars in binary systems can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole and identify it as a stellar-mass black hole.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass black holes: These black holes have masses between 100 and 10,000 times that of the Sun. They are thought to form in dense stellar environments like globular clusters. Observations of gravitational lensing, X-ray emissions, and the motion of surrounding stars can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole and identify it as an intermediate-mass black hole.\n\n3. Supermassive black holes: These black holes have masses between millions and billions of times that of the Sun. They are found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Observations of the motion of stars and gas near the galactic center, as well as the detection of powerful jets and X-ray emissions, can be used to estimate the mass of the black hole and identify it as a supermassive black hole.\n\n4. Primordial black holes: These hypothetical black holes are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They could have a wide range of masses, from much smaller than the Sun to thousands of times its mass. While no primordial black holes have been definitively observed, their existence could be inferred through gravitational lensing, the motion of surrounding matter, or the detection of gravitational waves from merging primordial black holes."
