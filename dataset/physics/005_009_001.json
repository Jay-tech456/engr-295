    "message_1": "A rocket is moving towards Earth at 0.8c. A radio signal with a frequency of 5 GHz is emitted from the rocket. What is the frequency of the radio signal as measured by an observer on Earth? (Assume the speed of light in a vacuum is 3 x 10^8 m/s)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. The formula for the observed frequency (f') when the source is moving towards the observer is:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f is the emitted frequency, v is the velocity of the source (the rocket), and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nf = 5 GHz = 5 x 10^9 Hz\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nf' = (5 x 10^9 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\nf' = (5 x 10^9 Hz) * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\nf' = (5 x 10^9 Hz) * sqrt(9)\nf' = (5 x 10^9 Hz) * 3\n\nf' = 15 x 10^9 Hz = 15 GHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the radio signal as measured by an observer on Earth is 15 GHz."
