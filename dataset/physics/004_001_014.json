    "message_2": "To calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a binary black hole coalescence event detected by LIGO, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Distance from the source (D)\n2. Masses of the black holes (m1 and m2)\n3. Sensitivity curve of the detector (S(f))\n\nFirst, we need to compute the characteristic strain (hc) of the gravitational wave signal. The characteristic strain is a measure of the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal and depends on the masses of the black holes and their distance from the detector. For a binary black hole system, the characteristic strain can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nhc(f) = (8 * π^(2/3) * G^(5/3) * M^(5/3) * f^(-7/6)) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere:\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational wave signal\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))\n- M is the chirp mass of the binary system, given by M = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- D is the distance from the source\n\nNext, we need to compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using the characteristic strain and the sensitivity curve of the detector. The SNR can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nSNR = sqrt(4 * ∫ (hc(f)^2 / S(f)) df)\n\nwhere:\n- hc(f) is the characteristic strain at frequency f\n- S(f) is the sensitivity curve of the detector at frequency f\n- The integral is taken over the frequency range of interest (typically from ~10 Hz to a few kHz for LIGO)\n\nTo compute the SNR, you need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the chirp mass M using the masses of the black holes (m1 and m2).\n2. Compute the characteristic strain hc(f) for the frequency range of interest.\n3. Obtain the sensitivity curve S(f) for the LIGO detector.\n4. Integrate the ratio of hc(f)^2 / S(f) over the frequency range of interest.\n5. Take the square root of the integral to obtain the SNR.\n\nNote that this calculation involves numerical integration and may require specialized software or programming tools."
