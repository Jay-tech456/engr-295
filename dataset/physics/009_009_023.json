    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification formula is given by:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nWe are given that the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the magnification (M) is 3 times the size of the object, so M = 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the image distance (v) using the magnification formula:\n\n3 = -v/u\nv = -3u\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for v into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/u + 1/(-3u)\n\nTo solve for u, we can find a common denominator and simplify the equation:\n\n1/20 = (-3u + u) / (3u^2)\n1/20 = -2u / (3u^2)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n-40u = 3u^2\n\nDivide both sides by -1:\n\n40u = -3u^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n3u^2 + 40u = 0\n\nFactor out the common factor u:\n\nu(3u + 40) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions for u:\n\n1) u = 0 (This solution is not valid, as it would mean the object is at the lens itself.)\n2) 3u + 40 = 0 => u = -40/3 cm (This solution is also not valid, as it would mean the object is on the same side as the image, which is not possible for a converging lens.)\n\nSince both solutions are not valid for a converging lens, it is not possible to achieve a magnification of 3 times the size of the object with a converging lens of focal length 20 cm."
