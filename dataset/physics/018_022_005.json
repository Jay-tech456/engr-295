    "message_2": "The decay width of a particle is a measure of its decay rate, which is related to its lifetime. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Z boson is a neutral, massive vector boson that mediates the weak force. Its decay width can be calculated theoretically using the principles of quantum field theory and electroweak interactions.\n\nThe total decay width of the Z boson (Γ_Z) in the Standard Model is approximately 2.4952 GeV. This value is obtained by summing up the partial decay widths for all possible decay channels of the Z boson, which include decays into quark-antiquark pairs, charged lepton-antilepton pairs, and neutrino-antineutrino pairs.\n\nExperimental measurements of the Z boson decay width have been performed at particle accelerator experiments, such as those at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN and the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC). The combined results from these experiments give a measured value of Γ_Z = 2.495 ± 0.0023 GeV.\n\nThe agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of the Z boson decay width is excellent, which provides strong support for the validity of the Standard Model. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN continues to study the properties of the Z boson and other particles, further testing the predictions of the Standard Model and searching for new physics beyond it."
