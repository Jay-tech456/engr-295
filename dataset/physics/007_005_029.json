    "message_2": "The most feasible and effective method for storing nuclear waste with a half-life of over 10,000 years is deep geological repositories (DGRs). DGRs involve storing the nuclear waste in stable rock formations deep underground, typically at depths of 300 to 1,000 meters. This method isolates the waste from the biosphere and provides multiple barriers to prevent the release of radioactive materials into the environment.\n\nThe process of creating a DGR includes:\n\n1. Selecting a suitable site with stable geological conditions, low seismic activity, and minimal groundwater flow.\n2. Designing and constructing the repository with multiple barriers, such as engineered barriers (e.g., waste containers, buffer materials) and natural barriers (e.g., the host rock).\n3. Emplacing the waste in the repository and sealing it with materials like bentonite clay and concrete to prevent water infiltration and radionuclide migration.\n4. Monitoring the repository during and after its operational phase to ensure its safety and performance.\n\nDGRs have been deemed the most promising solution for long-term nuclear waste management by various international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). Countries like Finland, Sweden, and France are already in the process of implementing DGRs for their high-level nuclear waste.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that public acceptance and long-term safety remain key challenges in implementing DGRs. Engaging with local communities, transparent decision-making processes, and rigorous safety assessments are crucial to address these concerns."
