    "message_1": "A system with a volume of 2.5 L undergoes a process where 500 J of work is done on the system, and 300 J of heat is added to the system. Calculate the internal energy change of the system.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the internal energy change of the system, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W).\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nIn this case, we are given that 300 J of heat is added to the system (Q = 300 J) and 500 J of work is done on the system (W = -500 J, since work is done on the system, not by the system).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔU = 300 J - (-500 J)\n\nΔU = 300 J + 500 J\n\nΔU = 800 J\n\nSo, the internal energy change of the system is 800 J."
