    "message_2": "The estimated percentage of dark matter in the observable universe is approximately 27%. This percentage is derived from various observations and calculations made by astrophysicists.\n\nAstrophysicists calculate the percentage of dark matter in the universe using several methods, including:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the residual radiation from the Big Bang. By studying the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, astrophysicists can determine the density of different components in the universe, including dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter does not emit or absorb light, but it does have mass, which means it can bend light through gravity. By observing how light from distant galaxies is bent, astrophysicists can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter.\n\n3. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation speeds of stars in galaxies can be used to determine the mass distribution within the galaxy. Observations show that stars at the edges of galaxies rotate faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be used to infer the presence of dark matter. Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in the formation of these structures, as its gravitational influence helps to pull matter together.\n\nBy combining these methods and analyzing the data, astrophysicists have determined that dark matter makes up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the observable universe. The remaining mass-energy content is comprised of about 68% dark energy and only about 5% ordinary (baryonic) matter."
