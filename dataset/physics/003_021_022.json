    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil with 1000 turns and a secondary coil with 5000 turns. The primary coil carries a current of 5 A. What is the magnetic field at the center of the transformer due to the primary coil?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the transformer due to the primary coil, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to directly calculate the magnetic field using this formula. We need the radius (r) of the primary coil, which is not provided in the problem. \n\nIf you can provide the radius of the primary coil, we can proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, we cannot determine the magnetic field at the center of the transformer due to the primary coil with the given information."
