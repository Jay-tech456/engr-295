    "message_2": "To calculate the rest mass of an electron given its energy, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The equation is as follows:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the electron, m is the rest mass of the electron, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the electron.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the energy of the electron (E) as 1 MeV (Mega-electronvolt). We need to convert this energy to Joules using the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, 1 MeV = 1 x 10^6 eV = 1 x 10^6 x 1.60218 x 10^(-19) J = 1.60218 x 10^(-13) J\n\nNow, we can rewrite the energy-momentum relation as:\n\n(mc²)² = E² - (pc)²\n\nWe know that the rest mass of an electron (m) is approximately 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. We need to find the momentum (p) of the electron.\n\nSince we are given the energy of the electron and not its momentum, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the momentum:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nRearranging for p:\n\np = sqrt((E² - (mc²)²) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\np = sqrt(((1.60218 x 10^(-13) J)² - ((9.109 x 10^(-31) kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)²)²) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)²)\n\np ≈ 5.344 x 10^(-22) kg m/s\n\nNow that we have the momentum, we can plug it back into the energy-momentum relation to find the rest mass of the electron:\n\n(mc²)² = E² - (pc)²\n\nRearranging for m:\n\nm = sqrt((E² - (pc)²) / c^4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = sqrt(((1.60218 x 10^(-13) J)² - ((5.344 x 10^(-22) kg m/s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s))²) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^4)\n\nm ≈ 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg\n\nSo, the rest mass of the electron in a vacuum is approximately 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg."
