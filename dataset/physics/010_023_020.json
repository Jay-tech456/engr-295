    "message_2": "To determine the maximum depth that a sound wave can travel in the ocean waters, we need to consider the sound speed equation derived from geophysical fluid dynamics. The sound speed in seawater depends on temperature, salinity, and pressure (depth). The empirical equation for sound speed (c) in seawater is given by the Mackenzie equation:\n\nc(T, S, P) = 1449.2 + 4.6T - 0.055T^2 + 0.00029T^3 + (1.34 - 0.01T)(S - 35) + 0.016P\n\nwhere T is the temperature in °C, S is the salinity in parts per thousand, and P is the pressure in decibars (approximately equal to depth in meters).\n\nGiven the temperature (T) of 15°C and salinity (S) of 35 parts per thousand, we can simplify the equation as:\n\nc(T, S, P) = 1449.2 + 4.6(15) - 0.055(15)^2 + 0.00029(15)^3 + (1.34 - 0.01(15))(35 - 35) + 0.016P\n\nc(P) = 1449.2 + 69 - 12.375 + 0.0975 + 0.016P\n\nc(P) = 1505.9225 + 0.016P\n\nNow, to find the maximum depth that a sound wave can travel, we need to consider the depth at which the sound speed is minimum, as sound waves tend to refract towards the region of lower sound speed. This phenomenon is known as the SOFAR (Sound Fixing and Ranging) channel. The minimum sound speed typically occurs at a depth of around 1000 meters in the ocean.\n\nHowever, the given equation does not provide an explicit maximum depth for sound waves. Sound waves can travel thousands of kilometers horizontally in the SOFAR channel, but the vertical depth limit is not explicitly defined. In practice, the maximum depth that a sound wave can travel would be limited by factors such as absorption, scattering, and ambient noise.\n\nIn summary, while the Mackenzie equation provides a relationship between sound speed, temperature, salinity, and pressure, it does not explicitly define a maximum depth for sound wave propagation. The SOFAR channel can guide sound waves horizontally over long distances, but the vertical depth limit would be influenced by other factors."
