    "message_1": "A polarizer is placed in front of a source of unpolarized light. The intensity of the light passing through the polarizer is 2.0 W/m². Another polarizer is placed behind the first polarizer, with its axis turned 30 degrees with respect to the axis of the first polarizer. What is the intensity of the light that passes through the second polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the light that passes through the second polarizer, we can use Malus's Law. Malus's Law states that the intensity of light after passing through a second polarizer is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer, I₀ is the intensity of the light after passing through the first polarizer, and θ is the angle between the axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, I₀ = 2.0 W/m² and θ = 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can apply Malus's Law:\n\nI = 2.0 * cos²(π/6)\nI = 2.0 * (cos(π/6))^2\nI = 2.0 * (0.866)^2\nI ≈ 2.0 * 0.750\nI ≈ 1.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light that passes through the second polarizer is approximately 1.5 W/m²."
