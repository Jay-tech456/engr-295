An observer on Earth sees that the spaceship has just passed by a star located at a distance of 12 light-years from Earth. How much time has passed on the spaceship when it has passed the star from the perspective of someone on the spaceship? Use Lorentz transformations of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Lorentz transformation equations for time dilation and length contraction. The Lorentz factor (γ) is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8 c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8 c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, let's find the contracted distance (D') from the perspective of someone on the spaceship using the length contraction formula:\n\nD' = D / γ\n\nwhere D is the distance between Earth and the star (12 light-years).\n\nD' = 12 light-years / 1.667\nD' ≈ 7.2 light-years\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for the spaceship to travel this contracted distance (t') using the formula:\n\nt' = D' / v\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8 c).\n\nt' = 7.2 light-years / 0.8 c\nt' ≈ 9 years\n\nSo, from the perspective of someone on the spaceship, approximately 9 years have passed when the spaceship has passed the star."
