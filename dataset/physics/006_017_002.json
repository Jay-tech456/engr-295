    "message_2": "The energy difference between the two allowed electron spin states in a hydrogen atom subjected to a magnetic field can be calculated using the electron spin resonance (ESR) effect. The energy difference (ΔE) is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = g * μ_B * B\n\nwhere g is the electron g-factor (approximately 2 for a free electron), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T), and B is the magnetic field strength (9.4 T in this case).\n\nΔE = 2 * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T) * 9.4 T\n\nΔE ≈ 1.74 × 10^-22 J\n\nSo, the energy difference between the two allowed electron spin states in a hydrogen atom when subjected to a magnetic field of 9.4 Tesla is approximately 1.74 × 10^-22 Joules."
