    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine structure splitting in the 5P3/2 level of rubidium-87 due to the interaction with its nuclear spin, we need to consider the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions. However, for the 5P3/2 level, the electric quadrupole interaction is negligible, so we only need to consider the magnetic dipole interaction.\n\nThe hyperfine structure splitting can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = A * F(F + 1) - I(I + 1) - J(J + 1),\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy splitting, A is the magnetic dipole constant, F is the total angular momentum quantum number, I is the nuclear spin quantum number, and J is the electronic angular momentum quantum number.\n\nFor rubidium-87, the nuclear spin quantum number I = 3/2, and for the 5P3/2 level, the electronic angular momentum quantum number J = 3/2. The magnetic dipole constant A for rubidium-87 in the 5P3/2 level is approximately 25 MHz.\n\nNow we need to calculate the energy splitting for each possible value of F. Since F = |I - J|, |I - J + 1|, ..., |I + J - 1|, |I + J|, the possible values of F are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nFor F = 0:\nΔE(0) = 0 (F = 0 is not allowed since |I - J| = 1)\n\nFor F = 1:\nΔE(1) = A * [1(1 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1)] = 25 MHz * [-1] = -25 MHz\n\nFor F = 2:\nΔE(2) = A * [2(2 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1)] = 25 MHz * [3] = 75 MHz\n\nFor F = 3:\nΔE(3) = A * [3(3 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1) - 3/2(3/2 + 1)] = 25 MHz * [7] = 175 MHz\n\nSo, the hyperfine structure splitting in the 5P3/2 level of rubidium-87 due to the interaction with its nuclear spin is -25 MHz, 75 MHz, and 175 MHz for F = 1, 2, and 3, respectively."
