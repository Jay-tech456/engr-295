The alpha particles have an energy of 5.5 MeV and the source is shielded by a 2 mm thick aluminum sheet. The specific alpha-particle emission rate is 12 particles per decay.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of alpha particles emitted per second. Since the source emits at a rate of 3.7 MBq (mega becquerels), we can convert this to decays per second:\n\n3.7 MBq * 10^6 Bq/MBq = 3.7 * 10^6 decays/s\n\nNow, we need to find the number of alpha particles emitted per second. Since there are 12 alpha particles emitted per decay, we can multiply the decay rate by the specific alpha-particle emission rate:\n\n(3.7 * 10^6 decays/s) * 12 particles/decay = 44.4 * 10^6 particles/s\n\nNext, we need to find the energy deposited by the alpha particles. Since the energy of each alpha particle is 5.5 MeV (million electron volts), we can convert this to joules:\n\n5.5 MeV * 1.602 * 10^-13 J/MeV = 8.811 * 10^-13 J\n\nNow, we can find the total energy deposited per second by multiplying the number of alpha particles emitted per second by the energy per alpha particle:\n\n(44.4 * 10^6 particles/s) * (8.811 * 10^-13 J/particle) = 3.912 * 10^-5 J/s\n\nSince the source is shielded by a 2 mm thick aluminum sheet, the alpha particles will lose energy as they pass through the sheet. However, alpha particles have a very short range in matter and will be stopped by the aluminum sheet. Therefore, the dose equivalent rate at a distance of 1 meter from the source will be negligible.\n\nIn conclusion, the dose equivalent rate in nSv/h at a distance of 1 meter from the point source of alpha particles shielded by a 2 mm thick aluminum sheet is effectively 0 nSv/h."
