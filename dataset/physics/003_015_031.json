    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the current element, θ is the angle between the current element and the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and r is the distance between the current element and the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment at the center of the loop, then multiply the result by 4 since the magnetic field due to each segment is the same.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is equal to the side of the square, which is 0.3 m. The distance from the center of the segment to the center of the square loop is half the length of the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr = √((0.3/2)² + (0.3/2)²) = √(0.045 + 0.045) = √0.09 = 0.3 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to one segment at the center of the loop. Since the current is flowing parallel to the segment, the angle θ is 90 degrees, and sinθ = 1. We can now use the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nFor one segment:\n\ndB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * 0.3 m) / (4 * π * 0.3² m²)\ndB₁ = (4.8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.09\ndB₁ = 5.33 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince there are four segments, the total magnetic field at the center of the square loop is:\n\nB = 4 * dB₁\nB = 4 * 5.33 × 10^(-6) T\nB ≈ 2.13 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 2.13 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
