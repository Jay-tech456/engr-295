    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime plays a significant role in determining the orbital trajectory of a planet around a star. According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, massive objects like stars cause the spacetime around them to curve. This curvature of spacetime is what we perceive as gravity.\n\nA planet orbits a star due to the gravitational attraction between the two objects. In the curved spacetime around the star, the planet follows a path called a geodesic, which is the shortest path between two points in the curved spacetime. This geodesic is equivalent to the straight-line path that the planet would follow in the absence of gravity in a flat spacetime.\n\nFor a planet orbiting a star, the geodesic is an elliptical orbit, with the star at one of the foci of the ellipse. This is a result of the inverse-square law of gravity, which states that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nThe curvature of spacetime also causes the planet's orbit to exhibit certain phenomena that cannot be explained by Newtonian gravity alone. One such phenomenon is the precession of the perihelion, which is the gradual rotation of the orbit's major axis. This effect was first observed in the orbit of Mercury and was later explained by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nIn summary, the curvature of spacetime caused by a massive object like a star determines the orbital trajectory of a planet around it. The planet follows a geodesic path in the curved spacetime, resulting in an elliptical orbit with the star at one of the foci. The curvature of spacetime also gives rise to phenomena like the precession of the perihelion, which cannot be explained by Newtonian gravity alone."
