    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a heavy charged lepton, with a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c². It has a very short lifetime of about 2.9 x 10⁻¹³ seconds, which means it decays quickly into other particles. The primary decay modes of the tau lepton can be classified into two categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic Decays:\nIn leptonic decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (either an electron or a muon) and two neutrinos. The leptonic decay modes are:\n\na) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into an electron, an electron neutrino, and a tau antineutrino.\n\nb) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̅_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into a muon, a muon neutrino, and a tau antineutrino.\n\n2. Hadronic Decays:\nIn hadronic decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes can be further divided into one-prong and three-prong decays.\n\na) One-prong decays:\nThese decays involve the production of a single charged hadron (usually a charged pion or kaon) and a tau neutrino. Some examples are:\n\ni) τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into a negatively charged pion and a tau neutrino.\n\nii) τ⁻ → K⁻ + ν_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into a negatively charged kaon and a tau neutrino.\n\nb) Three-prong decays:\nThese decays involve the production of three charged hadrons (usually pions) and a tau neutrino. Some examples are:\n\ni) τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁰ + π⁻ + ν_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into two negatively charged pions, a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino.\n\nii) τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁻ + π⁺ + ν_τ\nIn this decay mode, the tau lepton decays into two negatively charged pions, a positively charged pion, and a tau neutrino.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many possible decay modes of the tau lepton. In general, the tau lepton can decay into a variety of hadronic final states, with the conservation of energy, momentum, and other quantum numbers."
