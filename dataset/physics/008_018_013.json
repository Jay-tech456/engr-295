    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong nuclear force responsible for binding quarks and gluons together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. The experimental approach used to measure the strong coupling constant in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is based on the analysis of high-energy scattering processes involving quarks and gluons, known as hard scattering processes.\n\nTheoretical basis for this approach:\n\nThe theoretical basis for measuring αs at the LHC is rooted in perturbative QCD (pQCD), which is an approximation technique that allows the calculation of scattering amplitudes and cross-sections for hard scattering processes involving quarks and gluons. In pQCD, the strong coupling constant αs is treated as a small parameter, and the calculations are performed as a power series expansion in αs. The validity of this approach relies on the fact that αs decreases with increasing energy scales (or decreasing distances) due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.\n\nSeveral observables are sensitive to the value of αs and can be used to extract its value from experimental data. Some of these observables include:\n\n1. Inclusive jet cross-sections: In high-energy proton-proton collisions, quarks and gluons can be scattered at large angles, producing collimated sprays of hadrons called jets. The production rate of these jets, as a function of their transverse momentum and rapidity, can be calculated using pQCD and compared to experimental measurements to extract αs.\n\n2. Dijet production: Similarly, the production rate of pairs of jets (dijets) can be calculated using pQCD and compared to experimental data to determine αs.\n\n3. Event shapes: Certain global properties of the final state particles in high-energy collisions, such as their distribution in momentum space, can be used to define event shape variables that are sensitive to αs. By comparing the distribution of these variables in experimental data to pQCD calculations, the value of αs can be extracted.\n\nKey challenges in obtaining an accurate measurement:\n\n1. Theoretical uncertainties: The pQCD calculations involve several approximations, such as truncating the power series expansion in αs and using parton distribution functions (PDFs) to describe the initial state of the colliding protons. These approximations introduce uncertainties in the theoretical predictions, which propagate to the extracted value of αs.\n\n2. Experimental uncertainties: The experimental measurements of jet cross-sections, dijet production, and event shapes are subject to various sources of uncertainties, such as detector resolution, background contamination, and systematic effects. These uncertainties need to be carefully estimated and propagated to the final measurement of αs.\n\n3. Non-perturbative effects: At low energy scales (or large distances), the strong coupling constant becomes large, and the pQCD approach becomes unreliable. In this regime, non-perturbative QCD effects, such as hadronization and color reconnection, can significantly affect the observables used to extract αs. These effects need to be modeled and accounted for in the analysis.\n\nIn summary, the experimental approach to measure the strong coupling constant in proton-proton collisions at the LHC relies on the analysis of hard scattering processes involving quarks and gluons, using the framework of perturbative QCD. The key challenges in obtaining an accurate measurement of αs include theoretical uncertainties, experimental uncertainties, and non-perturbative effects."
