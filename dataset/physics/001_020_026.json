    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a photon with a given frequency, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\nIn this case, the frequency (f) is given as 6.0 x 10^14 Hz. Plugging this value into the equation, we get:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (6.0 x 10^14 Hz)\n\nE â‰ˆ 3.98 x 10^-19 Joules\n\nAccording to quantum electrodynamics and renormalization theory, the energy of a photon with a frequency of 6.0 x 10^14 Hz in vacuum is approximately 3.98 x 10^-19 Joules."
