    "message_1": "What is the expected gravitational wave frequency emitted when two black holes with masses of 30 and 40 times that of the sun merge together? Assume that the final black hole has a mass of 65 times that of the sun and that the merger happens at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected gravitational wave frequency emitted during the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the total mass of the two black holes.\n\nGiven the masses of the two black holes (30 and 40 times the mass of the sun), we first need to find the total mass M in kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = (30 + 40) * (1.989 x 10^30 kg)\nM = 70 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg)\nM = 1.3923 x 10^32 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 (gravitational constant)\n\nf = ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^3) / ((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.3923 x 10^32 kg) * π)\nf ≈ 1.24 x 10^-3 Hz\n\nSo, the expected gravitational wave frequency emitted during the merger of the two black holes is approximately 1.24 x 10^-3 Hz."
