    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Here are some key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, unseen dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, like galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These maps reveal that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in specific proportions.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of the universe's evolution, including the effects of dark matter, produce structures that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies.\n\nSeveral candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed beyond the standard model of particle physics. Some of the most popular candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through gravity and the weak nuclear force. They are considered one of the leading dark matter candidates due to their ability to naturally explain the observed relic density of dark matter in the universe.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical low-mass particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are also considered a viable dark matter candidate due to their weak interactions with ordinary matter and their potential to be produced in large quantities in the early universe.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrino flavors. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the dark matter content.\n\n4. Primordial black holes: These are black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. While not a particle, primordial black holes could still contribute to the dark matter content of the universe.\n\nIt is important to note that, despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct detection of dark matter particles has been made yet. The search for dark matter continues to be a major focus in the fields of astrophysics and particle physics."
