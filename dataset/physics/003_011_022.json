    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of a homogeneously current-carrying disc of radius R carrying a current of I, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the disc is homogeneously carrying current, the current density J (current per unit area) is given by:\n\nJ = I / (πR²)\n\nNow, let's consider a small ring of radius ρ and thickness dρ on the disc. The area of this ring is dA = 2πρdρ, and the current flowing through this ring is dI = J * dA = (I / (πR²)) * 2πρdρ.\n\nThe magnetic field due to this small ring at a distance z above the center of the disc can be found by integrating the Biot-Savart Law over the ring. The magnetic field dB due to a small section of the ring of length dl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field along the z-axis, we can consider only the z-component of the magnetic field, dBz. Due to symmetry, the x and y components of the magnetic field will cancel out. The z-component of the magnetic field due to the small section of the ring is:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * z) / r³\n\nIntegrating dBz over the entire ring, we get:\n\nBz_ring = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * z) / r³\n\nNow, we need to integrate Bz_ring over the entire disc (from ρ = 0 to ρ = R) to find the total magnetic field at a distance z above the center of the disc:\n\nBz_total = ∫[∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * z) / r³]\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals, we get:\n\nBz_total = (μ₀ * I * z) / (2 * π * R²) * (1 - z / sqrt(z² + R²))\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of a homogeneously current-carrying disc of radius R carrying a current of I is:\n\nBz_total = (μ₀ * I * z) / (2 * π * R²) * (1 - z / sqrt(z² + R²))"
