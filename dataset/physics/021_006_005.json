    "message_2": "The gravitational force of a black hole affects the orbit of a nearby star or planet in several ways. The primary effect is that the black hole's gravity will cause the nearby object to follow a curved path, which can be described by the laws of general relativity. The curvature of this path depends on the mass of the black hole, the distance between the black hole and the nearby object, and the velocity of the object.\n\nThere are several factors that determine if the object will be captured by the black hole or continue in its orbit:\n\n1. Mass of the black hole: The more massive the black hole, the stronger its gravitational pull. This means that a more massive black hole is more likely to capture a nearby object.\n\n2. Distance between the black hole and the object: The closer an object is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational force it experiences. If the object is too close, it may be unable to maintain a stable orbit and will be captured by the black hole.\n\n3. Velocity of the object: The object's velocity plays a crucial role in determining its fate. If the object is moving too slowly, it will be unable to escape the black hole's gravitational pull and will be captured. On the other hand, if the object is moving fast enough, it can maintain a stable orbit or even escape the black hole's gravity.\n\n4. Initial trajectory of the object: The path that the object takes as it approaches the black hole will also determine its fate. If the object is on a direct collision course with the black hole, it will be captured. However, if the object is on a trajectory that allows it to pass by the black hole at a safe distance, it may continue in its orbit or be deflected onto a new path.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational force of a black hole affects the orbit of nearby objects by causing them to follow curved paths. The fate of these objects, whether they are captured by the black hole or continue in their orbits, depends on factors such as the mass of the black hole, the distance between the black hole and the object, the object's velocity, and its initial trajectory."
