    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I) divided by the length of the loop (2πr). \n\nThe formula for Ampere's Law is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nwhere:\nB = magnetic field\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current = 2 A\nr = radius of the loop = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
