    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the system after the collision, we first need to determine the energy of each particle before the collision. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the moving particle (particle 1) with rest mass 1.5 GeV/c² and speed 0.9c.\n\nWe can use the relativistic equation for momentum:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor particle 1:\nm1 = 1.5 GeV/c²\nv1 = 0.9c\n\np1 = (1.5 GeV/c²)(0.9c) / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)²/c²)\np1 = 1.35 GeV/c / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\np1 = 1.35 GeV/c / sqrt(0.19)\np1 ≈ 3.098 GeV/c\n\nNow we can find the energy of particle 1 using the energy-momentum equation:\n\nE1² = (m1c²)² + (p1c)²\nE1² = (1.5 GeV)² + (3.098 GeV)²\nE1² = 2.25 GeV² + 9.5956 GeV²\nE1² ≈ 11.8456 GeV²\nE1 ≈ 3.44 GeV\n\nNow let's find the energy of the stationary particle (particle 2) with rest mass 2 GeV/c².\n\nSince particle 2 is stationary, its momentum is 0, and its energy is simply its rest mass energy:\n\nE2 = m2c²\nE2 = 2 GeV\n\nNow we can find the total energy of the system after the collision by adding the energies of both particles:\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 3.44 GeV + 2 GeV\nE_total ≈ 5.44 GeV\n\nSo the total energy of the system after the collision is approximately 5.44 GeV."
