    "message_2": "The expected signal of dark matter particles in the gamma-ray spectrum using the indirect detection method primarily depends on the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles into Standard Model particles, which subsequently produce gamma rays. These gamma rays can then be detected by space-based or ground-based observatories, such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) or the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\n\nThe expected signal can be characterized by the following features:\n\n1. Spatial distribution: The gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation or decay is expected to be more prominent in regions with higher dark matter density, such as the Galactic Center or nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n\n2. Energy spectrum: The energy spectrum of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation or decay is expected to have a specific shape, depending on the mass of the dark matter particle and the annihilation or decay channels. Generally, the spectrum would show a cutoff at the mass of the dark matter particle and a continuum below that energy.\n\n3. Angular distribution: The gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation or decay is expected to have a specific angular distribution, which depends on the dark matter density profile in the target region.\n\nTo distinguish the dark matter signal from the background noise, one needs to carefully analyze the data and compare the observed gamma-ray distribution with the expected signal from dark matter and other astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnants, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei. This can be achieved by using advanced statistical methods and modeling techniques to identify any excess gamma-ray emission that cannot be explained by known astrophysical sources or instrumental backgrounds.\n\nMoreover, the detection of a dark matter signal in multiple targets (e.g., the Galactic Center and several dwarf galaxies) or through different channels (e.g., gamma rays and neutrinos) would increase the confidence in the dark matter interpretation of the observed signal.\n\nIn summary, the expected signal of dark matter particles in the gamma-ray spectrum using the indirect detection method depends on the dark matter properties and the target region. Distinguishing this signal from the background noise requires careful data analysis, modeling of astrophysical sources, and, ideally, the detection of a consistent signal in multiple targets or channels."
