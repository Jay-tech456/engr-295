    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. It is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a star with a mass of 10 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^31 kg)) / (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11) * (1.989 × 10^31)) / (9.00 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (2.653 × 10^20) / (9.00 × 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 2.948 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a star with a mass of 10 solar masses as it undergoes gravitational collapse is approximately 2,948 meters or 2.948 kilometers."
