    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron penetrating a potential barrier, we can use the quantum mechanical phenomenon known as \"tunneling.\" In this case, we will use the one-dimensional rectangular potential barrier model. The transmission probability (T) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))\n\nwhere:\n- V₀ is the height of the potential barrier\n- E is the energy of the electron\n- a is the width of the potential barrier\n- k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier, which can be calculated as k2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V₀ - E) / ħ^2), where m is the mass of the electron and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nIn this problem, the energy of the electron (E) is equal to the barrier height (V₀). Therefore, we can simplify the formula as follows:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * V₀ * (V₀ - V₀)))\n\nSince E = V₀, the denominator in the second term becomes zero, making the entire second term undefined. However, we can analyze the limit as E approaches V₀:\n\nlim (E -> V₀) T = 1 / (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))\n\nAs E approaches V₀, the term (V₀ - E) approaches zero, and the term sinh^2(k2 * a) approaches infinity. This results in an indeterminate form of the type 0/0. To resolve this, we can use L'Hôpital's rule, which states that if the limit of the ratio of two functions is of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞, then the limit of their derivatives with respect to the variable (in this case, E) is the same.\n\nTaking the derivative of both the numerator and denominator with respect to E, we get:\n\nd(T)/d(E) = (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E^2)\n\nNow, as E approaches V₀, the limit becomes:\n\nlim (E -> V₀) d(T)/d(E) = (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * V₀^2)\n\nThe V₀^2 terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nT = sinh^2(k2 * a) / 4\n\nThis is the probability of an electron with energy equal to the barrier height penetrating the potential barrier in an atom. Note that the actual value of T depends on the width of the potential barrier (a) and the wave vector inside the barrier (k2)."
