    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (∆G) for the denaturation of the protein, we can use the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆G is the change in free energy, ∆H is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 37°C + 273.15\nT(K) = 310.15 K\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\n∆G = (100 kJ/mol) - (310.15 K) * (200 J/K/mol)\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we need to convert the enthalpy change to J/mol:\n\n∆G = (100,000 J/mol) - (310.15 K) * (200 J/K/mol)\n\nNow we can calculate the change in free energy:\n\n∆G = 100,000 J/mol - (62,030 J/mol)\n∆G = 37,970 J/mol\n\nThe change in free energy (∆G) required for the denaturation of the specific protein at a temperature of 37°C is approximately 37,970 J/mol."
