    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers is given by the formula:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the axes of the polarizers.\n\nFirst, let's find the intensity of light after passing through the first polarizer. Since the polarizer absorbs 50% of the light perpendicular to its axis, it will transmit 50% of the incident light:\n\nI₁ = 12 W/m² * 0.5 = 6 W/m²\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the intensity of light transmitted through the second polarizer. The angle between the axes of the polarizers is 45 degrees:\n\nI = I₁ * cos²(45°)\n\nConvert the angle to radians:\n\n45° * (π/180) = 0.7854 radians\n\nNow, calculate the cosine squared of the angle:\n\ncos²(0.7854) = 0.5\n\nFinally, multiply the intensity after the first polarizer by the cosine squared of the angle:\n\nI = 6 W/m² * 0.5 = 3 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of light transmitted through the two polarizers is 3 W/m²."
