    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula. Unfortunately, I cannot draw a ray diagram here, but I can guide you through the process.\n\n1. Lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n   Where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\n2. Magnification formula: M = -v/u\n   Where M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nGiven, focal length (f) = 10 cm and object distance (u) = -15 cm (negative sign indicates the object is on the left side of the lens).\n\nNow, let's find the image distance (v) using the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/15\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 30\n1/v = 5/30\nv = 30/5\nv = 6 cm\n\nThe positive value of v indicates that the image is formed on the right side of the lens.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -6 / (-15)\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification is 2/5, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive and the magnification is positive, the image formed is real and inverted. In a ray diagram, you would see the image formed on the opposite side of the lens from the object, and it would be smaller and upside down compared to the object."
