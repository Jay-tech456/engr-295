    "message_2": "To find the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of a rubidium-87 atom confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap, we can use the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state, 1 for the first excited state, etc.), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the trap (100 Hz in this case).\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n = 0):\n\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_0 = (1/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (100 Hz)\nE_0 = 3.313 x 10^-33 J\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the first excited state (n = 1):\n\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_1 = (3/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (100 Hz)\nE_1 = 9.939 x 10^-33 J\n\nNow, we can find the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state:\n\nΔE = E_1 - E_0\nΔE = 9.939 x 10^-33 J - 3.313 x 10^-33 J\nΔE = 6.626 x 10^-33 J\n\nSo, the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of a rubidium-87 atom confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap of frequency 100 Hz is approximately 6.626 x 10^-33 joules."
