    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of an excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can use the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, which is related to the transition rate between energy levels. The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is given as 10.2 eV.\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy difference to joules:\n10.2 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV = 1.63422 × 10^(-18) J\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of the emitted photon when the electron transitions from the excited state to the ground state. We can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nWhere E is the energy difference, h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), and f is the frequency.\n\nRearranging for frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (1.63422 × 10^(-18) J) / (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) = 2.466 × 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we can use the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, A:\n\nA = (64 * π^4 * f^3) / (3 * h * c^3)\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nA = (64 * π^4 * (2.466 × 10^15 Hz)^3) / (3 * 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^3) = 4.577 × 10^8 s^(-1)\n\nFinally, the lifetime τ of the excited state is the inverse of the Einstein coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A = 1 / (4.577 × 10^8 s^(-1)) = 2.183 × 10^(-9) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state in a hydrogen atom with an energy of 10.2 eV is approximately 2.183 nanoseconds."
