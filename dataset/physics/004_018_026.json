    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift of light, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = GM/c^2R\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the celestial body, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the radius of the celestial body.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nInitial wavelength, λ = 500 nm = 500 x 10^-9 m\nRadius, R = 10,000 km = 10,000 x 10^3 m = 10^7 m\nMass, M = 5 x 10^28 kg\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)(5 x 10^28 kg) / ((3 x 10^8 m/s)^2(10^7 m))\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.674 x 10^-11)(5 x 10^28) / (9 x 10^16)(10^7)\n\nΔλ/λ = 3.337 x 10^18 / 9 x 10^23\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 3.707 x 10^-6\n\nNow, we can find the change in wavelength, Δλ:\n\nΔλ = λ(Δλ/λ) = (500 x 10^-9 m)(3.707 x 10^-6)\n\nΔλ ≈ 1.8535 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the gravitational redshift of light with a wavelength of 500 nm when it is emitted from a point near the surface of a massive celestial body with a radius of 10,000 km and a mass of 5 x 10^28 kg is approximately 1.8535 x 10^-12 m."
