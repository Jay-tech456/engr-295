    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear radius of an alpha particle, we can use the empirical formula for the nuclear radius, which is given by:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the nuclear radius, R₀ is a constant (approximately 1.2 fm, where fm stands for femtometers or 10^(-15) meters), and A is the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) of the nucleus.\n\nFor an alpha particle, there are 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so the mass number A = 2 + 2 = 4. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nR = 1.2 fm * 4^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.2 fm * 1.587\nR ≈ 1.9 fm\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of an alpha particle is approximately 1.9 fm.\n\nNow, let's compare the radius of an alpha particle to the radius of a typical nucleus. A typical nucleus has a mass number A, which is larger than 4 (the mass number of an alpha particle). Using the same formula, we can write the radius of a typical nucleus as:\n\nR_typical = R₀ * A_typical^(1/3)\n\nTo compare the two radii, we can take the ratio:\n\nR_typical / R_alpha = (R₀ * A_typical^(1/3)) / (R₀ * 4^(1/3))\n\nNotice that R₀ cancels out:\n\nR_typical / R_alpha = A_typical^(1/3) / 4^(1/3)\n\nSince A_typical > 4, the ratio R_typical / R_alpha > 1, which means that the radius of a typical nucleus is larger than the radius of an alpha particle.\n\nIn conclusion, the nuclear radius of an alpha particle is approximately 1.9 fm, and the radius of a typical nucleus is larger than that of an alpha particle. The mathematical justification for this comparison is based on the empirical formula for nuclear radius and the fact that the mass number of a typical nucleus is larger than that of an alpha particle."
