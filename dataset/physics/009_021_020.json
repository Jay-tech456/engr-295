    "message_2": "When a linearly polarized light passes through a polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the angle between the axis of polarization of the incident light and the axis of the polarizer. This relationship is described by Malus' Law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and theta is the angle between the axis of polarization of the incident light and the axis of polarization of the polarizer.\n\nGiven that the angle between the axis of polarization of the incident light and the axis of polarization of the polarizer is 30 degrees, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(30Â°)\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * (sqrt(3)/2)^2\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * (3/4)\n\nThe maximum intensity of the transmitted light occurs when the angle between the axis of polarization of the incident light and the axis of polarization of the polarizer is 0 degrees (i.e., they are parallel). In this case, the transmitted intensity is equal to the incident intensity:\n\nI_max = I_incident\n\nThe minimum intensity of the transmitted light occurs when the angle between the axis of polarization of the incident light and the axis of polarization of the polarizer is 90 degrees (i.e., they are perpendicular). In this case, no light is transmitted:\n\nI_min = 0\n\nSo, the maximum intensity of the transmitted light is I_incident, and the minimum intensity is 0. For the given angle of 30 degrees, the transmitted intensity is (3/4) * I_incident."
