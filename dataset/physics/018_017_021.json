    "message_2": "Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter that is believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was extremely hot and dense. In this state, quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons, are no longer confined within individual particles but instead move freely in a \"soup\" of strongly interacting matter. This state of matter is characterized by several unique properties, which are related to the fundamental interactions of subatomic particles.\n\n1. High temperature and energy density: QGP is formed at extremely high temperatures, typically above 2 trillion Kelvin (about 100,000 times hotter than the core of the Sun) and at energy densities much higher than those found in ordinary matter. These extreme conditions are necessary to overcome the strong force that binds quarks and gluons together inside protons and neutrons.\n\n2. Deconfinement: In QGP, quarks and gluons are no longer confined within individual particles, as they are in ordinary matter. Instead, they move freely throughout the plasma, interacting strongly with one another. This deconfinement is a direct result of the strong force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, which is responsible for holding quarks and gluons together inside protons and neutrons.\n\n3. Chiral symmetry restoration: In QGP, the chiral symmetry of the underlying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theory is restored. This means that left-handed and right-handed quarks become equivalent in this state, unlike in ordinary matter where they have different properties due to the strong force. This symmetry restoration is related to the strong force and is a key feature of QGP.\n\n4. Color deconfinement: In QGP, the color charge of quarks and gluons, which is the source of the strong force, is no longer confined within individual particles. Instead, the color charge is spread throughout the plasma, leading to a state of matter that is both color-neutral and color-deconfined. This property is directly related to the strong force and is another distinguishing feature of QGP.\n\n5. Relativistic fluid: QGP behaves like a nearly perfect fluid with very low viscosity, meaning that it flows with minimal resistance. This property is related to the strong force, which causes the quarks and gluons in the plasma to interact strongly and collectively, leading to the fluid-like behavior.\n\nIn summary, the properties of quark-gluon plasma are closely related to the fundamental interactions of subatomic particles, particularly the strong force. The extreme conditions required to create QGP result in the deconfinement of quarks and gluons, the restoration of chiral symmetry, color deconfinement, and the formation of a nearly perfect relativistic fluid. These properties provide valuable insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions and the fundamental forces that govern the behavior of subatomic particles."
