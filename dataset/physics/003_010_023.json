    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field strength (B) inside a cylinder carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * μr * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB = magnetic field strength\nμ₀ = permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nμr = relative permeability of the material\nI = current (2.5 A)\nr = distance from the center of the cylinder (0.03 m)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the permeability of the material (μ) using the relative permeability (μr):\n\nμ = μ₀ * μr\nμ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 1200\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength (B) at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the cylinder:\n\nB = (μ * I) / (2 * π * r)\nB = ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 1200 * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB ≈ 0.0006283 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the cylinder is approximately 0.0006283 Tesla."
