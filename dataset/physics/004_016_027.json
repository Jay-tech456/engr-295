    "message_2": "In the framework of General Relativity, the presence of dark energy significantly affects the expansion rate of the universe. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a negative pressure, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.\n\nThe expansion of the universe is described by the Friedmann equations, which are derived from Einstein's field equations of General Relativity. These equations relate the expansion rate (Hubble parameter) to the energy content of the universe, including dark energy.\n\nDark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant (denoted by Î›) or as a scalar field with an equation of state parameter w (the ratio of pressure to energy density). The cosmological constant model corresponds to w = -1, while other models of dark energy can have different values of w.\n\nThe presence of dark energy in the Friedmann equations leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe. This acceleration is due to the negative pressure exerted by dark energy, which counteracts the attractive force of gravity from matter (both ordinary and dark matter) in the universe.\n\nThe exact effect of dark energy on the expansion rate depends on the amount of dark energy present and its equation of state parameter w. Observations of distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and the large-scale structure of the universe suggest that dark energy makes up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe, with w close to -1.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark energy in the framework of General Relativity causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate due to its negative pressure. The exact effect on the expansion rate depends on the properties of dark energy, but current observations suggest that it makes up a significant portion of the universe's energy content and has a near-constant equation of state parameter."
