    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the gravitational waves produced by the collapse of a star, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Amplitude (h): h ~ (G * M * c) / (r * c^2)\n2. Frequency (f): f ~ (c^3) / (G * M)\n3. Wavelength (λ): λ = c / f\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the collapsing star (20 solar masses), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and r is the distance from the source of the gravitational waves.\n\nHowever, we need to know the distance r from the source of the gravitational waves to calculate the amplitude. Since this information is not provided, we cannot calculate the amplitude.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency and wavelength of the gravitational waves:\n\n1. Frequency (f): f ~ (c^3) / (G * M)\n   M = 20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\n   f ~ (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 3.978 x 10^31 kg)\n   f ~ 1.34 x 10^3 Hz\n\n2. Wavelength (λ): λ = c / f\n   λ = (2.998 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.34 x 10^3 Hz)\n   λ ~ 2.24 x 10^5 m\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the collapse of a star with a mass of 20 solar masses is approximately 1.34 x 10^3 Hz, and the wavelength is approximately 2.24 x 10^5 meters. However, we cannot calculate the amplitude without knowing the distance from the source of the gravitational waves."
