    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure at the bottom of the tank, we can use the following formula:\n\nPressure (P) = Density (ρ) × Acceleration due to gravity (g) × Height (h)\n\nGiven:\nDensity of water (ρ) = 1000 kg/m³\nAcceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s²\nHeight of water in the tank (h) = 2.5 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = ρ × g × h\nP = 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² × 2.5 m\n\nP = 24525 kg m/s² m²\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m/s² m², the pressure at the bottom of the tank is:\n\nP = 24525 Pa"
