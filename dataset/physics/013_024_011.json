    "message_2": "The maximum safe exposure limit of cosmic rays for astronauts during a manned mission to Mars is determined by the guidelines set by various space agencies, such as NASA and ESA. These guidelines are based on the potential health risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, including the increased risk of cancer and other long-term health effects.\n\nNASA has established a career limit for astronauts' radiation exposure, which is based on age, gender, and other factors. The limit is expressed in units of Sievert (Sv), which is a measure of the biological effect of ionizing radiation. For a typical astronaut, the career limit ranges from 1 to 4 Sieverts, depending on age and gender.\n\nDuring a manned mission to Mars, astronauts would be exposed to cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originating from outside our solar system. The exposure to cosmic rays would be higher than in low Earth orbit due to the lack of Earth's protective magnetic field and atmosphere. It is estimated that a round-trip mission to Mars would expose astronauts to approximately 0.3 to 0.6 Sieverts of radiation, which is a significant portion of their career limit.\n\nTo minimize the risks associated with cosmic ray exposure, mission planners would need to consider factors such as mission duration, spacecraft shielding, and the solar cycle. The solar cycle affects the intensity of cosmic rays, with lower levels during solar maximum and higher levels during solar minimum. Additionally, advanced radiation shielding materials and technologies are being researched to further reduce the exposure to cosmic rays during manned missions to Mars and other deep space destinations."
