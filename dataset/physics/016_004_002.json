    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor is the temperature below which the material transitions from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state, where it can conduct electrical current with zero resistance. The application of an external magnetic field can affect the critical temperature and the superconducting properties of the material.\n\nWhen a superconductor is subjected to an external magnetic field, the magnetic field penetrates the material up to a certain depth, known as the penetration depth. However, beyond this depth, the magnetic field is expelled from the superconductor due to the Meissner effect. The ability of a superconductor to expel the magnetic field decreases as the temperature approaches the critical temperature (Tc).\n\nAs the external magnetic field increases, the critical temperature of the superconductor decreases. This relationship is described by the critical magnetic field (Hc) or the upper critical field (Hc2) for type-II superconductors. The critical magnetic field is the maximum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand while maintaining its superconducting state. When the applied magnetic field exceeds the critical magnetic field, the superconductor transitions back to the normal conducting state, losing its zero resistance property.\n\nFor type-I superconductors, the transition from the superconducting state to the normal state is abrupt when the critical magnetic field is reached. In contrast, type-II superconductors exhibit a mixed state (also called the vortex state) between the lower critical field (Hc1) and the upper critical field (Hc2). In this mixed state, magnetic vortices penetrate the superconductor, allowing some magnetic flux to pass through while still maintaining partial superconductivity.\n\nIn summary, the application of an external magnetic field affects the critical temperature of a superconductor by decreasing it, and it can also influence the superconductor's ability to conduct electrical current with zero resistance. When the applied magnetic field exceeds the critical magnetic field, the superconductor loses its superconducting properties and transitions back to the normal conducting state."
