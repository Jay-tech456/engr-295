    "message_2": "To find the kinetic energy of the particle, we first need to determine its relativistic mass. The relativistic mass (m) can be found using the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass (1.67 x 10^-27 kg), v is the velocity (0.8c), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can find the value of 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNext, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.36) = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / 0.6 = 2.7833 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow that we have the relativistic mass, we can find the kinetic energy (K) using the equation:\n\nK = (m - m0)c^2\n\nK = (2.7833 x 10^-27 kg - 1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nK = (1.1133 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nK = 1.00197 x 10^-10 J\n\nThe particle's kinetic energy is approximately 1.00 x 10^-10 Joules."
