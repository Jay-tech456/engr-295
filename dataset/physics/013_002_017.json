    "message_2": "The mass range for stars that undergo a Type II supernova is typically between 8 and 50 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). Stars in this mass range are massive enough to undergo nuclear fusion of elements beyond helium, leading to the production of heavy elements through nucleosynthesis.\n\nDuring their lifetimes, these massive stars go through several stages of nuclear fusion, starting with hydrogen fusion into helium, followed by helium fusion into carbon and oxygen, and then further fusion of heavier elements up to iron. However, the fusion of elements with atomic masses higher than iron requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, so the process stops at iron.\n\nWhen the core of the star is composed mostly of iron, it can no longer generate energy through fusion, and the core collapses under its own gravity. This leads to a rebound effect, creating a shockwave that propagates through the outer layers of the star and results in a Type II supernova explosion.\n\nDuring the supernova explosion, the outer layers of the star are ejected into space, and the conditions of extremely high temperature and pressure enable the production of heavy elements beyond iron through a process called rapid neutron capture, or the r-process. This process involves the rapid capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei, leading to the formation of heavy, neutron-rich isotopes that eventually decay into stable heavy elements.\n\nIn summary, the mass range for stars that undergo a Type II supernova (8 to 50 solar masses) is directly related to the production of heavy elements through nucleosynthesis, as these massive stars are capable of undergoing nuclear fusion of elements beyond helium and provide the necessary conditions for the formation of heavy elements during the supernova explosion."
