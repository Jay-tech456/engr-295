    "message_2": "To find the specific enthalpy of the steam-water mixture, we need to determine the specific enthalpy of both the steam and liquid water components and then calculate the weighted average based on their mass fractions.\n\nFirst, let's find the specific enthalpy of the liquid water (hf) and the steam (hg) at 125°C. We can use the steam tables for this purpose. For the given temperature, we have:\n\nhf (125°C) ≈ 523.7 kJ/kg\nhg (125°C) ≈ 2745.6 kJ/kg\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the steam and liquid water components in the mixture:\n\nmass of steam (ms) = 20% of 5 kg = 0.2 * 5 kg = 1 kg\nmass of liquid water (mw) = 80% of 5 kg = 0.8 * 5 kg = 4 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the specific enthalpy of the mixture (hmix) using the weighted average:\n\nhmix = (ms * hg + mw * hf) / (ms + mw)\nhmix = (1 kg * 2745.6 kJ/kg + 4 kg * 523.7 kJ/kg) / (1 kg + 4 kg)\nhmix = (2745.6 kJ + 2094.8 kJ) / 5 kg\nhmix = 4840.4 kJ / 5 kg\nhmix ≈ 968.08 kJ/kg\n\nSo, the specific enthalpy of the steam-water mixture is approximately 968.08 kJ/kg."
