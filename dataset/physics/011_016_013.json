    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the material, we can use the Curie-Weiss law, which states:\n\nχ = (C / (T - θ)) * (μ₀ * H)\n\nwhere:\n- C is the Curie constant\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (K)\n- θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature (assumed to be 0 K for paramagnetic materials)\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T m/A)\n- H is the applied magnetic field in Tesla (T)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Curie constant (C). The Curie constant is given by:\n\nC = (N * μ²) / (3 * k_B)\n\nwhere:\n- N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume\n- μ is the magnetic moment in Bohr magnetons (1 Bohr magneton = 9.274 × 10^(-24) Am²)\n- k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10^(-23) J/K)\n\nTo find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (N), we can use the following equation:\n\nN = (ρ * N_A) / M\n\nwhere:\n- ρ is the density of the material in g/cm³ (1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³)\n- N_A is the Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^(23) mol^(-1))\n- M is the molar mass of the material in g/mol\n\nSince we don't have the molar mass of the material, we can't calculate the exact value of N. However, we can express the magnetic susceptibility in terms of N:\n\nχ = (N * μ² * μ₀ * H) / (3 * k_B * T)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nμ = 2.5 Bohr magnetons = 2.5 * 9.274 × 10^(-24) Am² = 2.3185 × 10^(-23) Am²\nρ = 8.9 g/cm³ = 8.9 * 1000 kg/m³ = 8900 kg/m³\nT = 300 K\nH = 0.5 T\n\nχ = (N * (2.3185 × 10^(-23) Am²)² * (4π × 10^(-7) T m/A) * 0.5 T) / (3 * (1.381 × 10^(-23) J/K) * 300 K)\n\nχ = (N * (5.374 × 10^(-46) A²m²) * (6.283 × 10^(-7) T² m/A)) / (1.2438 × 10^(-22) J)\n\nχ = (N * 3.376 × 10^(-52) A²m³T²) / (1.2438 × 10^(-22) J)\n\nχ = 2.715 × 10^(-30) N A²m³T²/J\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the material is 2.715 × 10^(-30) N A²m³T²/J, where N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume. To find the exact value of χ, we would need the molar mass of the material."
