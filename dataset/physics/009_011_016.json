    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance and magnification of the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nFor a concave lens, the focal length is negative. In this case, the focal length (f) is -20 cm, and the object distance (u) is -40 cm (object distance is always negative).\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/(-40)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-20) + 1/(-40)\n1/v = (-2 + 1) / 40\n1/v = -1/40\n\nSo, v = -40 cm (negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object).\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = v/u\n\nM = (-40)/(-40)\nM = 1\n\nThe magnification of the lens is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object.\n\nSo, the image distance is 40 cm, and the magnification is 1."
