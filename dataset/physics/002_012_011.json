    "message_2": "To calculate the isothermal work done by the gas during the expansion, we can use the formula for isothermal work:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)), T is the temperature, Vi is the initial volume, and Vf is the final volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nRearranging for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (1.5 × 10⁵ Pa)(0.2 m³) / (8.314 J/(mol·K))(300 K)\n\nn ≈ 12.04 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the work done during the isothermal expansion. The final volume is double the initial volume, so Vf = 2 * Vi = 0.4 m³.\n\nW = (12.04 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(300 K) * ln(0.4 m³ / 0.2 m³)\n\nW ≈ (12.04 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(300 K) * ln(2)\n\nW ≈ 30,037.92 J * 0.6931\n\nW ≈ 20,809.97 J\n\nSo the isothermal work done by the gas during the expansion is approximately 20,810 J."
