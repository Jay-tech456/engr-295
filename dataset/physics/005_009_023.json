Calculate the frequency of the sound heard by a stationary observer on Earth, given the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s. (Hint: Use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for moving Observer)",
    "message_2": "The relativistic Doppler effect formula for a moving observer is given by:\n\nf_observed = f_source * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed by the stationary observer on Earth, f_source is the frequency emitted by the spaceship (500 Hz), β is the ratio of the spaceship's speed to the speed of light (v/c), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nIn this case, the spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.6c, so β = 0.6.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nf_observed = 500 Hz * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\nf_observed = 500 Hz * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\nf_observed = 500 Hz * sqrt(4)\n\nf_observed = 500 Hz * 2 = 1000 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the sound heard by a stationary observer on Earth is 1000 Hz. Note that this calculation assumes that the sound waves can propagate through the vacuum of space, which is not the case in reality. However, this answer is based on the given problem statement."
