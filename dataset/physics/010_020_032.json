    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the apparent viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid using a Couette viscometer. The fluid exhibits a shear thinning behavior, and the student is given the following data: the gap distance of the viscometer is 0.2 cm, the inner radius of the outer cylinder is 4.0 cm, the length of the inner cylinder is 10 cm, and the rotational speed of the outer cylinder is 500 rpm. The student is also given the torque measured by the viscometer, which is 0.3 Nm. Calculate the apparent viscosity of the fluid at the given shear rate.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the apparent viscosity of the fluid, we first need to determine the shear rate and shear stress.\n\n1. Calculate the angular velocity (ω) of the outer cylinder:\n\nω = 2π × (rotational speed) = 2π × (500 rpm) = 1000π rad/min\n\nConvert to rad/s:\n\nω = (1000π rad/min) × (1 min/60 s) = 100π/3 rad/s\n\n2. Calculate the shear rate (γ):\n\nγ = (ω × gap distance) / (inner radius of the outer cylinder) = (100π/3 rad/s × 0.2 cm) / 4.0 cm\n\nγ = 50π/3 s^(-1)\n\n3. Calculate the shear stress (τ):\n\nτ = torque / (2π × inner radius of the outer cylinder × length of the inner cylinder) = 0.3 Nm / (2π × 0.04 m × 0.1 m)\n\nτ = 0.3 Nm / (0.02512 m^2) = 11.95 N/m^2\n\n4. Calculate the apparent viscosity (η):\n\nη = τ / γ = (11.95 N/m^2) / (50π/3 s^(-1))\n\nη ≈ 0.228 Pa·s\n\nThe apparent viscosity of the fluid at the given shear rate is approximately 0.228 Pa·s."
