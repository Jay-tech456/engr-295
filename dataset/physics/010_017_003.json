    "message_1": "A cylinder of diameter 0.1m is immersed in water flowing at a velocity of 2m/s. If the natural frequency of the cylinder vibration is 10 Hz and the damping coefficient is 0.1, find the amplitude of cylinder vibration when it is subjected to a fluid-structure interaction.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the cylinder vibration when subjected to fluid-structure interaction, we can use the formula for the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator subjected to a sinusoidal force:\n\nA = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nwhere:\nA is the amplitude of the vibration\nF0 is the force amplitude\nk is the spring constant\nm is the mass of the cylinder\nω is the angular frequency (2π times the natural frequency)\nc is the damping coefficient\n\nFirst, we need to find the force amplitude (F0) acting on the cylinder due to the fluid flow. We can use the drag force equation:\n\nF0 = 0.5 * ρ * v^2 * A * Cd\n\nwhere:\nρ is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m³)\nv is the flow velocity (2 m/s)\nA is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (π * (d/2)^2, where d is the diameter)\nCd is the drag coefficient (assuming a value of 1 for a cylinder)\n\nF0 = 0.5 * 1000 * (2)^2 * (π * (0.1/2)^2) * 1\nF0 ≈ 15.71 N\n\nNext, we need to find the mass (m) of the cylinder. Assuming the cylinder is made of steel with a density of 7850 kg/m³ and has a length (L) of 1 m:\n\nVolume = π * (d/2)^2 * L\nm = Volume * density_steel\n\nm = π * (0.1/2)^2 * 1 * 7850\nm ≈ 61.57 kg\n\nNow, we can find the spring constant (k) using the natural frequency (f) formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * sqrt(k / m)\nk = (2πf)^2 * m\n\nk = (2π * 10)^2 * 61.57\nk ≈ 242664.6 N/m\n\nFinally, we can find the amplitude (A) using the formula mentioned earlier:\n\nω = 2π * 10 = 62.83 rad/s\n\nA = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\nA = 15.71 / sqrt((242664.6 - 61.57 * (62.83)^2)^2 + (0.1 * 62.83)^2)\nA ≈ 0.0012 m\n\nThe amplitude of the cylinder vibration when subjected to fluid-structure interaction is approximately 0.0012 meters or 1.2 mm."
