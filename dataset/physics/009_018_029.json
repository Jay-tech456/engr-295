    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the wavelength of light used in a double-slit experiment. Given that the distance between the slits is 0.25 mm and the distance from the slits to the screen is 1.5 m, and that the first-order bright fringe is observed at an angle of 15 degrees from the central maximum. What is the wavelength of the light used in the experiment?",
    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength of the light used in the double-slit experiment, we can use the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the bright fringe from the central maximum, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first-order bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Distance between the slits (d) = 0.25 mm = 0.25 * 10^(-3) m\n- Distance from the slits to the screen (L) = 1.5 m\n- Angle of the first-order bright fringe (θ) = 15 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (in radians) = (15 * π) / 180 ≈ 0.2618 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the given values into the formula:\n\nsin(0.2618) = (1 * λ) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\n\nTo solve for λ, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (0.25 * 10^(-3)):\n\nλ = sin(0.2618) * (0.25 * 10^(-3))\n\nλ ≈ 0.0000656 m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers, we can multiply by 10^9:\n\nλ ≈ 65.6 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the light used in the double-slit experiment is approximately 65.6 nm."
