    "message_2": "To determine the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a point 0.3 m above the center of the sheet, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the sheet is rectangular and the current is uniformly distributed, we can simplify the problem by considering the magnetic field produced by two long straight wires carrying the same current, one at each side of the sheet.\n\nThe magnetic field produced by a long straight wire carrying a current I at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nFor our problem, we have two wires carrying a current of 2.5 A each, located at a distance of 0.2 m from the center of the sheet (half the width of the sheet). The point we want to find the magnetic field at is 0.3 m above the center of the sheet.\n\nLet's first find the magnetic field produced by one wire:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.3 m) = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.3 = 8.33 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane formed by the wire and the point, the magnetic field produced by the other wire will have the same magnitude but opposite direction. Therefore, the total magnetic field at the point will be the vector sum of the two magnetic fields.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the total magnetic field:\n\nB_total = √(B₁^2 + B₂^2) = √(8.33 × 10^(-6) T)^2 + (8.33 × 10^(-6) T)^2 = 11.78 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane formed by the two wires and the point, which is parallel to the longer side of the sheet.\n\nSo, the strength of the magnetic field at a point 0.3 m above the center of the sheet is 11.78 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is parallel to the longer side of the sheet."
