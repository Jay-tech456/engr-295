    "message_2": "Cavitation occurs when the pressure in a liquid drops below its vapor pressure. The vapor pressure of water at 20°C is given as 2339 Pa. Therefore, the minimum pressure required to initiate cavitation in water at 20°C is equal to its vapor pressure, which is 2339 Pa.\n\nNow, let's find the vapor pressure of water at 30°C. You can use the Antoine equation to determine the vapor pressure at different temperatures:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere P is the vapor pressure, T is the temperature in Celsius, and A, B, and C are constants specific to the substance. For water, the constants are:\n\nA = 8.07131\nB = 1730.63\nC = 233.426\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for 30°C:\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / (30 + 233.426))\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / 263.426)\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - 6.57356\nlog10(P) = 1.49775\n\nNow, let's find the vapor pressure P:\n\nP = 10^1.49775\nP ≈ 3169.6 Pa\n\nSo, the minimum pressure required to initiate cavitation in water at 30°C is approximately 3169.6 Pa."
