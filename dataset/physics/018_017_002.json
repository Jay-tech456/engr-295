    "message_2": "Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter in which quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons, are no longer confined within individual particles but instead move freely in a hot and dense medium. This state is believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang and can be recreated in high-energy particle collisions, such as those in heavy-ion colliders.\n\nProperties and behavior of quarks and gluons in the quark-gluon plasma state:\n\n1. Deconfinement: In the QGP state, quarks and gluons are no longer confined within individual hadrons (protons, neutrons, etc.). They can move freely within the plasma, interacting with each other over a range of distances.\n\n2. Asymptotic freedom: As the energy scale or temperature of the system increases, the strong force between quarks and gluons becomes weaker. This property, known as asymptotic freedom, allows quarks and gluons to behave almost like free particles at very high energies or temperatures.\n\n3. Chiral symmetry restoration: In the QGP state, the chiral symmetry of the underlying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theory is restored. This means that the distinction between left- and right-handed quarks becomes irrelevant, and the masses of quarks become negligible compared to their energies.\n\n4. Color screening: Due to the high density of color charges in the QGP, the effective range of the strong force between quarks and gluons is reduced. This phenomenon, known as color screening, prevents the formation of color singlet states, which are necessary for the confinement of quarks and gluons within hadrons.\n\n5. High temperature and energy density: The QGP state is characterized by extremely high temperatures (on the order of trillions of degrees Celsius) and energy densities, much higher than those found in ordinary matter.\n\nProperties and behavior of quarks and gluons in a confined state:\n\n1. Confinement: In a confined state, quarks and gluons are bound within individual hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. They cannot move freely and are restricted to a limited range of distances within the hadron.\n\n2. Strong force: In the confined state, the strong force between quarks and gluons is much stronger than in the QGP state. This force is responsible for binding quarks and gluons together within hadrons.\n\n3. Chiral symmetry breaking: In the confined state, the chiral symmetry of QCD is broken, leading to the generation of quark masses and the distinction between left- and right-handed quarks.\n\n4. Color confinement: In the confined state, quarks and gluons are always found in color singlet states, meaning that their net color charge is zero. This is a result of the strong force, which confines quarks and gluons within hadrons.\n\n5. Lower temperature and energy density: The confined state is characterized by much lower temperatures and energy densities compared to the QGP state.\n\nIn summary, the properties and behavior of quarks and gluons in the quark-gluon plasma state differ significantly from those in a confined state. In the QGP state, quarks and gluons are deconfined, exhibit asymptotic freedom, and experience chiral symmetry restoration and color screening. In contrast, in the confined state, quarks and gluons are bound within hadrons, experience a strong force, and exhibit chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement."
