    "message_2": "To find the width of the single slit, we can use the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first-order bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nWe are given:\nθ = 30 degrees\nm = 1 (first-order bright fringe)\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\n\nWe need to find the width of the slit (a). First, let's convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for a:\n\na = (m * λ) / sin(θ)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\na = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9) m) / sin(π / 6)\na ≈ (650 * 10^(-9) m) / 0.5\na ≈ 1300 * 10^(-9) m\n\nConverting back to nanometers:\n\na ≈ 1300 nm\n\nSo, the width of the single slit is approximately 1300 nm."
