    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point outside a sphere carrying a current I uniformly distributed along its surface, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nConsider a point P outside the sphere at a distance r from the center of the sphere (where r > R). To apply Ampere's Law, we choose an Amperian loop in the shape of a circle with radius r centered at the sphere and lying in a plane perpendicular to the radial direction.\n\nSince the magnetic field is radially symmetric, the magnetic field B will be tangent to the Amperian loop at every point. Thus, the dot product B⋅dl becomes B*dl, and the line integral becomes:\n\n∮B dl = B * 2πr\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the Amperian loop. The total current on the sphere is I, and it is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere. The surface area of the sphere is 4πR². Therefore, the current density (J) on the sphere is:\n\nJ = I / (4πR²)\n\nThe Amperian loop encloses the entire sphere, so the enclosed current (I_enclosed) is equal to the total current I. Applying Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a point outside a sphere of radius R that carries a current I uniformly distributed along its surface."
