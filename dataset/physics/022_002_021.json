    "message_2": "The current estimate for the abundance of dark matter in the observable universe is that it makes up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content. This estimate is based on several lines of evidence, including:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB, particularly the anisotropies (tiny temperature fluctuations), have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The distribution of these anisotropies is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n2. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation show that the observed large-scale structures can only form if dark matter is present to provide the necessary gravitational force.\n\n3. Gravitational lensing: When light from distant galaxies passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the light is bent. This bending of light, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations of gravitational lensing have revealed the presence of large amounts of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n4. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars and gas in galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass of the galaxy. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat, indicating the presence of additional, unseen mass in the form of dark matter.\n\n5. The Bullet Cluster: This is a famous example of a galaxy cluster collision, where the hot gas (visible through X-ray observations) and the majority of the mass (inferred through gravitational lensing) are spatially separated. This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the majority of the mass is not associated with the visible gas.\n\nThese lines of evidence, along with others, have led to the current estimate that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the observable universe."
