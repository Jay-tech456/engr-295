    "message_2": "Topological insulators (TIs) are a unique class of materials that exhibit insulating behavior in their bulk but have conducting surface states. These surface states are protected by the topological properties of the material, which makes them robust against impurities and defects. The transport properties of topological insulators, such as electrical and thermal conductivity, are fundamentally different from those in conventional materials due to the presence of these topologically protected surface states.\n\n1. Electrical conductivity: In conventional materials, electrical conductivity is determined by the movement of charge carriers (electrons and holes) within the material. In topological insulators, the bulk of the material is insulating, so the electrical conductivity is primarily due to the surface states. These surface states are characterized by a linear dispersion relation, which leads to massless Dirac fermions as charge carriers. The spin of these fermions is locked to their momentum, resulting in a helical spin texture. This spin-momentum locking makes backscattering of electrons highly unlikely, leading to a robust and highly conductive surface state that is immune to non-magnetic impurities and defects.\n\n2. Thermal conductivity: In conventional materials, thermal conductivity is governed by the transport of phonons (lattice vibrations) and electrons. In topological insulators, the bulk thermal conductivity is mainly due to phonons, as the bulk is insulating. However, the surface states contribute to the thermal conductivity as well. The massless Dirac fermions in the surface states have a high mobility, which enhances the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. Additionally, the spin-momentum locking can also affect the phonon scattering at the surface, potentially leading to anisotropic thermal conductivity.\n\n3. Thermoelectric properties: Topological insulators have attracted interest for their potential thermoelectric applications due to the coexistence of high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric efficiency of a material is determined by its Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. In TIs, the high electrical conductivity of the surface states combined with the low thermal conductivity of the bulk can lead to a high thermoelectric efficiency.\n\n4. Other transport properties: Topological insulators can also exhibit unique transport properties due to their topological nature, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the spin Hall effect. These effects arise from the interplay between the topological surface states and the external magnetic field or spin-orbit coupling, respectively.\n\nIn summary, the transport properties of topological insulators are fundamentally different from those in conventional materials due to the presence of topologically protected surface states. These surface states give rise to unique and robust transport properties, such as high electrical conductivity, anisotropic thermal conductivity, and enhanced thermoelectric efficiency, which make topological insulators promising candidates for various applications in electronics and energy conversion."
