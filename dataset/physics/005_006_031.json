    "message_1": "What is the shift in wavelength of light emitted from the surface of a planet with a gravitational acceleration of 10 m/s² compared to the wavelength of the same light when it is observed by someone very far from the planet? (Assume that the planet has a radius of 5000 km and a mass of 5x10²⁴kg, and the observer is at a distance of 100,000 km from the surface of the planet.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the gravitational redshift formula, which is derived from the general theory of relativity. The formula is:\n\nΔλ/λ = (ΔΦ/c²)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔΦ is the difference in gravitational potential between the two points, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3x10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in gravitational potential (ΔΦ) between the surface of the planet and the observer's location. The gravitational potential at a distance r from a mass M is given by:\n\nΦ = -GM/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674x10^-11 m³/kg/s²).\n\nFor the surface of the planet (r1 = 5000 km = 5x10^6 m):\n\nΦ1 = -G(M/r1) = -(6.674x10^-11)(5x10^24)/(5x10^6) = -6.674x10^13 J/kg\n\nFor the observer's location (r2 = 100,000 km = 1x10^8 m):\n\nΦ2 = -G(M/r2) = -(6.674x10^-11)(5x10^24)/(1x10^8) = -3.337x10^13 J/kg\n\nNow we can find the difference in gravitational potential:\n\nΔΦ = Φ2 - Φ1 = -3.337x10^13 - (-6.674x10^13) = 3.337x10^13 J/kg\n\nNow we can use the gravitational redshift formula to find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ/λ = (ΔΦ/c²) = (3.337x10^13)/(9x10^16) = 3.707x10^-4\n\nTo find the actual shift in wavelength (Δλ), we need to know the initial wavelength (λ). However, since the problem does not provide this information, we can only express the shift in terms of the initial wavelength:\n\nΔλ = λ(3.707x10^-4)\n\nSo the shift in wavelength of the light emitted from the surface of the planet compared to the wavelength observed by someone very far from the planet is 3.707x10^-4 times the initial wavelength."
