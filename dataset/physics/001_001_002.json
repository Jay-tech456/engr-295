    "message_2": "The time-independent Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the stationary states of a quantum system. It is given by:\n\nHψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian operator, ψ(x) is the wave function of the system, and E is the energy eigenvalue. For a single particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian operator is given by:\n\nH = -(ħ^2 / 2m) (d^2 / dx^2) + V(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and V(x) is the potential energy function.\n\nNow, let's consider a particle in an infinite square well potential. The potential energy function V(x) is defined as:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < a\nV(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ a\n\nwhere a is the width of the well. Since the potential is infinite outside the well, the wave function must be zero in those regions. Inside the well, the potential is zero, so the time-independent Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = Eψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation. The general solution is given by:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(a) = 0, we get:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(a) = A sin(ka) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero), we must have sin(ka) = 0. This implies that:\n\nka = nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Therefore, the allowed wave numbers k and the corresponding energy eigenvalues E are:\n\nk_n = nπ / a\nE_n = (ħ^2 k_n^2) / (2m) = (n^2 π^2 ħ^2) / (2m a^2)\n\nThe normalized wave functions for the particle in the infinite square well are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nThese wave functions and energy eigenvalues represent the stationary states of the particle in the infinite square well potential."
