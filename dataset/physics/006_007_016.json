    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, the energy required for a helium atom to excite the first excited state can be determined by measuring the potential difference at which inelastic collisions between electrons and helium atoms occur. This potential difference corresponds to the energy required to excite the helium atom from its ground state to the first excited state.\n\nThe energy required for this transition can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = eV\n\nwhere E is the energy, e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), and V is the potential difference.\n\nFor helium, the potential difference required for the first excited state is approximately 19.8 V. Therefore, the energy required for this transition is:\n\nE = (1.602 x 10^-19 C) x (19.8 V) â‰ˆ 3.17 x 10^-18 J\n\nThe significance of this finding lies in the fact that it provides experimental evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms. The Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates that atoms can only absorb energy in discrete amounts, corresponding to the differences between their energy levels. This supports the idea that the energy levels in atoms are quantized, meaning that they can only take on specific, discrete values.\n\nThe quantization of energy levels in atoms is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and is crucial for understanding atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in atoms. This concept helps explain phenomena such as the emission and absorption spectra of atoms, as well as the stability of atoms and the formation of chemical bonds. The Franck-Hertz experiment played a significant role in the development of quantum mechanics by providing experimental evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms."
