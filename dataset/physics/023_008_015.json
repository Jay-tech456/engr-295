    "message_2": "In quantum teleportation, a two-qubit system can be used to teleport one qubit of information. A qubit (quantum bit) is the fundamental unit of quantum information, and it can exist in a superposition of states, unlike classical bits which can only be in one of two states (0 or 1). This means that a qubit can represent more information than a classical bit.\n\nIn classical teleportation, using two classical bits, you can only represent and transmit one of four possible states (00, 01, 10, or 11). In contrast, a two-qubit system can represent a continuous range of states due to the superposition principle, allowing for the teleportation of one qubit of information.\n\nTo provide a numerical comparison, we can use the concept of Shannon entropy, which measures the amount of information contained in a system. For a classical bit, the maximum Shannon entropy is 1 bit, while for a qubit, the maximum von Neumann entropy (analogous to Shannon entropy in quantum systems) is log2(2) = 1 qubit.\n\nIn summary, using quantum teleportation with a two-qubit system, you can teleport one qubit of information, which is equivalent to the maximum information content of a classical two-bit system. However, the quantum system has the advantage of representing a continuous range of states, allowing for more efficient and secure communication in certain applications."
