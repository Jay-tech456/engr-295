    "message_1": "What is the energy range of gamma rays detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and how does it contribute to our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as pulsars and active galactic nuclei?",
    "message_2": "The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, is designed to detect gamma rays in the energy range of about 20 MeV to over 300 GeV (1 MeV = 10^6 electron volts, and 1 GeV = 10^9 electron volts). This wide energy range allows the telescope to observe various high-energy astrophysical phenomena, including pulsars and active galactic nuclei (AGN).\n\nPulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, including gamma rays. By detecting gamma rays from pulsars, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope helps scientists study the pulsar's emission mechanisms, magnetic field structure, and particle acceleration processes. This information, in turn, contributes to our understanding of the life cycle of stars and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are the central regions of galaxies that emit enormous amounts of energy, primarily in the form of gamma rays. This energy is believed to be generated by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's observations of AGN provide insights into the processes that occur near black holes, the role of AGN in galaxy evolution, and the nature of cosmic gamma-ray background radiation.\n\nIn summary, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's ability to detect gamma rays in a wide energy range significantly contributes to our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as pulsars and active galactic nuclei. The data collected by the telescope helps scientists investigate the underlying physical processes, the behavior of matter in extreme environments, and the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole."
