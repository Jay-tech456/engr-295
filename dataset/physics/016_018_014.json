    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconducting wire made of niobium-titanium (NbTi) alloy is around 9-10 Kelvin (K). This is the temperature below which the material becomes superconducting and exhibits zero electrical resistance.\n\nThe wire's diameter has a negligible effect on its Tc value for bulk materials. However, when the diameter of the wire becomes extremely small, approaching the nanoscale, the Tc value may be affected due to the increased influence of surface effects and boundary conditions. In general, for practical applications and macroscopic wire sizes, the diameter of the niobium-titanium wire does not significantly impact the critical temperature."
