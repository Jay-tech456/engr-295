    "message_2": "To determine the polarization state of the light after passing through the polarizing filter, we can use Malus' Law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light (θ_i) and the transmission axis of the polarizing filter (θ_t).\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(θ_i - θ_t)\n\nIn this case, the angle of incidence (θ_i) is 60 degrees, and the angle of the transmission axis (θ_t) is 30 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizing filter is:\n\nθ = θ_i - θ_t = 60 - 30 = 30 degrees\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(30)\n\nSince we are only interested in the polarization state of the light, we can ignore the intensity factor (I_i) and focus on the polarization angle:\n\nPolarization angle = 30 degrees\n\nSo, the polarization state of the light after passing through the polarizing filter is 30 degrees with respect to the vertical."
