    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop of wire, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current flowing through the wire (2 A), and r is the radius of the loop (0.1 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at the center of the circular loop of wire is 4 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
