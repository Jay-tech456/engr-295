    "message_2": "The polarization pattern of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of a binary black hole system can be described in terms of two independent polarizations: the \"plus\" polarization (h+) and the \"cross\" polarization (hx). These polarizations are named after their shapes, which resemble a plus sign and a cross, respectively. The overall polarization pattern depends on the orientation of the binary system with respect to the observer and the distance from the observer.\n\nAt different distances from the observer, the amplitude of the gravitational waves will change, but the overall pattern of the polarizations will remain the same. The amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases as the distance from the observer increases, following an inverse relationship. Specifically, the amplitude is proportional to 1/distance.\n\nAs the observer moves farther away from the binary black hole system, the gravitational waves will become weaker, but the polarization pattern will still consist of the plus and cross polarizations. The relative strength of these polarizations depends on the inclination angle between the observer and the orbital plane of the binary system.\n\nIn summary, the polarization pattern of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of a binary black hole system consists of plus and cross polarizations. The amplitude of these polarizations decreases with increasing distance from the observer, but the overall pattern remains the same. The relative strength of the polarizations depends on the orientation of the binary system with respect to the observer."
