    "message_2": "To determine the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced during the merger of two black holes, we can use the following information:\n\n1. Masses of the black holes: M1 = 10 solar masses, M2 = 15 solar masses\n2. Distance from us: D = 1 billion light years\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 10 + 15 = 25 solar masses\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (10 * 15) / 25 = 6 solar masses\n\nNext, we need to convert these masses to the SI unit (kilograms) and the distance to meters:\n\nM = 25 * (1.9885 × 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 4.97125 × 10^31 kg\nμ = 6 * (1.9885 × 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 1.1931 × 10^31 kg\nD = 1 billion light years * (9.461 × 10^15 m/light year) = 9.461 × 10^24 m\n\nNow, we can estimate the frequency (f) and amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves during the merger. The frequency of the gravitational waves at the peak of the merger can be approximated using the following formula:\n\nf ≈ (c^3 / G * M) * (π * M * f)^(-2/3)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s) and G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2). However, without knowing the exact frequency (f) at the peak of the merger, we cannot calculate the frequency directly.\n\nAs for the amplitude of the gravitational waves, it can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh ≈ (4 * G * M * c^2) * (π * f * D)^(-1)\n\nAgain, without knowing the exact frequency (f) at the peak of the merger, we cannot calculate the amplitude directly.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced during the merger of two black holes, we need more information about the system, such as the frequency at the peak of the merger. With that information, we can use the formulas provided to estimate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves."
