    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. The evidence for dark matter goes beyond the Standard Model of physics, which describes the behavior of known particles and forces but does not account for dark matter.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to measure the mass of those objects. The observed lensing effects often require more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which would have influenced the formation of cosmic structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\nSeveral experiments are underway to detect and study dark matter directly or indirectly:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to observe the interaction of dark matter particles with ordinary matter. Examples include the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), the XENON experiment, and the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. These experiments use highly sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay. Examples include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), which observes gamma rays from space, and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which detects neutrinos from the Earth's South Pole.\n\n3. Collider experiments: Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in high-energy collisions. By studying the products of these collisions, physicists hope to gain insights into the properties of dark matter.\n\n4. Astrophysical observations: Observations of cosmic structures, such as galaxy clusters and the cosmic web, can provide indirect evidence for dark matter and help constrain its properties. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are examples of projects that aim to study dark matter through astrophysical observations.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for dark matter comes from various astrophysical observations that cannot be explained by the Standard Model of physics alone. Numerous experiments are being conducted to directly or indirectly detect and study dark matter, with the hope of gaining a better understanding of its nature and properties."
