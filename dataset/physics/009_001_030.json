    "message_2": "To determine the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass, respectively), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), and θ1 = 30 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.3333\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 19.47 degrees.\n\nTo find the lateral displacement of the beam as it enters the glass slab, we can use the formula:\n\nlateral displacement = thickness of slab * (tan(θ1) - tan(θ2))\n\nHowever, the thickness of the glass slab is not provided in the problem. If you can provide the thickness of the glass slab, we can calculate the lateral displacement."
