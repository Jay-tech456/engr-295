    "message_2": "In a flat, matter-dominated (Ωm = 1) cosmology, the Friedmann equation can be simplified to:\n\nH^2 = H0^2 * a(t)^(-3)\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, H0 is the Hubble constant, and a(t) is the scale factor at time t.\n\nTo find the age of the universe, we need to integrate the scale factor with respect to time:\n\nt = ∫(1/H) dt = ∫(1/(H0 * a(t)^(-3/2))) da(t)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let x = a(t)^(-3/2), then -2/3 * a(t)^(-5/2) da(t) = dx. The integral becomes:\n\nt = ∫(-2/3 * a(t)^(-5/2) / (H0 * a(t)^(-3/2))) da(t) = (-2/3) * ∫(1/(H0 * x)) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nt = (-2/3) * (1/H0) * ∫(1/x) dx = (-2/3) * (1/H0) * ln(x) + C\n\nTo find the constant of integration C, we can use the fact that at the present time (t0), the scale factor a(t0) = 1. Therefore, x = 1 and t = t0:\n\nt0 = (-2/3) * (1/H0) * ln(1) + C\nt0 = C\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation for the age of the universe as:\n\nt = (-2/3) * (1/H0) * ln(x) + t0\n\nSince we're interested in the age of the universe, we want to find t0. We know that at the present time, a(t0) = 1, so x = 1:\n\nt0 = (-2/3) * (1/H0) * ln(1) + t0\nt0 = 0 + t0\n\nThus, the age of the universe is given by:\n\nt0 = (-2/3) * (1/H0)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc:\n\nt0 = (-2/3) * (1/(70 km/s/Mpc))\n\nTo convert the units from km/s/Mpc to seconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 Mpc ≈ 3.086 × 10^19 km:\n\nt0 = (-2/3) * (1/(70 km/s * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 km)))\nt0 ≈ (-2/3) * (1/(70 s^-1 * (1 / 3.086 × 10^19 s)))\nt0 ≈ (-2/3) * (3.086 × 10^19 / 70) s\nt0 ≈ 8.8 × 10^17 s\n\nTo convert this to years, we can use the conversion factor 1 year ≈ 3.154 × 10^7 s:\n\nt0 ≈ 8.8 × 10^17 s * (1 year / 3.154 × 10^7 s)\nt0 ≈ 2.79 × 10^10 years\n\nSo, the age of the universe in this flat, matter-dominated cosmology with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc is approximately 2.79 × 10^10 years or 27.9 billion years."
