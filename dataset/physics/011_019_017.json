The crystal has a face-centered cubic structure with a lattice parameter of 3.5 Å. Assume that the thermal expansion is isotropic and linear.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the crystal, we can use the formula:\n\nα = (ΔL / L_initial) / ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L_initial is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in length (ΔL):\n\nΔL = L_final - L_initial\nΔL = 20.2 cm - 20 cm\nΔL = 0.2 cm\n\nNow, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C\nΔT = 75°C\n\nNow we can calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α):\n\nα = (ΔL / L_initial) / ΔT\nα = (0.2 cm / 20 cm) / 75°C\nα = (0.01) / 75°C\nα = 1.33 × 10^(-4) °C^(-1)\n\nThe thermal expansion coefficient of the crystal is 1.33 × 10^(-4) °C^(-1)."
