    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section of an electron by a neutral lithium atom, we need to use the Mott formula for the differential cross section:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z * e^2 / (4 * E * sin^2(θ/2)))^2 * (1 - β^2 * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\ndσ/dΩ is the differential cross section\nZ is the atomic number of the target atom (lithium, Z = 3)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nE is the energy of the incident electron (100 keV = 100 x 10^3 eV)\nθ is the scattering angle (45 degrees)\nβ is the velocity of the incident electron divided by the speed of light (v/c)\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity of the incident electron (v) using its energy (E):\n\nE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg). Solving for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * E / m)\n\nNow, we can find β:\n\nβ = v / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nNext, we can plug in all the values into the Mott formula and calculate the differential cross section:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (3 * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (4 * 100 x 10^3 eV * sin^2(45/2)))^2 * (1 - β^2 * sin^2(45/2))\n\nFinally, to find the total Mott scattering cross section, we need to integrate the differential cross section over the solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫∫ dσ/dΩ * sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nHowever, this integral is difficult to solve analytically, and it is usually solved numerically. The total Mott scattering cross section depends on the specific experimental setup and the range of angles considered."
