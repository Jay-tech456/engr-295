    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a top quark decaying into a W boson and a bottom quark, we need to use the electroweak theory, which combines the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. The decay of a top quark into a W boson and a bottom quark is a weak interaction process, and it is the dominant decay mode for the top quark.\n\nThe probability of this decay can be calculated using the Fermi's Golden Rule, which states that the decay rate (Γ) is proportional to the square of the matrix element (|M|²) and the phase space factor (ρ). In this case, the matrix element is related to the electroweak coupling constants and the CKM matrix elements.\n\nFor the decay of a top quark (t) into a W boson (W) and a bottom quark (b), the matrix element can be written as:\n\n|M|² = G_F² |V_tb|² (2π)⁴ δ⁴(p_t - p_W - p_b) × (p_t · p_b) (p_t · p_W)\n\nwhere G_F is the Fermi constant, V_tb is the CKM matrix element for the top-bottom transition, and p_t, p_W, and p_b are the four-momenta of the top quark, W boson, and bottom quark, respectively.\n\nThe phase space factor ρ can be calculated using the two-body decay formula:\n\nρ = (1 / (2π)²) × (1 / 8) × (1 / m_t²) × |p_W| × dΩ\n\nwhere m_t is the mass of the top quark and |p_W| is the magnitude of the momentum of the W boson in the top quark rest frame.\n\nNow, we can calculate the decay rate (Γ) using Fermi's Golden Rule:\n\nΓ = (|M|² × ρ) / ħ\n\nGiven the mass of the top quark (173 GeV/c²), we can calculate the decay rate. However, to find the probability of this decay, we need to compare it to the total decay rate of the top quark (Γ_total). Since the decay into a W boson and a bottom quark is the dominant decay mode, the probability is approximately:\n\nP(t → Wb) ≈ Γ(t → Wb) / Γ_total ≈ 1\n\nSo, the probability of a top quark decaying into a W boson and a bottom quark is approximately 1, or nearly certain. This is consistent with experimental observations, as this decay mode is observed in almost all top quark decays."
