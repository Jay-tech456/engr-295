    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the partial pressure of water vapor and dry air in the container. Then, we will use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of each component and finally, their respective masses and mole fractions.\n\n1. Find the saturation vapor pressure of water at 25°C:\nWe can use the Antoine equation to find the saturation vapor pressure of water at a given temperature. The equation is:\n\nlog10(Psat) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere Psat is the saturation vapor pressure in kPa, T is the temperature in Celsius, and A, B, and C are constants. For water, A = 8.07131, B = 1730.63, and C = 233.426.\n\nAt 25°C:\n\nlog10(Psat) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / (25 + 233.426))\nPsat = 10^(3.1653)\nPsat ≈ 3.17 kPa\n\n2. Find the partial pressure of water vapor (Pw) and dry air (Pa):\nThe relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the actual vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure at the same temperature. So,\n\nPw = RH * Psat\nPw = 0.60 * 3.17 kPa\nPw ≈ 1.90 kPa\n\nSince the total pressure (Ptotal) is the sum of the partial pressures of dry air and water vapor, we can find the partial pressure of dry air (Pa):\n\nPa = Ptotal - Pw\nPa = 101.3 kPa - 1.90 kPa\nPa ≈ 99.4 kPa\n\n3. Use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of water vapor (nw) and dry air (na):\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. We will use the specific gas constant for dry air (Ra = 0.287 kPa m³/kg K) and water vapor (Rw = 0.4615 kPa m³/kg K).\n\nFor dry air:\nPa * V = na * Ra * T\nna = (Pa * V) / (Ra * T)\n\nFor water vapor:\nPw * V = nw * Rw * T\nnw = (Pw * V) / (Rw * T)\n\nFirst, convert the temperature to Kelvin:\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, calculate the number of moles:\nna = (99.4 kPa * 0.5 m³) / (0.287 kPa m³/kg K * 298.15 K) ≈ 1.16 kg\nnw = (1.90 kPa * 0.5 m³) / (0.4615 kPa m³/kg K * 298.15 K) ≈ 0.0068 kg\n\n4. Calculate the mole fractions of dry air (xa) and water vapor (xw):\nThe mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of a component to the total number of moles in the mixture.\n\nxa = na / (na + nw)\nxa = 1.16 kg / (1.16 kg + 0.0068 kg) ≈ 0.994\n\nxw = nw / (na + nw)\nxw = 0.0068 kg / (1.16 kg + 0.0068 kg) ≈ 0.006\n\nSo, the mass of air in the container is approximately 1.16 kg, and the mass of water vapor is approximately 0.0068 kg. The mole fraction of dry air is approximately 0.994, and the mole fraction of water vapor is approximately 0.006."
