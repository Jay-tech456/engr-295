    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the Feynman diagram representing a photon scattering off an electron is called Compton scattering. The diagram consists of two vertices, with an incoming electron (represented by a straight line with an arrow) and an incoming photon (represented by a wavy line) interacting at the first vertex. The electron emits a photon and changes its direction, while the incoming photon is absorbed. At the second vertex, the electron absorbs the emitted photon, and a new photon is emitted in a different direction. The outgoing electron and photon are represented by a straight line with an arrow and a wavy line, respectively.\n\nThe scattering probability, or the amplitude, of this process can be calculated using the Feynman rules for QED. These rules involve associating mathematical expressions with each element of the diagram, such as propagators for internal lines, vertex factors for vertices, and polarization vectors for external photon lines. The amplitude is then obtained by multiplying these expressions and integrating over the internal momenta.\n\nHowever, when calculating the scattering probability, one may encounter divergences, which are infinite values that arise due to the presence of virtual particles with arbitrarily high energies and momenta. Renormalization is a technique used to deal with these divergences and obtain finite, physically meaningful results.\n\nIn renormalization, the divergences are absorbed into the redefinition of the parameters of the theory, such as the electron mass, the electron charge, and the coupling constant. This is done by introducing counterterms in the Lagrangian of the theory, which cancel out the divergences. The renormalized parameters are then expressed in terms of the bare (unrenormalized) parameters and the counterterms.\n\nThe renormalization process involves choosing a renormalization scheme and a renormalization scale, which determine how the divergences are subtracted and how the renormalized parameters depend on the energy scale. One common renormalization scheme is the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, which subtracts only the divergent parts of the loop integrals.\n\nAfter renormalization, the scattering probability can be calculated using the renormalized parameters, and the result will be finite and independent of the regularization and renormalization procedures. The renormalized QED has been shown to provide accurate predictions for various physical processes, such as the electron's magnetic moment and the Lamb shift in atomic spectra."
