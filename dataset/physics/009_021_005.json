    "message_1": "A beam of light traveling in the x-y plane (with electric field oscillations only in the x-y plane) passes through a polarizing filter that is oriented at θ = 30° from the x-axis. The intensity of the transmitted light is measured to be 25% of the original intensity. What is the angle between the electric field of the original light and the transmission axis of the polarizing filter?",
    "message_2": "The intensity of the transmitted light through a polarizing filter can be calculated using Malus' Law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_original * cos^2(α)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the transmitted intensity, I_original is the original intensity, and α is the angle between the electric field of the original light and the transmission axis of the polarizing filter.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the transmitted intensity is 25% of the original intensity:\n\n0.25 * I_original = I_original * cos^2(α)\n\nDivide both sides by I_original:\n\n0.25 = cos^2(α)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.25) = cos(α)\n\n0.5 = cos(α)\n\nNow, find the angle α by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.5:\n\nα = arccos(0.5)\n\nα ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the angle between the electric field of the original light and the transmission axis of the polarizing filter is approximately 60°."
