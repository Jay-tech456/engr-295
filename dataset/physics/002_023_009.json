    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of propane at 25 °C, we can use the Ideal Gas Law equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25 °C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles (n) of propane in the sample. To do this, we can use the molar mass of propane (C3H8), which is approximately 44.1 g/mol.\n\nWe are not given the mass of the propane sample, so we cannot directly calculate the number of moles. However, we can rearrange the Ideal Gas Law equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for P, V, and T, as well as the ideal gas constant R (0.0821 L atm/mol K):\n\nn = (5 atm)(25 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K)(298.15 K)\n\nn ≈ 5.12 moles\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the vapor pressure of propane at 25 °C. The vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the gas when it is in equilibrium with its liquid phase. Since the sample is already in the gas phase and we know its pressure (5 atm), we can assume that the vapor pressure of propane at 25 °C is also 5 atm.\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of propane at 25 °C is approximately 5 atm."
