    "message_2": "To calculate the shear stress at a point 0.05 m from the center of the pipe, we can use the Navier-Stokes equations. However, for this problem, we can simplify the process by using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a circular pipe. The velocity profile for laminar flow in a circular pipe is given by:\n\nv(r) = (ΔP / 4ηL) * (R² - r²)\n\nwhere:\nv(r) = velocity at a radial distance r from the center of the pipe\nΔP = pressure drop across the pipe\nη = dynamic viscosity of the fluid (0.001 Pa·s)\nL = length of the pipe\nR = radius of the pipe (0.1 m)\nr = radial distance from the center of the pipe (0.05 m)\n\nWe are given the maximum velocity (2 m/s) at the center of the pipe (r = 0). So, we can write:\n\n2 = (ΔP / 4ηL) * (R² - 0²)\n\nNow, we can find the shear stress at a point 0.05 m from the center of the pipe using the following equation:\n\nτ(r) = η * (dv/dr)\n\nwhere:\nτ(r) = shear stress at radial distance r from the center of the pipe\ndv/dr = velocity gradient with respect to the radial distance r\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity gradient (dv/dr):\n\ndv/dr = d/dr [(ΔP / 4ηL) * (R² - r²)]\n\ndv/dr = (ΔP / 4ηL) * (-2r)\n\nNow, we can find the shear stress at r = 0.05 m:\n\nτ(0.05) = η * (dv/dr) at r = 0.05 m\n\nτ(0.05) = 0.001 * (ΔP / 4 * 0.001 * L) * (-2 * 0.05)\n\nWe can see that the shear stress depends on the pressure drop (ΔP) and the length of the pipe (L). Without these values, we cannot calculate the exact value of the shear stress. However, we can express the shear stress in terms of ΔP and L:\n\nτ(0.05) = -0.025 * (ΔP / L)"
