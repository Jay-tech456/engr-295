    "message_2": "To calculate the optical bandgap energy of the semiconductor material, we can use the formula:\n\nE_g = (hc) / λ\n\nwhere E_g is the bandgap energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the peak wavelength (650 nm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the peak wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ = 650 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.5 x 10^(-7) m\n\nNow, we can calculate the bandgap energy:\n\nE_g = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.5 x 10^(-7) m)\nE_g = 3.057 x 10^(-19) J\n\nTo express the bandgap energy in electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J\n\nE_g = 3.057 x 10^(-19) J * (1 eV / 1.602 x 10^(-19) J)\nE_g ≈ 1.91 eV\n\nSo, the optical bandgap energy of the semiconductor material is approximately 1.91 eV."
