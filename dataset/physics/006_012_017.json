For a helium atom in its ground state, there are two electrons in the 1s orbital. We can use the formula for the ionization energy of a hydrogen-like atom to calculate the ionization energy of helium:\n\nIonization Energy (IE) = -E_final + E_initial\n\nFor a hydrogen-like atom, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -Z^2 * (13.6 eV) / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (for helium, Z = 2), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor a helium atom in its ground state, the electron is in the 1s orbital, so n = 1. Plugging in the values for Z and n, we get:\n\nE_1 = -2^2 * (13.6 eV) / 1^2\nE_1 = -4 * 13.6 eV\nE_1 = -54.4 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from this energy level to an infinitely separated state (n = âˆž). Therefore, E_final = 0 eV.\n\nIE = -E_final + E_initial\nIE = -0 + (-(-54.4 eV))\nIE = 54.4 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a helium atom in its ground state is 54.4 eV."
