    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of propane gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = n * ΔH_combustion_per_mole\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion, n is the number of moles of propane, and ΔH_combustion_per_mole is the standard enthalpy of combustion for propane.\n\nGiven that the standard enthalpy of combustion for propane is -2220 kJ/mol, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔH_combustion = 2 moles * (-2220 kJ/mol)\n\nΔH_combustion = -4440 kJ\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of propane gas is -4440 kJ."
