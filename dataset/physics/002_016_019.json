    "message_2": "To calculate the critical temperature of the substance, we can use the van der Waals equation of state for real gases. The critical point is defined by the conditions:\n\nPc = (a / (27 * b^2)) * (8 * Tc / (3 * b))\n\nWhere Pc is the critical pressure, Tc is the critical temperature, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nWe are given the values of Pc, a, and b:\n\nPc = 35 atm\na = 3 atm L^2/mol^2\nb = 0.05 L/mol\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for Tc:\n\nTc = (3 * b * Pc) / (8 * a)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nTc = (3 * 0.05 L/mol * 35 atm) / (8 * 3 atm L^2/mol^2)\n\nTc = (0.15 L/mol * 35 atm) / (24 atm L^2/mol^2)\n\nTc = 5.25 L atm / (24 L^2/mol^2)\n\nTc = (5.25 / 24) atm L / (L^2/mol^2)\n\nTc ≈ 0.21875 atm L / (L^2/mol^2)\n\nTo convert the units, we can multiply by the conversion factor (1 mol^2 / 1 atm L):\n\nTc ≈ 0.21875 mol^2 K\n\nThe critical temperature of the substance is approximately 0.21875 mol^2 K."
