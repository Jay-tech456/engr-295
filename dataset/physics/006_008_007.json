    "message_2": "To find the minimum frequency of incident radiation required to eject an electron with a kinetic energy of 1.5 eV from a silver metal surface, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK.E. = h * (f - f0)\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron, h is the Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the incident radiation, and f0 is the threshold frequency of the metal.\n\nFor silver, the work function (Φ) is approximately 4.73 eV. The work function is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from the metal surface and is related to the threshold frequency by the equation:\n\nΦ = h * f0\n\nFirst, we need to convert the kinetic energy from eV to Joules. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J. So, the kinetic energy in Joules is:\n\nK.E. = 1.5 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV = 2.40327 × 10^(-19) J\n\nNow, we can rearrange the photoelectric effect equation to solve for the frequency of the incident radiation:\n\nf = (K.E. / h) + f0\n\nThe Planck's constant (h) is 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js. To find the threshold frequency (f0), we can use the work function:\n\nf0 = Φ / h = (4.73 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV) / (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) = 1.139 × 10^(15) Hz\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation to find the frequency of the incident radiation:\n\nf = (2.40327 × 10^(-19) J / 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) + 1.139 × 10^(15) Hz = 3.625 × 10^(14) Hz + 1.139 × 10^(15) Hz = 1.502 × 10^(15) Hz\n\nSo, the minimum frequency of incident radiation required to eject an electron with a kinetic energy of 1.5 eV from a silver metal surface is approximately 1.502 × 10^(15) Hz."
