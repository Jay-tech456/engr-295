Given that the mass of 2H is 2.014102 u and the mass of 3He is 3.016029 u. Also, assume that the mass of the nucleus of 3He is entirely due to the combined masses of the two nuclei of 2H.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in this nuclear fusion reaction, we need to find the mass defect and then use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, to convert the mass defect into energy.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the combined masses of the two deuterium nuclei and the mass of the helium-3 nucleus.\n\nMass of 2H = 2.014102 u\nMass of 3He = 3.016029 u\n\nCombined mass of two 2H nuclei = 2 * 2.014102 u = 4.028204 u\n\nMass defect = Combined mass of two 2H nuclei - Mass of 3He nucleus\nMass defect = 4.028204 u - 3.016029 u = 1.012175 u\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u is equal to 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 1.012175 u * 1.66053906660 × 10^-27 kg/u = 1.680882 × 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation, E=mc^2, to find the energy released. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (1.680882 × 10^-27 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.680882 × 10^-27 kg * 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.512794 × 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the energy released when two nuclei of deuterium fuse to form a nucleus of helium-3 is approximately 1.512794 × 10^-10 Joules."
