    "message_1": "A small refrigerator has a coefficient of performance of 2.5 when operating between temperatures of 3°C and 15°C. If the refrigerator consumes 500 Joules of energy per second, what is its cooling capacity in kW?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is the ratio of the cooling capacity (Q_c) to the work input (W). In this case, the COP is given as 2.5, and the refrigerator consumes 500 Joules of energy per second (which is equivalent to 500 Watts).\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the cooling capacity (Q_c):\n\nQ_c = COP * W\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nQ_c = 2.5 * 500 W\n\nQ_c = 1250 W\n\nTo convert the cooling capacity to kilowatts (kW), we divide by 1000:\n\nQ_c = 1250 W / 1000\n\nQ_c = 1.25 kW\n\nSo, the cooling capacity of the refrigerator is 1.25 kW."
