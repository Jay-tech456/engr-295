Use the relativistic aberration formula to solve for the angular shift.",
    "message_2": "The relativistic aberration formula is given by:\n\nθ' = arctan[(sinθ) / (γ(cosθ + β))]\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the apparent angle of the distant star as seen by the observer on the spaceship\nθ is the angle between the direction of motion of the spaceship and the line connecting the observer to the distant star (in this case, θ = 90° since the observer is looking perpendicular to the direction of motion)\nβ = v/c is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2) is the Lorentz factor\n\nGiven that the spaceship is traveling at 0.9c, we have:\n\nβ = 0.9\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81) = 1 / sqrt(0.19) ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the relativistic aberration formula:\n\nθ' = arctan[(sin(90°)) / (2.294(cos(90°) + 0.9))]\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1 and cos(90°) = 0, the formula simplifies to:\n\nθ' = arctan[1 / (2.294 * 0.9)]\n\nθ' ≈ arctan[1 / 2.0646] ≈ arctan(0.4843)\n\nUsing a calculator or a trigonometric table, we find:\n\nθ' ≈ 25.84°\n\nSo, the angular shift in the apparent position of the distant star with respect to the nearby star when observed from the spaceship traveling at 0.9c is approximately 25.84°."
