    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is the remnant radiation from the early universe, which provides crucial information about the formation and evolution of the universe. The CMB was formed during the time of decoupling, when the universe cooled down enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This allowed photons to travel freely without being scattered by the plasma of charged particles.\n\nTo calculate the temperature and density of the early universe during the time of decoupling, we can use the following information:\n\n1. The current temperature of the CMB is about 2.725 K.\n2. The redshift (z) at the time of decoupling is approximately 1100.\n\nThe temperature of the universe during decoupling can be calculated using the relation between temperature and redshift:\n\nT_decoupling = T_now * (1 + z)\n\nwhere T_now is the current temperature of the CMB, and z is the redshift.\n\nT_decoupling = 2.725 K * (1 + 1100) = 2.725 K * 1101 ≈ 3000 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the early universe during the time of decoupling was approximately 3000 K.\n\nTo calculate the density of the early universe during decoupling, we can use the critical density formula:\n\nρ_c = 3H^2 / (8πG)\n\nwhere ρ_c is the critical density, H is the Hubble parameter, and G is the gravitational constant. The Hubble parameter can be related to the redshift as:\n\nH(z) = H_0 * sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ)\n\nwhere H_0 is the Hubble constant (approximately 70 km/s/Mpc), Ω_m is the matter density parameter (approximately 0.3), and Ω_Λ is the dark energy density parameter (approximately 0.7).\n\nH_decoupling = H_0 * sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + 1100)^3 + Ω_Λ) ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc * sqrt(0.3 * 1101^3 + 0.7) ≈ 7.2 * 10^4 km/s/Mpc\n\nNow we can calculate the critical density at decoupling:\n\nρ_c_decoupling = 3 * (7.2 * 10^4 km/s/Mpc)^2 / (8π * 6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2)\n\nρ_c_decoupling ≈ 4.15 * 10^-16 kg/m^3\n\nSo, the density of the early universe during the time of decoupling was approximately 4.15 * 10^-16 kg/m^3.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation provides crucial information about the early universe. During the time of decoupling, when photons were able to travel freely without being scattered by the plasma of charged particles, the temperature of the universe was approximately 3000 K, and the density was approximately 4.15 * 10^-16 kg/m^3."
