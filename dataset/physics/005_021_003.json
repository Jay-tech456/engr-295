    "message_1": "A charged particle is moving at a speed of 0.8c in a vacuum towards a stationary observer. The observer measures the distance between successive crests of the electromagnetic wave associated with the particle (spark radiation) to be 10 cm. What is the frequency of the radiation as measured by the observer?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for electromagnetic waves. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nThe Doppler effect formula for electromagnetic waves is:\n\nf_obs = f_src * (c + v_obs) / (c + v_src)\n\nwhere f_obs is the observed frequency, f_src is the source frequency, c is the speed of light, v_obs is the observer's velocity, and v_src is the source's velocity.\n\nIn this case, the observer is stationary, so v_obs = 0. The charged particle is moving towards the observer at a speed of 0.8c, so v_src = -0.8c (negative because it's moving towards the observer).\n\nWe are given the distance between successive crests (wavelength) as 10 cm, which we need to convert to meters: 0.1 m. We can use the speed of light (c = 3 * 10^8 m/s) and the wavelength to find the source frequency:\n\nf_src = c / λ\nf_src = (3 * 10^8 m/s) / 0.1 m\nf_src = 3 * 10^9 Hz\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_obs = (3 * 10^9 Hz) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (3 * 10^8 m/s - (-0.8 * 3 * 10^8 m/s))\nf_obs = (3 * 10^9 Hz) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (1.8 * 3 * 10^8 m/s)\nf_obs = (3 * 10^9 Hz) * (1 / 1.8)\n\nf_obs ≈ 1.67 * 10^9 Hz\n\nSo the frequency of the radiation as measured by the observer is approximately 1.67 * 10^9 Hz."
