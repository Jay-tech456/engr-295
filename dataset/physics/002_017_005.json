    "message_2": "To find the critical pressure of water at a temperature of 200°C, we need to use the principle of corresponding states. This principle states that the properties of a substance at a given reduced temperature and reduced pressure are the same as those of any other substance at the same reduced temperature and reduced pressure.\n\nThe reduced temperature (Tr) is defined as the ratio of the actual temperature (T) to the critical temperature (Tc). The reduced pressure (Pr) is defined as the ratio of the actual pressure (P) to the critical pressure (Pc). The reduced volume (Vr) is defined as the ratio of the actual volume (V) to the critical volume (Vc).\n\nTr = T / Tc\nPr = P / Pc\nVr = V / Vc\n\nWe are given the critical temperature (Tc) of water as 374°C, and we need to find the critical pressure (Pc) at a temperature of 200°C.\n\nFirst, let's find the reduced temperature (Tr) at 200°C:\n\nTr = T / Tc\nTr = (200 + 273.15) / (374 + 273.15)  # Converting temperatures to Kelvin\nTr = 473.15 / 647.15\nTr ≈ 0.731\n\nNow, we need to find the reduced pressure (Pr) corresponding to this reduced temperature (Tr). For this, we can use the generalized compressibility chart or an equation of state. However, since we don't have access to the compressibility chart and no specific equation of state is provided, we cannot proceed further to find the critical pressure at 200°C.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional information such as a compressibility chart or an equation of state, it is not possible to determine the critical pressure of water at a temperature of 200°C."
