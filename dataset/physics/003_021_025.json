    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil of 500 turns and a secondary coil of 2000 turns. The current in the primary coil is 6 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a point that is 2 cm away from the center of the transformer. Assume that the transformer is ideal, and neglect any losses or imperfections.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the center of the transformer, we need to find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil and the secondary coil separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil. The formula for the magnetic field (B) produced by a solenoid (coil) is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nWe are given the total number of turns in the primary coil (N₁ = 500) and the current in the primary coil (I₁ = 6 A). However, we don't have the length of the primary coil. Since we don't have enough information to find the magnetic field produced by the primary coil, we cannot proceed with the calculation.\n\nSimilarly, we would need the length of the secondary coil to calculate the magnetic field produced by it.\n\nIn conclusion, without the lengths of the primary and secondary coils, we cannot calculate the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the center of the transformer."
