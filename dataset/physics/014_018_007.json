    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. They constantly bombard Earth and other objects in the solar system, including space probes. During long-term space missions, cosmic rays can have significant effects on the energy and behavior of space probes. Some of these effects include:\n\n1. Damage to electronic components: Cosmic rays can penetrate the spacecraft's shielding and interact with electronic components, causing damage or even failure of these components. This is known as single-event effects (SEEs), which can lead to temporary or permanent malfunctions in the spacecraft's systems. To mitigate this risk, space probes are designed with radiation-hardened components and redundant systems to ensure continued operation even if some components are damaged.\n\n2. Degradation of materials: The continuous bombardment of cosmic rays can cause the degradation of materials used in the construction of space probes. This can lead to a reduction in the structural integrity and functionality of the spacecraft over time. Engineers take this into account when designing space probes, using materials with high resistance to radiation damage and accounting for the expected degradation over the mission's lifetime.\n\n3. Changes in energy levels: Cosmic rays can deposit energy into the spacecraft's systems as they interact with the materials and components. This can lead to changes in the energy levels of the spacecraft, which may affect its performance and behavior. For example, the spacecraft's power systems may experience fluctuations in output due to the energy deposited by cosmic rays.\n\n4. Effects on scientific instruments: Cosmic rays can also interfere with the measurements taken by scientific instruments on board space probes. For instance, detectors designed to measure radiation or particles in space can be affected by the background cosmic ray flux, making it challenging to distinguish between the signals of interest and the noise introduced by cosmic rays. Scientists and engineers must develop techniques to account for and minimize the impact of cosmic rays on their measurements.\n\n5. Increased radiation exposure for crewed missions: While not directly related to space probes, it's worth noting that cosmic rays pose a significant radiation hazard for astronauts during long-term space missions. Prolonged exposure to cosmic rays can increase the risk of radiation-related health issues, such as cancer. This is a major concern for future crewed missions to Mars or other deep-space destinations, and researchers are actively working on developing better radiation shielding and countermeasures to protect astronauts.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays can affect the energy and behavior of space probes during long-term space missions by damaging electronic components, degrading materials, causing changes in energy levels, interfering with scientific instruments, and posing radiation hazards for crewed missions. Engineers and scientists must carefully consider these effects when designing space probes and planning missions to ensure the success and longevity of these spacecraft."
