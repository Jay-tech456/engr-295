    "message_1": "What is the distance between the two slits if the first-order bright fringe of a double-slit experiment with a wavelength of 550 nm and a slit separation of 0.25 mm is observed at an angle of 14.6 degrees from the central maximum on a screen located 1.5 m away from the slits?",
    "message_2": "The distance between the two slits is already given as 0.25 mm. However, I believe you want to find the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe on the screen.\n\nTo find this distance, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first-order bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the slit separation.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nθ = 14.6 degrees\nm = 1\nλ = 550 nm = 550 * 10^(-9) m\nd = 0.25 mm = 0.25 * 10^(-3) m\n\nFirst, we need to find sin(θ):\n\nsin(14.6) ≈ 0.251\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\n0.251 = (1 * 550 * 10^(-9)) / (0.25 * 10^(-3))\n\nNow, we can solve for the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe on the screen (L):\n\nL = 1.5 * tan(14.6)\nL ≈ 1.5 * 0.265\nL ≈ 0.3975 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the first-order bright fringe on the screen is approximately 0.3975 meters."
