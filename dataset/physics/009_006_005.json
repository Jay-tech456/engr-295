    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 600 / 50\n\nv = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 12 cm from the mirror.\n\nNext, we'll find the magnification (M) of the image using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -12/30\n\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification of the image is -0.4, which means the image is inverted (due to the negative sign) and reduced in size (since the absolute value of the magnification is less than 1) compared to the object."
