    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the lens, we will use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -20 cm (diverging lens)\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe need to find di:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n-30 + 20di = -di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\n\ndi = -30 cm / (20 - 1)\ndi = -30 cm / 19\ndi ≈ -1.58 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is typical for a diverging lens.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nwhere M is the magnification.\n\nM = -(-1.58) / 30\nM ≈ 0.053\n\nThe magnification is less than 1, which means the image is smaller than the object. To find the size of the image, we can multiply the magnification by the object size. Let's assume the object size is h_o:\n\nh_i = M * h_o\nh_i ≈ 0.053 * h_o\n\nThe image height (h_i) is approximately 5.3% of the object height (h_o).\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the diverging lens is located approximately 1.58 cm from the lens on the same side as the object, and its size is about 5.3% of the object size."
