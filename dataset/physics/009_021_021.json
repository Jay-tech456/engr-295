    "message_1": "A beam of polarized light passes through two polarizing filters whose axes are inclined at an angle of 30° with each other. If the intensity of the incident beam is 10 W/m², what will be the intensity of the light that passes through the second filter?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the light that passes through the second filter, we can use Malus's law, which states that the transmitted intensity (I_t) is equal to the incident intensity (I_i) multiplied by the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters (θ).\n\nI_t = I_i * cos²(θ)\n\nIn this case, the incident intensity (I_i) is 10 W/m², and the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters (θ) is 30°.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Malus's law:\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * cos²(π/6)\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * (0.866)²\n\nI_t ≈ 10 W/m² * 0.75\n\nI_t ≈ 7.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light that passes through the second filter is approximately 7.5 W/m²."
