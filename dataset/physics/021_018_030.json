    "message_2": "The bending of light caused by the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole can be calculated using the formula for gravitational lensing. The formula for the deflection angle (α) is given by:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), and b is the impact parameter, which is the distance of closest approach of the light to the black hole.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 10 times the mass of the Sun (M = 10 * M_sun, where M_sun = 1.989 × 10^30 kg), we can calculate the deflection angle:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nTo find the deflection angle for a star located behind the black hole, we need to know the impact parameter (b). However, since we don't have this information, we can only provide a general description of how the bending of light affects the appearance of the star.\n\nWhen light from a star passes close to a massive object like a black hole, the gravitational field of the black hole bends the light, causing the star to appear in a different position than it would if the black hole were not present. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing. In the case of a Schwarzschild black hole, the lensing effect can cause the star to appear as a ring of light around the black hole, known as an \"Einstein ring,\" if the alignment between the observer, black hole, and the star is perfect. If the alignment is not perfect, the star may appear as an arc or multiple images around the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the bending of light caused by the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to 10 times that of the Sun can significantly affect the appearance of a star located behind the black hole as seen from an observer on Earth, causing the star to appear as a ring, arc, or multiple images around the black hole."
