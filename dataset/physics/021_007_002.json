    "message_2": "When a star approaches and interacts with a black hole, its orbit will be significantly affected due to the immense gravitational pull of the black hole. The star's speed and trajectory will change as it gets closer to the black hole, and it may experience one of the following outcomes:\n\n1. The star may be captured by the black hole and eventually be consumed by it.\n2. The star may be flung out of the system at high speeds due to gravitational slingshot effect.\n3. The star may settle into a stable orbit around the black hole, forming a binary system.\n\nTo calculate the expected changes in the star's speed and trajectory, we can use the following information:\n\n1. Mass of the black hole (M_bh)\n2. Mass of the star (M_star)\n3. Initial distance between the black hole and the star (r_initial)\n4. Initial velocity of the star (v_initial)\n\nUsing the conservation of angular momentum and energy, we can determine the star's speed and trajectory at any point during its interaction with the black hole. The equations are:\n\n1. Conservation of angular momentum: L = M_star * r * v = constant\n2. Conservation of energy: E = 0.5 * M_star * v^2 - G * M_bh * M_star / r = constant\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the star's speed (v) and distance from the black hole (r) at any given time. However, this is a complex problem that typically requires numerical methods and simulations to obtain accurate results.\n\nIn summary, the star's speed and trajectory will be significantly affected as it approaches and interacts with a black hole. The exact changes depend on the initial conditions and the masses of the black hole and the star. Numerical simulations are often used to study these interactions and predict the outcomes."
