    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance (distance from the lens to the candle flame), and v is the image distance (distance from the lens to the image formed).\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 600 / 50\nv = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 12 cm from the lens.\n\nNext, we'll find the magnification (M) of the image using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12/30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification of the image is -0.4, which means the image is inverted (since the magnification is negative) and 0.4 times smaller than the object (candle flame)."
