    "message_1": "A long, thin, and straight cylindrical wire with a radius of 0.5 cm carries a current of 2.5 A. What is the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the center of the wire.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 2.5 A, and the distance r is 5 cm, which is equal to 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (10^(-6) T·m/A * 2.5 A) / 0.1 m\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire is 2.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
