    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 3 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 5.967 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 5.967 × 10^30 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (7.978 × 10^20 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) / (9.0 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nr_s ≈ 8.864 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,864 meters or 8.864 kilometers."
