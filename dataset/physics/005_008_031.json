What length will an observer on Earth measure the object to be? Use the Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the object as measured by an observer on Earth, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the length measured by the observer on Earth, L0 is the proper length (the length measured by the observer on the spaceship), v is the relative velocity between the Earth and the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, L0 = 100 meters, v = 0.8c, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the length L:\n\nL = 100 * sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 100 * sqrt(0.36) = 100 * 0.6 = 60 meters\n\nSo, an observer on Earth will measure the object to be 60 meters long."
