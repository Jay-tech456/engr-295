    "message_2": "Non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation refers to the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, thus not producing ions. This includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, and some parts of the ultraviolet spectrum.\n\nThe effect of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation on the growth rate of human cells depends on the specific type of radiation, its intensity, and the duration of exposure. In general, low levels of non-ionizing radiation are not considered harmful to human cells, as they do not have enough energy to cause significant damage to cellular structures or DNA.\n\nHowever, at higher intensities or prolonged exposure, some non-ionizing radiation can cause biological effects, such as heating of tissues (e.g., microwave radiation) or photochemical reactions (e.g., ultraviolet radiation). These effects can potentially influence cell growth and function, but the exact mechanisms and consequences are not fully understood and may vary depending on the specific type of radiation and the cells being studied.\n\nFor example, some studies have suggested that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), such as those emitted by cell phones, may have an effect on cell growth and proliferation, but the results are not consistent and more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nIn summary, the effect of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation on the growth rate of human cells depends on the specific type of radiation, its intensity, and the duration of exposure. While low levels of non-ionizing radiation are generally considered safe, higher intensities or prolonged exposure can potentially cause biological effects that may influence cell growth and function. However, more research is needed to fully understand these effects and their implications for human health."
