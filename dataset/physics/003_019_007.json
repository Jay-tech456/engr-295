    "message_1": "What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 2cm from the center of a coaxial cable with an outer radius of 3cm and an inner radius of 2cm, carrying a current of 2A in the positive $z$-direction?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nIn this case, the point is located at the inner radius of the coaxial cable (2 cm). Since the current is flowing in the positive z-direction, the magnetic field will be in the azimuthal direction (tangential to the circle with a radius of 2 cm).\n\nLet's consider a circular loop of radius r = 2 cm centered at the center of the coaxial cable. The closed line integral of the magnetic field around this loop is:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nThe enclosed current is 2 A. Therefore, according to Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Now, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.02 m\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 2 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is approximately 1.2566 × 10^(-4) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction, tangential to the circle with a radius of 2 cm, and it follows the right-hand rule with respect to the current direction (positive z-direction)."
