    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, a single photon passes through one of the two slits and then creates an interference pattern on the screen. The probability of a single photon passing through both slits simultaneously is not possible, as photons are elementary particles and cannot be in two places at once.\n\nHowever, the interference pattern observed in the double-slit experiment is a result of the wave-like nature of photons. When a single photon passes through one of the slits, it behaves as a wave and interferes with itself, creating the pattern on the screen. This phenomenon is known as wave-particle duality, where particles like photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.\n\nSo, while it's not possible for a single photon to pass through both slits simultaneously, the interference pattern observed is due to the wave-like nature of the photon interfering with itself after passing through one of the slits."
