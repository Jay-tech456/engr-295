    "message_2": "When a star or a planet gets close to a black hole, several phenomena can occur due to the intense gravitational interaction between the celestial body and the black hole. Some of the specific effects include:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: The black hole's immense gravity pulls the star or planet towards it. If the celestial body is close enough and moving at a low enough velocity, it may be captured by the black hole and eventually be swallowed by it.\n\n2. Tidal forces: The difference in gravitational forces acting on the near and far sides of the celestial body creates tidal forces. These forces can stretch and compress the celestial body, leading to tidal deformation. In extreme cases, the tidal forces can be so strong that they cause the celestial body to break apart, a process known as \"spaghettification.\"\n\n3. Accretion disk formation: As the celestial body gets closer to the black hole, the tidal forces can cause the material from the celestial body to form an accretion disk around the black hole. This disk of gas and dust spirals inward, heating up and emitting radiation as it gets closer to the event horizon.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: The interaction between the celestial body and the black hole can cause the emission of gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime that propagate outward from the source. These waves can be detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo.\n\n5. Relativistic effects: As the celestial body gets closer to the black hole, it experiences relativistic effects due to the intense gravitational field. Time dilation occurs, meaning that time passes more slowly for the celestial body compared to an observer far away from the black hole. Additionally, the celestial body's path will be influenced by the curvature of spacetime around the black hole, causing it to follow a curved trajectory.\n\nIn summary, when a star or a planet gets close to a black hole, it experiences strong gravitational attraction, tidal forces, accretion disk formation, gravitational wave emission, and relativistic effects. Depending on the specific circumstances, these interactions can lead to the destruction of the celestial body or its eventual capture by the black hole."
