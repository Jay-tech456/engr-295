    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. In the case of the hydrogen atom, the Stark effect causes the energy levels to shift and the spectral lines to split into multiple components. This occurs because the electric field interacts with the electric dipole moment of the atom, leading to a change in the energy levels.\n\nWhen an electric field of intensity 5 kV/cm is applied to a hydrogen atom, the Stark effect will cause the spectral lines to split. The splitting of the spectral lines depends on the quantum numbers of the energy levels involved. For simplicity, let's consider the n=2 energy level of the hydrogen atom, which has a single s-orbital (l=0) and three p-orbitals (l=1).\n\nThe s-orbital is not affected by the electric field because it has no electric dipole moment. However, the p-orbitals will experience a shift in energy levels due to their nonzero electric dipole moment. The p-orbitals will split into two groups: one with m_l = 0 and the other with m_l = ±1. The energy difference between these two groups is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = 3/4 * e * F * a₀\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C), F is the electric field intensity (5 × 10⁵ V/m), and a₀ is the Bohr radius (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m).\n\nΔE = 3/4 * (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) * (5 × 10⁵ V/m) * (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.58 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\nSo, the energy difference between the original and final energy states due to the Stark effect in the presence of a 5 kV/cm electric field is approximately 1.58 × 10⁻²⁰ J. This energy difference will cause the spectral lines to split, leading to a more complex pattern in the hydrogen atom's spectrum."
