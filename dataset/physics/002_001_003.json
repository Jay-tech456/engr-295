    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the thermodynamic process, we can use the formula for work done at constant pressure:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nGiven the initial volume (V1) is 5 L and the final volume (V2) is 3 L, we can calculate the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V2 - V1 = 3 L - 5 L = -2 L\n\nNow, we can convert the pressure from atm to the SI unit of pressure, Pascal (Pa):\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = - (101325 Pa) * (-2 L)\n\nTo convert the volume from liters to cubic meters, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 L = 0.001 m³\n\nSo, -2 L = -0.002 m³\n\nNow, we can plug the converted volume into the formula:\n\nW = - (101325 Pa) * (-0.002 m³)\n\nW = 202.65 J\n\nTherefore, the work done by the gas during the thermodynamic process is 202.65 Joules."
