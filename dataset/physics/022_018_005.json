    "message_1": "What is the minimum mass that a brown dwarf needs to have in order to qualify as a MACHO and would it be able to account for the amount of dark matter observed in the universe?",
    "message_2": "A brown dwarf is a celestial object that is intermediate in mass between a planet and a star. They are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores like main-sequence stars. MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are a type of dark matter candidate that consists of massive, compact objects like brown dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.\n\nTo qualify as a MACHO, a brown dwarf should have a mass of at least 0.01 solar masses (Mâ˜‰), which is approximately 10 Jupiter masses (MJ). This is the minimum mass required for an object to be considered a MACHO, as objects with lower masses would not have a significant gravitational effect on their surroundings.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that brown dwarfs can account for the total amount of dark matter observed in the universe. Observations from microlensing surveys, such as the MACHO Project and EROS, have shown that MACHOs can only account for a small fraction of the dark matter in the Milky Way's halo. The majority of dark matter is believed to be non-baryonic, meaning it is not made up of protons, neutrons, or electrons, and is not directly detectable through electromagnetic radiation. This is in contrast to MACHOs, which are baryonic in nature.\n\nIn conclusion, while brown dwarfs with a mass of at least 0.01 solar masses can qualify as MACHOs, they are not sufficient to account for the total amount of dark matter observed in the universe. The search for the true nature of dark matter continues, with candidates such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) and axions being the focus of ongoing research."
