    "message_1": "A light source emits unpolarized light of intensity 10 W/m². The light is passing through two polarizers: the first one transmits only 25% of the incident light and the second one is turned at an angle of 45º with respect to the transmission axis of the first one. What is the intensity of the light that emerges from the second polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the intensity of the light after passing through each polarizer.\n\n1. Intensity after the first polarizer:\n\nSince the first polarizer transmits only 25% of the incident light, the intensity after passing through the first polarizer is:\n\nI1 = (25/100) * I0\nI1 = 0.25 * 10 W/m²\nI1 = 2.5 W/m²\n\n2. Intensity after the second polarizer:\n\nThe second polarizer is turned at an angle of 45º with respect to the transmission axis of the first one. The intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer can be calculated using Malus' law:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos²θ\n\nwhere I2 is the intensity after the second polarizer, I1 is the intensity after the first polarizer, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, θ = 45º, so:\n\nI2 = 2.5 W/m² * cos²(45º)\nI2 = 2.5 W/m² * (1/√2)²\nI2 = 2.5 W/m² * 1/2\nI2 = 1.25 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light that emerges from the second polarizer is 1.25 W/m²."
