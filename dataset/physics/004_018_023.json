    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon as it travels from the surface of a planet to a point at infinity, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift, which is given by:\n\nΔλ/λ = (GM/c^2R)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the planet, c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), and R is the radius of the planet.\n\nThe gravitational redshift factor, z, can be calculated as:\n\nz = Δλ/λ\n\nSo, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nz = (GM/c^2R)\n\nThis formula gives the amount of gravitational redshift experienced by a photon as it travels from the surface of a planet with mass M and radius R to a point at infinity."
