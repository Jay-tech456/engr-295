Calculate the angle of deflection of light caused by a spherical mass M at a distance D, given the parameters of the incident light ray and assumptions of the Schwarzschild metric.",
    "message_2": "According to the theory of General Relativity, a massive object causes a curvature in spacetime, which affects the path of light. When light passes close to a massive object, its path is bent due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the object's mass. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing is observed in astronomy when light from a distant object, such as a galaxy or a star, passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as another galaxy or a black hole, before reaching the observer. The massive object acts as a lens, bending the light and causing the distant object to appear distorted or magnified.\n\nTo calculate the angle of deflection of light caused by a spherical mass M at a distance D, we can use the formula derived from the Schwarzschild metric:\n\nΔθ = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * D)\n\nwhere:\nΔθ is the angle of deflection,\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nM is the mass of the spherical object,\nc is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s), and\nD is the distance between the light ray and the center of the spherical object.\n\nGiven the parameters of the incident light ray and the assumptions of the Schwarzschild metric, you can plug in the values for M and D to calculate the angle of deflection, Δθ."
