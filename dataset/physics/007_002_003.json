    "message_1": "What is the half-life of a radioactive element if it has an initial mass of 400 grams and after 100 years it has decayed to a mass of 100 grams. Also, calculate the decay constant and the remaining mass after 400 years.",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of a radioactive element, we can use the decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the mass at time t, N0 is the initial mass, t is the time, and T is the half-life.\n\nIn this problem, we have N0 = 400 grams, N(t) = 100 grams, and t = 100 years. We need to find T.\n\n100 = 400 * (1/2)^(100/T)\n\nDivide both sides by 400:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(100/T)\n\nTake the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.25) = (100/T) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, divide by log(1/2):\n\nlog(0.25) / log(1/2) = 100/T\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\nT = 100 / (log(0.25) / log(1/2))\n\nT ≈ 50 years\n\nThe half-life of the radioactive element is approximately 50 years.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the decay constant (λ). The decay constant is related to the half-life by the following equation:\n\nT = ln(2) / λ\n\nSolve for λ:\n\nλ = ln(2) / T\n\nλ ≈ ln(2) / 50\n\nλ ≈ 0.013863\n\nThe decay constant is approximately 0.013863 per year.\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the remaining mass after 400 years. We can use the decay formula again:\n\nN(400) = N0 * (1/2)^(400/T)\n\nN(400) = 400 * (1/2)^(400/50)\n\nN(400) ≈ 400 * (1/2)^8\n\nN(400) ≈ 400 * 0.00390625\n\nN(400) ≈ 1.5625 grams\n\nAfter 400 years, the remaining mass of the radioactive element is approximately 1.5625 grams."
