    "message_2": "The W and Z bosons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for mediating the weak nuclear force. The masses of these particles have been measured experimentally and are also predicted theoretically within the framework of the Standard Model.\n\nThe measured masses of the W and Z bosons are:\n\n- W boson: 80.379 ± 0.012 GeV/c²\n- Z boson: 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV/c²\n\nThe theoretical predictions for their masses are derived from the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, which is based on the Higgs mechanism. The masses of the W and Z bosons are related to the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field and the electroweak coupling constants. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental measurements, with uncertainties at the level of 0.01% or better.\n\nThe small discrepancy between the measured and predicted masses of the W and Z bosons does not significantly affect our understanding of their properties and interactions. The agreement between theory and experiment is a strong validation of the Standard Model and the Higgs mechanism. However, it is essential to continue refining the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations to search for any potential deviations that could hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Standard Model is not a complete description of the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. It does not include gravity, dark matter, or dark energy, and it does not explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Therefore, while the agreement between the measured and predicted masses of the W and Z bosons supports the validity of the Standard Model, physicists continue to search for new phenomena that could help address these outstanding questions."
