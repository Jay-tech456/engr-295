Determine the lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame and the speed of the daughter particles, assuming that they have equal masses.",
    "message_2": "First, let's determine the lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame. We know that the particle travels a distance of 0.5 km at a speed of 0.6c. \n\nThe time it takes for the particle to travel this distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\ntime = 0.5 km / (0.6 * c)\ntime = 0.5 * 10^3 m / (0.6 * 3 * 10^8 m/s)\ntime ≈ 2.78 * 10^-6 s\n\nNow, we need to account for time dilation due to the particle's relativistic speed. The time dilation factor can be calculated using the Lorentz factor:\n\nLorentz factor (γ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame is given by:\n\nlifetime = time * γ\nlifetime ≈ 2.78 * 10^-6 s * 1.25\nlifetime ≈ 3.47 * 10^-6 s\n\nNow, let's determine the speed of the daughter particles. Since the particle decays into two daughter particles with equal masses, we can use conservation of momentum to find their speeds. The initial momentum of the parent particle is:\n\nmomentum = mass * speed\n\nWe need to find the relativistic mass of the parent particle:\n\nrelativistic mass = rest mass * γ\nrelativistic mass = 4 GeV/c^2 * 1.25\nrelativistic mass ≈ 5 GeV/c^2\n\nNow, we can find the initial momentum:\n\nmomentum = 5 GeV/c * 0.6c\nmomentum = 3 GeV/c\n\nSince the momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the daughter particles is also 3 GeV/c. Assuming they have equal masses and move in opposite directions, their individual momenta will be half of the total momentum:\n\nmomentum_daughter = 3 GeV/c / 2\nmomentum_daughter = 1.5 GeV/c\n\nNow, we can find the speed of the daughter particles. Since they have equal masses, their speeds will be the same. We can use the following formula to find their speeds:\n\nspeed = momentum / (mass * γ)\n\nWe need to find the Lorentz factor for the daughter particles. Since their momenta are equal and opposite, their speeds will also be equal and opposite. Let's call their speed v_d:\n\nγ_d = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_d^2 / c^2))\n\nNow, we can solve for v_d:\n\nv_d = 1.5 GeV/c / (4 GeV/c^2 * γ_d)\nv_d = 1.5 / (4 * γ_d)\n\nSquaring both sides and substituting the expression for γ_d:\n\nv_d^2 = 2.25 / (16 * (1 - (v_d^2 / c^2)))\nv_d^2 * (1 - (v_d^2 / c^2)) = 2.25 / 16\nv_d^2 - v_d^4 / c^2 = 2.25 / 16\n\nThis is a quartic equation in v_d^2, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can solve it numerically to find the speed of the daughter particles:\n\nv_d ≈ 0.35c\n\nSo, the lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame is approximately 3.47 * 10^-6 s, and the speed of the daughter particles is approximately 0.35c."
