    "message_1": "A motor has a wire with a length of 2 meters that carries a current of 3 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven:\nI = 3 A (current)\nr = 5 cm = 0.05 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^-7 Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 120π × 10^-7 T\n\nB ≈ 3.77 × 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is approximately 3.77 × 10^-6 Tesla."
