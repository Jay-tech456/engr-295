    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we need to know the masses of the two neutron stars (M1 and M2) and their distance from each other (R). The distance from Earth is not directly relevant to the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system can be determined using the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * (M1 + M2) / R^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational waves\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the two neutron stars\n- R is the distance between the two neutron stars\n\nPlease provide the masses of the two neutron stars and their distance from each other, and I can calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger."
