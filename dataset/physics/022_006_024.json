    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observed gravitational interaction between two galaxies compared to the predicted gravitational interaction based solely on the visible matter in those galaxies. Here's how:\n\n1. Increased gravitational force: Dark matter, although invisible, has mass and therefore contributes to the overall gravitational force between galaxies. Since dark matter is estimated to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe, its presence leads to a much stronger gravitational interaction between galaxies than what would be predicted by considering only visible matter.\n\n2. Modified rotation curves: The rotation curves of galaxies, which show the relationship between the orbital speed of stars and their distance from the galactic center, are significantly influenced by dark matter. In the absence of dark matter, the orbital speeds of stars would decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center, following the distribution of visible matter. However, observations show that the rotation curves remain relatively flat, indicating that there is more mass present than what is visible. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Galaxy cluster stability: Galaxy clusters are held together by the gravitational force between their constituent galaxies. If we consider only the visible matter in these galaxies, the gravitational force would be insufficient to hold the clusters together, and they would disperse over time. The presence of dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to maintain the stability of galaxy clusters.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: The presence of dark matter also affects the observed gravitational lensing, which is the bending of light due to the gravitational influence of massive objects. The amount of lensing observed around galaxy clusters is much greater than what would be expected based on the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which increases the overall mass and hence the gravitational influence of the galaxy clusters.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the observed gravitational interaction between galaxies, leading to stronger gravitational forces, modified rotation curves, stable galaxy clusters, and enhanced gravitational lensing compared to what would be predicted based on visible matter alone."
