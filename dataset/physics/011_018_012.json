    "message_2": "The chirality of a carbon nanotube (CNT) has a significant impact on its electronic band structure, which in turn determines its electrical properties. Chirality is defined by the chiral vector (n, m) that describes how the graphene sheet is rolled up to form the nanotube. Based on the values of n and m, carbon nanotubes can be classified into three types: armchair, zigzag, and chiral.\n\n1. Armchair nanotubes (n = m): In armchair CNTs, the chiral vector lies along the edge of the graphene sheet, and the nanotube appears to have an \"armchair\" edge structure. These nanotubes are always metallic, meaning they have excellent electrical conductivity. The electronic band structure of armchair CNTs exhibits a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi level, leading to a zero bandgap.\n\n2. Zigzag nanotubes (m = 0): In zigzag CNTs, the chiral vector is perpendicular to the edge of the graphene sheet, resulting in a \"zigzag\" edge structure. The electronic properties of zigzag nanotubes depend on the value of n. If n is a multiple of 3 (n = 3p, where p is an integer), the nanotube is metallic with a zero bandgap. Otherwise, it is a semiconductor with a small bandgap that depends on the nanotube diameter.\n\n3. Chiral nanotubes (n ≠ m, m ≠ 0): Chiral CNTs have a chiral vector that is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the edge of the graphene sheet. The electronic properties of chiral nanotubes also depend on the values of n and m. If (n - m) is a multiple of 3, the nanotube is metallic. Otherwise, it is a semiconductor with a bandgap that depends on the nanotube diameter and chiral angle.\n\nIn summary, the chirality of a carbon nanotube plays a crucial role in determining its electronic band structure and electrical properties. Armchair nanotubes are always metallic, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on the values of n and m. The bandgap of semiconducting nanotubes is influenced by the nanotube diameter and chiral angle."
