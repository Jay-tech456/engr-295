    "message_2": "In 2+1 dimensions, the chiral anomaly refers to the non-conservation of the chiral current for massless Dirac fermions due to quantum effects. The chiral anomaly is typically described by the divergence of the chiral current, which can be expressed as:\n\n∂_μ j^μ_5 = C * Fμν * F̃μν\n\nHere, j^μ_5 is the chiral current, Fμν is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, F̃μν is the dual field strength tensor, and C is a constant that depends on the regularization scheme and the number of fermion species.\n\nIn 2+1 dimensions, the field strength tensor Fμν has three components (μ, ν = 0, 1, 2), and the dual field strength tensor F̃μν is given by:\n\nF̃μν = 1/2 * εμνρ * Fρσ\n\nwhere εμνρ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nThe chiral anomaly can also be affected by the curvature of spacetime. In curved spacetime, the covariant derivative replaces the ordinary derivative in the expression for the divergence of the chiral current:\n\n∇_μ j^μ_5 = C * Fμν * F̃μν + D * R\n\nHere, ∇_μ is the covariant derivative, R is the Ricci scalar curvature, and D is another constant that depends on the regularization scheme and the number of fermion species.\n\nIn summary, the explicit expression for the chiral anomaly in 2+1 dimensions depends on the gauge field through the field strength tensor Fμν and its dual F̃μν, as well as on the curvature of spacetime through the Ricci scalar R. The coefficients C and D depend on the regularization scheme and the number of fermion species."
