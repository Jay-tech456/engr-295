    "message_1": "A diverging lens with a focal length of 35 cm is placed 25 cm from an object. What is the image distance, and is the image virtual or real?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. Since the lens is diverging, the focal length will be negative. So, f = -35 cm and do = 25 cm.\n\n1/(-35) = 1/25 + 1/di\n\nTo find the image distance (di), we can first find the common denominator and then solve for di:\n\n(-25 - 35) / (25 * -35) = 1/di\n-60 / -875 = 1/di\ndi = 875 / 60\ndi â‰ˆ 14.58 cm\n\nThe image distance is approximately 14.58 cm. Since the image distance is positive, the image is virtual. A diverging lens always forms a virtual, upright, and reduced image."
