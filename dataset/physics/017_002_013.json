    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the magnetic properties of iron can be explained through the concept of the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature (Tc) is the critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic. For iron, the Curie temperature is approximately 770Â°C (1043 K).\n\nAt temperatures below the Curie temperature, iron exhibits strong ferromagnetic properties. This is due to the alignment of the magnetic moments of the atoms in the material, which results in a net magnetic field. The magnetic domains in the iron are aligned, and the material exhibits strong magnetic properties.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the thermal energy causes the atoms in the material to vibrate more, which in turn disturbs the alignment of the magnetic moments. When the temperature reaches the Curie point, the thermal energy is sufficient to overcome the magnetic interactions between the atoms, and the material loses its ferromagnetism. At this point, the magnetic moments become randomly oriented, and the material becomes paramagnetic.\n\nIn the paramagnetic state, the magnetic moments are still present, but they are no longer aligned. The material will still respond to an external magnetic field, but the response will be much weaker than in the ferromagnetic state. As the temperature increases further, the magnetic susceptibility of the material decreases, and the material becomes less responsive to an external magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, as the temperature of iron increases, its magnetic properties weaken. When the temperature reaches the Curie point, iron loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic. The magnetic susceptibility of the material continues to decrease as the temperature increases further."
