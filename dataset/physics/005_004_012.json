    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy and momentum of a particle, we first need to determine its Lorentz factor, which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor a particle moving at 0.80c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.80c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic momentum (p) using the formula:\n\np = γ * m * v\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle.\n\np ≈ 1.667 * 2 kg * 0.80c\np ≈ 2.667 kg * c\n\nThe relativistic momentum of the particle is approximately 2.667 kg*c.\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy (K) using the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c²\n\nK ≈ (1.667 - 1) * 2 kg * c²\nK ≈ 0.667 * 2 kg * c²\nK ≈ 1.334 kg * c²\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 1.334 kg * c²."
