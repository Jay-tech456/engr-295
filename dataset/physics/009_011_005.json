    "message_1": "A lens maker manufactures a convex lens with a focal length of 20 cm, using a material with an index of refraction of 1.5. What should be the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces?",
    "message_2": "To find the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 20 cm) and the index of refraction (n = 1.5). We need to find R1 and R2. Since there are two unknowns, we need an additional constraint to solve the problem. A common constraint is to assume that the lens is symmetric, meaning that the two surfaces have the same curvature, but with opposite signs (R1 = -R2). This simplifies the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/(-R1)).\n\nNow we can solve for R1:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (2/R1),\nR1 = 2*(n-1)*f.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR1 = 2*(1.5-1)*20,\nR1 = 2*0.5*20,\nR1 = 20 cm.\n\nSince the lens is symmetric, R2 = -R1:\n\nR2 = -20 cm.\n\nSo, the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces should be R1 = 20 cm and R2 = -20 cm."
