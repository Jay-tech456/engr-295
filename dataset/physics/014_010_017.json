    "message_2": "The behavior of matter falling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a stellar black hole (SBH) is primarily determined by the mass and size of the black holes. Supermassive black holes have masses millions to billions times that of our Sun, while stellar black holes have masses around 3 to 20 times that of our Sun. Due to their different masses and sizes, the matter falling into these black holes behaves differently.\n\n1. Accretion disk: When matter falls into a black hole, it forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The accretion disk around a SMBH is much larger and more luminous than that around a SBH. This is because the larger mass of the SMBH leads to a stronger gravitational pull, which causes more matter to be attracted and heated up, emitting more radiation.\n\n2. Tidal forces: Tidal forces are the difference in gravitational pull experienced by an object due to the varying distance from the black hole. In the case of a SMBH, the tidal forces are weaker near the event horizon compared to a SBH. This is because the event horizon of a SMBH is much larger than that of a SBH. As a result, an object falling into a SMBH would experience less spaghettification (stretching and compressing due to tidal forces) than an object falling into a SBH.\n\n3. Emission of radiation: As matter falls into a black hole and forms an accretion disk, it emits radiation. The radiation emitted by a SMBH is generally more powerful than that emitted by a SBH. This is due to the larger amount of matter being accreted and the higher temperatures in the accretion disk around a SMBH.\n\nObservational evidence supporting these differences includes:\n\n1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): AGNs are extremely bright and energetic sources of radiation found at the centers of some galaxies. They are believed to be powered by SMBHs accreting matter. The high luminosity and powerful radiation emitted by AGNs provide evidence for the presence of SMBHs and their accretion processes.\n\n2. Quasars: Quasars are a type of AGN that emit enormous amounts of energy, primarily in the form of light. They are among the most luminous objects in the universe and are thought to be powered by SMBHs at the centers of distant galaxies.\n\n3. X-ray binaries: X-ray binaries are systems in which a compact object, such as a SBH, accretes matter from a companion star. The matter forms an accretion disk around the black hole and emits X-rays as it is heated up. Observations of X-ray binaries provide evidence for the presence of SBHs and their accretion processes.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: The detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo observatories has provided direct evidence for the existence of black holes, including both SMBHs and SBHs. The observed gravitational wave signals are consistent with the merging of black holes, which can provide insights into their masses, sizes, and the behavior of matter around them."
