    "message_2": "To calculate the expected gravitational wave frequency and amplitude for a binary system of black holes, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h): h = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^2 * d)\n\nwhere:\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg)\n- a is the distance between the black holes (in meters)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- M_chirp is the chirp mass, given by: M_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n- d is the distance from the observer to the binary system (we'll assume 1 Mpc, or 3.086 × 10^22 m, for this calculation)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given masses and distance into SI units:\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\nM2 = 20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 3.978 × 10^31 kg\na = 100 km = 100 * 10^3 m = 10^5 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 0.00219 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbital\nf_GW ≈ 0.00438 Hz\n\nNow, let's calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 2.161 × 10^31 kg\n\nFinally, we can calculate the gravitational wave amplitude:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^2 * d)\nh ≈ 1.15 × 10^-22\n\nSo, the expected gravitational wave frequency is approximately 0.00438 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.15 × 10^-22."
