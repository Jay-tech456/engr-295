    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop, we can use Ampere's Law and the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the Biot-Savart Law is more suitable for this problem, we will use it.\n\nThe Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor the triangular loop, we can divide it into three equal parts and find the magnetic field due to each part at the center, and then sum them up.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, and the center as O. Let's first find the magnetic field due to the side AB at the center O.\n\n1. Find the angle θ between the side AB and the line connecting the midpoint of AB to the center O.\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the angle ∠AOB = 60° (π/3 radians).\n\n2. Find the distance from the midpoint of AB to the center O.\n\nLet's denote the midpoint of AB as M. Since the triangle AOM is a 30-60-90 triangle, we can find the distance OM using the side length AM:\n\nOM = (30/2) * tan(π/6) = 15 * √3 cm\n\n3. Calculate the magnetic field dB due to the side AB at the center O.\n\nWe can now find the magnetic field dB due to the side AB at the center O using the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB_AB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * 30 * sin(π/3)) / (15√3)^2\ndB_AB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 30 * (√3/2)) / (675π)\ndB_AB = (60 × 10^(-7) * √3) / (225)\ndB_AB = (20 × 10^(-7) * √3) T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to each side of the triangle is the same, we can find the total magnetic field at the center O by summing up the magnetic fields due to all three sides:\n\nB_total = 3 * dB_AB\nB_total = 3 * (20 × 10^(-7) * √3) T\nB_total ≈ 1.04 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop is approximately 1.04 × 10^(-5) T."
