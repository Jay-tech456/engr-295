    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated by a muscle during contraction, we need to know the stress (force per unit area) generated within the muscle. The stress depends on various factors such as the type of muscle, its activation level, and the specific conditions during contraction. \n\nA common value for the maximum isometric stress generated by skeletal muscle is around 30-40 N/cm² (Newtons per square centimeter). However, as the muscle contracts with a velocity (2 cm/s in this case), the force generated will be less than the maximum isometric stress. This relationship is described by the force-velocity curve of the muscle.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the specific muscle and its activation level, we cannot provide an exact value for the force generated during contraction. However, you can use the maximum isometric stress value (30-40 N/cm²) as a rough estimate to calculate the force by multiplying it with the cross-sectional area:\n\nForce = Stress × Area\n\nAssuming a stress of 30 N/cm²:\nForce = 30 N/cm² × 10 cm² = 300 N\n\nAssuming a stress of 40 N/cm²:\nForce = 40 N/cm² × 10 cm² = 400 N\n\nSo, the force generated by the muscle during contraction could be roughly between 300 N and 400 N, but it will likely be less than these values due to the contraction velocity."
