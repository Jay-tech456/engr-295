    "message_2": "In a Michelson interferometer, increasing the distance between the mirrors improves the sensitivity of detecting gravitational waves. This is because the interferometer measures the difference in the path lengths of the two arms, and a longer arm length results in a larger change in the path length due to a gravitational wave, making it easier to detect.\n\nLet's derive the equation that relates the strain sensitivity (h) to the mirror separation (L) and the laser beam wavelength (λ).\n\nThe Michelson interferometer consists of two perpendicular arms with mirrors at the ends. When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, it causes a change in the length of the arms. The change in length (ΔL) is proportional to the strain (h) and the original length (L) of the arms:\n\nΔL = hL\n\nThe interferometer measures the difference in the path lengths of the two arms by comparing the phase of the light beams that have traveled along the two arms. The phase difference (Δφ) is related to the change in the optical path length (ΔL) and the laser beam wavelength (λ) as follows:\n\nΔφ = 2π(ΔL) / λ\n\nSubstituting the expression for ΔL from the previous equation, we get:\n\nΔφ = 2π(hL) / λ\n\nNow, we can solve for the strain sensitivity (h):\n\nh = (λΔφ) / (2πL)\n\nThis equation shows that the strain sensitivity (h) is inversely proportional to the mirror separation (L) and directly proportional to the laser beam wavelength (λ). Therefore, increasing the distance between the mirrors in a Michelson interferometer improves the sensitivity of detecting gravitational waves."
