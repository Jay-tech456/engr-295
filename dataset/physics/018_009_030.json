    "message_2": "The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass, as described by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nAs a black hole loses mass due to Hawking radiation, its temperature increases. The maximum temperature a black hole can attain is reached just before it completely evaporates. When the black hole's mass becomes very small, its temperature approaches infinity.\n\nTo find the temperature dependence on the mass and properties of the black hole, we can analyze the Hawking temperature formula. The temperature is inversely proportional to the mass (T ∝ 1/M), meaning that as the mass decreases, the temperature increases. The other constants in the formula (ħ, c, G, and k_B) are fundamental constants of nature and do not depend on the properties of the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the maximum temperature a black hole can attain before it completely evaporates due to Hawking radiation is when its mass becomes very small, and its temperature approaches infinity. The temperature of a black hole depends on its mass, with the relationship being inversely proportional (T ∝ 1/M)."
