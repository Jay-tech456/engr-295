    "message_1": "A ray of light travels from air into an acrylic block at an incident angle of 40 degrees. Find the critical angle for the interface between the acrylic and air, assuming the refractive index of acrylic to be 1.5.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for the interface between the acrylic and air, we can use Snell's Law. Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of acrylic (1.5), and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1). The critical angle (θc) occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.\n\n1.5 * sin(θc) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.5 * sin(θc) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θc):\n\nsin(θc) = 1 / 1.5\nθc = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nThe critical angle for the interface between the acrylic and air is approximately 41.81 degrees."
