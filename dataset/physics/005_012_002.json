    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the speed of the object (0.8c in this case).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1) * 500 kg * c^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667 * 500 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667 * 500 kg * 9 * 10^16 J\nK.E. ≈ 3 * 10^17 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is approximately 3 * 10^17 Joules."
