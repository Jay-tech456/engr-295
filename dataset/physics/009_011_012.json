    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's Equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n₁/n₂ - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂)\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, n₁ is the refractive index of the lens material, n₂ is the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and R₁ and R₂ are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.\n\nTo find the focal length (f), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nf = 1 / [(n₁/n₂ - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂)]\n\nBy plugging in the given values for n₁, n₂, R₁, and R₂, we can calculate the focal length of the lens."
