    "message_1": "A long coaxial cable of radius R has an inner wire of radius r carrying a current I in the positive x-direction. Find the magnetic field at a distance r < b < R from the center of the cable. Determine the direction of the magnetic field at that point. Also, calculate the magnetic field at a point outside the coaxial cable, at a distance greater than R from its center.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance r < b < R from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field B around a closed loop is equal to μ₀ times the total current enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, we can choose a circular Amperian loop of radius b, centered on the cable's axis. The magnetic field B will be tangential to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral simplifies to:\n\nB * 2πb = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nTo find the enclosed current, we need to determine the current density within the inner wire. Since the current I is uniformly distributed over the inner wire's cross-sectional area, the current density J is:\n\nJ = I / (πr²)\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current by multiplying the current density by the area enclosed by the Amperian loop:\n\nI_enclosed = J * πb² = (I / πr²) * πb² = I * (b² / r²)\n\nSubstituting this into Ampere's Law, we get:\n\nB * 2πb = μ₀I * (b² / r²)\n\nSolving for B, we find the magnetic field at a distance r < b < R from the center of the cable:\n\nB = (μ₀I / 2π) * (b / r²)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (positive x-direction), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. So, the magnetic field will be in the azimuthal direction, tangent to the Amperian loop.\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field at a point outside the coaxial cable, at a distance greater than R from its center. In this case, the Amperian loop of radius b > R encloses the entire current I. Applying Ampere's Law again:\n\nB * 2πb = μ₀I\n\nSolving for B, we find the magnetic field at a distance greater than R from the center of the cable:\n\nB = μ₀I / (2πb)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is still in the azimuthal direction, tangent to the Amperian loop, as determined by the right-hand rule."
