    "message_1": "A thermodynamic system undergoes an isothermal expansion at a constant temperature of 500 K, during which it releases 1500 J of heat to the surroundings. The final volume of the system is 0.05 m³ and its initial volume was 0.02 m³. Determine the entropy change of the system during this process.",
    "message_2": "To determine the entropy change of the system during this isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = Q/T\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, Q is the heat exchanged, and T is the temperature.\n\nSince the system releases 1500 J of heat to the surroundings, the heat exchanged is -1500 J (negative because it's released). The temperature is given as 500 K.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔS = (-1500 J) / (500 K)\n\nΔS = -3 J/K\n\nThe entropy change of the system during this isothermal expansion is -3 J/K."
