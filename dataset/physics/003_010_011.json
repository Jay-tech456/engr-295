    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nAmpere's Law: ∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is symmetrical and circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius of 5 cm (0.05 m) centered on the wire as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field (B) is tangent to the loop at every point, so B⋅dl = Bdlcos(0) = Bdl, since the angle between B and dl is 0 degrees.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for our chosen loop:\n\n∮Bdl = B∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field (B) is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe integral of dl around the loop is equal to the circumference of the loop (2πr), where r is the radius of the loop (0.05 m):\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current (I) is given as 3 A, and the radius (r) is 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 3 A) / (2π × 0.05 m)\n\nThe Amperes (A) cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm × 3) / (2 × 0.05 m)\n\nB = (6π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 60π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 1.885 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the cylinder is approximately 1.885 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
