    "message_2": "To find the latent heat of fusion of ice, we need to calculate the total amount of heat required to change the ice at -10°C to liquid water at 10°C. This process involves three steps:\n\n1. Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C.\n2. Melting the ice at 0°C.\n3. Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 10°C.\n\nLet's calculate the heat required for each step:\n\nStep 1: Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C\nQ1 = mass x specific heat capacity of ice x temperature change\nQ1 = 100 g x 2.06 J/g°C x (0°C - (-10°C))\nQ1 = 100 g x 2.06 J/g°C x 10°C\nQ1 = 2060 J\n\nStep 2: Melting the ice at 0°C\nLet L be the latent heat of fusion of ice, and Q2 be the heat required to melt the ice.\nQ2 = mass x L\nQ2 = 100 g x L\n\nStep 3: Heating the liquid water from 0°C to 10°C\nQ3 = mass x specific heat capacity of water x temperature change\nQ3 = 100 g x 4.18 J/g°C x (10°C - 0°C)\nQ3 = 100 g x 4.18 J/g°C x 10°C\nQ3 = 4180 J\n\nNow, let's find the total heat required (Q_total) for the entire process:\nQ_total = Q1 + Q2 + Q3\nQ_total = 2060 J + 100 g x L + 4180 J\n\nWe are given that the total heat required is 3340 J (100 g of ice at -10°C is heated until it becomes liquid water at 10°C). Therefore,\n\n3340 J = 2060 J + 100 g x L + 4180 J\n\nNow, we can solve for L (latent heat of fusion of ice):\n\n100 g x L = 3340 J - 2060 J - 4180 J\n100 g x L = -2900 J\nL = -2900 J / 100 g\nL = -29 J/g\n\nHowever, the latent heat of fusion should be a positive value. It seems there might be an error in the given information (total heat required). Please double-check the given information and ensure it is correct."
