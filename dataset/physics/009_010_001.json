    "message_2": "To find the magnification produced by a convex lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the lens (10 cm)\nu = object distance from the lens (-20 cm, negative because the object is on the left side of the lens)\nv = image distance from the lens (which we need to find)\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/20\n1/v = 2/20 + 1/20\n1/v = 3/20\nv = 20/3 cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nPlugging the values:\nm = -(20/3) / (-20)\nm = (20/3) / 20\n\nSolving for m:\nm = 1/3\n\nThe magnification produced by the convex lens is 1/3 or 0.33, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object."
