    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between two energy levels (n=3 and n=5) in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=3 level:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=5 level:\n\nE_5 = -13.6 eV / 5^2 = -13.6 eV / 25 ≈ -0.544 eV\n\nFinally, let's find the energy difference between these two levels:\n\nΔE = E_5 - E_3 = -0.544 eV - (-1.51 eV) = 1.51 eV - 0.544 eV ≈ 0.966 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the n=3 and n=5 levels in a hydrogen atom is approximately 0.966 eV."
