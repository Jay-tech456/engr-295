    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the rod, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long, straight rod carrying a current, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the rod. We can choose a circular path of radius r (4 cm in this case) centered on the rod as our loop. The magnetic field is tangent to this loop at every point, so the dot product B⋅dl simplifies to B * dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for this situation:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular path, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe integral of dl around the circular path is just the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nWe are given the current I = 2.5 A, and the distance from the center of the rod r = 4 cm = 0.04 m. The permeability of free space μ₀ is a constant, approximately equal to 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.04\n\nB ≈ 6.25 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the rod is approximately 6.25 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
