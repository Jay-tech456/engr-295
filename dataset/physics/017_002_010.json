    "message_2": "At the atomic level, the magnetic properties of iron are primarily determined by the alignment of the electron spins in its atoms. Iron is a ferromagnetic material, which means that its atoms have unpaired electrons with their spins aligned in parallel, creating a net magnetic moment. This alignment of spins is due to the exchange interaction between the electrons.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the thermal energy in the iron lattice also increases. This added thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate more, which can disrupt the alignment of the electron spins. When the temperature reaches a certain critical point, known as the Curie temperature (Tc), the thermal energy becomes strong enough to overcome the exchange interaction, and the electron spins become randomly oriented. At this point, the ferromagnetic properties of iron are lost, and it becomes paramagnetic.\n\nFor iron, the Curie temperature is around 770Â°C (1043 K). Below this temperature, the magnetic moments of the atoms tend to align themselves parallel to an external magnetic field, creating a strong magnetic response. Above the Curie temperature, the magnetic moments become randomly oriented, and the magnetic response is much weaker.\n\nIn summary, as the temperature increases, the magnetic properties of iron are weakened due to the increased thermal energy disrupting the alignment of electron spins. When the temperature reaches the Curie temperature, the ferromagnetic properties of iron are lost, and it becomes paramagnetic."
