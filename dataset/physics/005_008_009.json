    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at 0.8c relative to an observer on Earth. The spaceship's clock shows that 10 years have passed during the journey. How much time has passed for the observer on Earth, and what will be the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth? Use the Lorentz transformations of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Lorentz transformations for time dilation and length contraction. \n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, let's find the time dilation. The time passed for the observer on Earth (t') can be found using the formula:\n\nt' = γ * t\n\nwhere t is the time passed on the spaceship's clock (10 years).\n\nt' = 1.667 * 10\nt' ≈ 16.67 years\n\nSo, for the observer on Earth, approximately 16.67 years have passed.\n\nNext, let's find the length contraction. If the proper length of the spaceship (L) is given, we can find the length as measured by the observer on Earth (L') using the formula:\n\nL' = L / γ\n\nHowever, since the proper length of the spaceship is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact contracted length L'. But we can say that the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth would be shorter than its proper length by a factor of γ (≈ 1.667).\n\nIn summary, for the observer on Earth, approximately 16.67 years have passed, and the length of the spaceship would be shorter than its proper length by a factor of approximately 1.667."
