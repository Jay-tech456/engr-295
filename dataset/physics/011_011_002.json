    "message_2": "To investigate the piezoelectric effect in a quartz crystal, we need to understand the piezoelectric properties of quartz and how they relate to the crystal's dimensions and the applied force.\n\nQuartz is a piezoelectric material, meaning that it generates an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect in quartz is primarily due to the displacement of its SiO4 tetrahedra when subjected to stress. The piezoelectric coefficients of quartz are represented by the matrix d_ij, where i and j are indices representing the directions of the applied stress and the resulting electric field, respectively.\n\nFor a quartz crystal, the relevant piezoelectric coefficients are d11, d12, d13, d14, d15, and d33. In this problem, we are asked to determine the piezoelectric coefficient d11 and the electric fields generated when a constant force of 1 N is applied along the [001] direction of the crystal.\n\nFirst, let's find the piezoelectric coefficient d11. For quartz, the value of d11 is approximately 2.3 pC/N (picocoulombs per newton). This value is a material property and is independent of the crystal's dimensions.\n\nNow, let's determine the electric fields generated when a constant force of 1 N is applied along the [001] direction of the crystal. To do this, we need to use the piezoelectric equation:\n\nE_i = d_ij * T_j\n\nwhere E_i is the electric field in the i-direction, d_ij is the piezoelectric coefficient, and T_j is the stress in the j-direction.\n\nSince the force is applied along the [001] direction, the stress T_3 = F/A, where F is the applied force and A is the area of the crystal's face perpendicular to the force. In this case, A = 2 cm * 2 cm = 4 cm² = 4 * 10^(-4) m².\n\nSo, T_3 = 1 N / (4 * 10^(-4) m²) = 2500 N/m².\n\nNow, we can calculate the electric fields E_1 and E_2 using the piezoelectric coefficients d11 and d12, respectively:\n\nE_1 = d11 * T_3 = 2.3 * 10^(-12) C/N * 2500 N/m² = 5.75 * 10^(-9) V/m\nE_2 = d12 * T_3 = 0 (since d12 = 0 for quartz)\n\nThus, the electric fields generated when a constant force of 1 N is applied along the [001] direction of the crystal are E_1 = 5.75 * 10^(-9) V/m and E_2 = 0 V/m."
