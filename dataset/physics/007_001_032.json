    "message_2": "To find the energy released in the nuclear fusion reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nE = Δm * c²\n\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the change in mass, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in mass (Δm). Since 0.03 of the total mass is converted to energy, we have:\n\nΔm = 0.03 * (mass of deuterium + mass of tritium)\nΔm = 0.03 * (10 g + 10 g)\nΔm = 0.03 * 20 g\nΔm = 0.6 g\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass from grams to kilograms:\n\nΔm = 0.6 g * (1 kg / 1000 g)\nΔm = 0.0006 kg\n\nNow we can find the energy released:\n\nE = Δm * c²\nE = 0.0006 kg * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)²\nE = 0.0006 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m²/s²\nE = 5.4 x 10^13 J\n\nSo, the amount of energy released in the nuclear fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium when 10 grams of each element react is 5.4 x 10^13 Joules."
