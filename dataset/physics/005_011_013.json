    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the proton, we need to use the following formula:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass of the proton, v is the speed of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.8c\nc = 3.00 x 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, we need to find v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.8c)^2 / c^2 = 0.64c^2 / c^2 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNext, we find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 2.78 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton traveling at 0.8c is approximately 2.78 x 10^-27 kg."
