    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the spaceship is traveling at 0.8 times the speed of light, we have:\n\nv = 0.8 * c\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8 * c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1) * 10,000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667 * 10,000 kg * 9 * 10^16 J/kg\nK.E. ≈ 6 * 10^4 * 9 * 10^16 J\nK.E. ≈ 5.4 * 10^21 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 5.4 * 10^21 Joules."
