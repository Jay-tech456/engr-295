    "message_2": "The evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from various astrophysical observations that suggest the presence of unseen mass in the universe. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. The observed lensing effects often require more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of roughly 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, where the visible matter (mostly in the form of hot gas) has been separated from the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing). This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, which does not interact with the gas and remains spatially separated.\n\nDark matter fits into the Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics because it is not accounted for by the particles and forces described in the Standard Model of particle physics. The nature of dark matter remains unknown, and several BSM theories propose new particles and interactions that could explain its properties. Some of the leading dark matter candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): These hypothetical particles interact with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity, making them difficult to detect. WIMPs are predicted in several BSM theories, such as supersymmetry.\n\n2. Axions: These are light, neutral particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They could also serve as dark matter candidates if they are sufficiently abundant and stable.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: These hypothetical particles are similar to the known neutrinos but do not interact through the weak nuclear force, making them even more elusive. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the dark matter density.\n\n4. Self-interacting dark matter: This class of models proposes that dark matter particles interact with each other through a new force, which could help explain some of the observed properties of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nExperimental searches for dark matter particles are ongoing, using techniques such as direct detection experiments, indirect detection through cosmic rays, and searches for new particles at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider. The discovery of dark matter would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and could provide crucial insights into the nature of BSM physics."
