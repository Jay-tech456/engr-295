    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section, we can use the Mott formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z * e² / (4 * π * ε₀ * E))² * (1 / sin^4(θ/2)) * (1 - β² * sin²(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\nσ(θ) is the Mott scattering cross section\nZ is the atomic number of the target (Aluminum, Z = 13)\ne is the elementary charge (e = 1.602 × 10^(-19) C)\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (ε₀ = 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm²)\nE is the energy of the incident electrons (E = 100 MeV = 100 × 10^6 eV)\nθ is the scattering angle (θ = 30°)\nβ is the ratio of the electron's velocity to the speed of light (v/c)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the electron's velocity (v) and the ratio β:\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is given by:\n\nE² = (m₀ * c²)² + (p * c)²\n\nwhere:\nE is the total energy of the electron\nm₀ is the rest mass of the electron (m₀ = 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nc is the speed of light (c = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\np is the momentum of the electron\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for p:\n\np = sqrt((E² - (m₀ * c²)²) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\np = sqrt(((100 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV)² - (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg * (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²)²) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²)\n\np ≈ 3.517 × 10^(-22) kg m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the velocity (v) using the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = m₀ * v / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for v:\n\nv = p * sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) / m₀\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use an iterative method or a numerical solver to find v:\n\nv ≈ 2.872 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio β:\n\nβ = v / c\n\nβ ≈ 2.872 × 10^8 m/s / 2.998 × 10^8 m/s\n\nβ ≈ 0.958\n\nNow, we can calculate the Mott scattering cross section using the Mott formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (13 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)² / (4 * π * 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm² * 100 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV))² * (1 / sin^4(30°/2)) * (1 - 0.958² * sin²(30°/2))\n\nσ(θ) ≈ 1.184 × 10^(-30) m²\n\nThe Mott scattering cross section for a beam of electrons with an energy of 100 MeV incident on an aluminum atom at a scattering angle of 30° is approximately 1.184 × 10^(-30) m²."
