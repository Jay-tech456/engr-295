    "message_1": "What is the likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life in the Milky Way galaxy based on current astrophysical knowledge? How many potentially habitable exoplanets are estimated to exist in the Milky Way and what are the characteristics of those planets that make them conducive to supporting life? By analyzing current telescopic and spectroscopic data, what criteria can be used to identify habitable exoplanets and what methods are being developed to detect biosignatures that may indicate the presence of life on these exoplanets?",
    "message_2": "The likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life in the Milky Way galaxy is difficult to quantify precisely, but the discovery of numerous exoplanets in recent years has increased the probability of finding life beyond Earth. According to some estimates, there could be billions of potentially habitable exoplanets in our galaxy alone.\n\nPotentially habitable exoplanets are those that reside within the habitable zone (also known as the \"Goldilocks zone\") of their host star, where conditions might be just right for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. This is a crucial factor for life as we know it. Other characteristics that make a planet conducive to supporting life include a rocky composition, a stable orbit, and a suitable atmosphere.\n\nTo identify habitable exoplanets, astronomers use a combination of telescopic and spectroscopic data. Telescopes like the Kepler Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detect exoplanets by observing the slight dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it, known as the transit method. Spectroscopy is then used to analyze the star's light to determine the planet's size, mass, and atmospheric composition.\n\nMethods being developed to detect biosignatures, or signs of life, on these exoplanets include analyzing their atmospheres for the presence of gases like oxygen, methane, and water vapor, which could indicate biological activity. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to perform these detailed atmospheric analyses, significantly advancing our search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nIn summary, while it is difficult to assign a specific likelihood to the discovery of extraterrestrial life in the Milky Way, the increasing number of potentially habitable exoplanets and advancements in detection methods make the prospect more promising than ever before."
