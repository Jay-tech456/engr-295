    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), which is just a few degrees above absolute zero. This radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and fills the entire universe. It was first discovered in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who later received the Nobel Prize for their discovery.\n\nThe CMB temperature varies very slightly across the universe, with fluctuations on the order of about 1 part in 100,000. These tiny variations were first detected by the COBE satellite in the early 1990s and have since been measured with increasing precision by other missions, such as the WMAP and Planck satellites. The temperature fluctuations are usually represented as a map of the sky, showing the minute differences in temperature from one point to another.\n\nThese small variations in the CMB temperature provide us with valuable information about the early universe. They are the result of tiny density fluctuations in the early universe, which later grew into the large-scale structures we see today, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. By studying the pattern of these fluctuations, physicists can learn about the initial conditions of the universe, its composition, and the processes that took place during its early stages.\n\nFor example, the CMB data has allowed us to determine the age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), the density of ordinary matter and dark matter, and the rate of expansion of the universe. It has also provided strong evidence for the theory of cosmic inflation, which posits that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This theory helps to explain the uniformity of the CMB temperature across the sky and the observed distribution of large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the cosmic microwave background radiation has a temperature of about 2.725 K, with tiny variations across the universe. These variations give us crucial insights into the early universe, its composition, and the processes that shaped its evolution."
