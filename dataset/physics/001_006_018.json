    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, electrons are fired at a barrier with two slits, and their positions are recorded on a screen behind the barrier. The probability distribution of electrons forming an interference pattern on the screen can be described using the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nWhen both slits are open, the probability distribution of electrons is given by the square of the absolute value of the sum of the wave functions associated with each slit. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(x) = |Ψ1(x) + Ψ2(x)|^2\n\nHere, Ψ1(x) and Ψ2(x) are the wave functions corresponding to the electrons passing through slit 1 and slit 2, respectively. The interference pattern observed on the screen is a result of the constructive and destructive interference of these wave functions.\n\nWhen one of the slits is closed, the probability distribution changes. Let's say slit 2 is closed; in this case, the probability distribution will be given by:\n\nP(x) = |Ψ1(x)|^2\n\nNow, the interference pattern disappears, and the distribution on the screen resembles the pattern expected from a single slit experiment. This is because there is no wave function from the second slit to interfere with the wave function from the first slit.\n\nThe observed effects can be explained in the context of quantum mechanics through the principle of superposition and wave-particle duality. Electrons, like other particles, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. In the double-slit experiment, the wave-like nature of electrons is evident in the interference pattern formed on the screen when both slits are open. The principle of superposition states that the total wave function of a system is the sum of the individual wave functions, which is why the interference pattern is observed.\n\nHowever, when one slit is closed, the electrons can only pass through the remaining open slit, and their particle-like nature becomes more apparent. The interference pattern disappears, and the probability distribution on the screen corresponds to that of a single slit experiment.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability distribution of electrons in a double-slit experiment depends on whether both slits are open or one is closed. The observed effects can be explained by the wave-particle duality of electrons and the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics."
