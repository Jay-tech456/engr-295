    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point due to the difference in curvature of the lens at different points. This results in a blurry image. To calculate the diameter of the circle of least confusion, we can use the formula:\n\nD = (8 * d^3 * h) / (3 * f^4)\n\nwhere D is the diameter of the circle of least confusion, d is the diameter of the lens, h is the distance of the object from the lens, and f is the focal length of the lens.\n\nGiven the values:\nd = 2 cm\nh = 40 cm\nf = 10 cm\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nD = (8 * (2)^3 * 40) / (3 * (10)^4)\nD = (8 * 8 * 40) / (3 * 10000)\nD = 2560 / 30000\nD = 0.0853 cm\n\nThe diameter of the circle of least confusion is approximately 0.0853 cm.\n\nNow, let's determine the magnification of the image formed. The magnification (M) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM = - (f / (f - h))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nM = - (10 / (10 - 40))\nM = - (10 / (-30))\nM = 1/3\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is 1/3, meaning the image is one-third the size of the object."
