    "message_1": "A beam of unpolarized light is incident on a polarizer with an angle of incidence of 60 degrees. The polarizer is rotated, and the intensity of light passing through the polarizer is measured for various angles of rotation. The intensity of the transmitted light is found to be 50% of the incident light when the polarizer is rotated by 30 degrees. What is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis and the direction of polarization of the incident light.\n\nMathematically, Malus' Law can be expressed as:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis and the direction of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the intensity of the transmitted light is 50% of the incident light when the polarizer is rotated by 30 degrees. Therefore, we can write:\n\n0.5 * I_incident = I_incident * cos^2(θ)\n\nDividing both sides by I_incident, we get:\n\n0.5 = cos^2(θ)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine:\n\nθ = arccos(1/sqrt(2))\n\nθ ≈ 45 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the direction of polarization of the incident light is approximately 45 degrees."
