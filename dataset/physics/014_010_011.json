    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 10 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass into kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so 10 solar masses would be:\n\nM = 10 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.989 × 10^31 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 × 1.989 × 10^31) / 9 × 10^16\n\nr_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 29.5 kilometers."
