    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and orientation of the image formed by the converging lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance (distance between the object and the lens), and v is the image distance (distance between the image and the lens).\n\nGiven, the focal length f = 30 cm and the object distance u = -20 cm (negative sign indicates the object is on the left side of the lens). We can now solve for the image distance v:\n\n1/30 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying all terms by 60 (the least common multiple of 30 and 20):\n\n2 = -3 + 60/v\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n60/v = 5\n\nNow, solving for v:\n\nv = 60/5 = 12 cm\n\nSince the value of v is positive, the image is formed on the right side of the lens (real image).\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12/(-20)\n\nM = 0.6\n\nThe magnification is 0.6, which means the image is smaller than the object (since M < 1). The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted compared to the object.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the converging lens is 12 cm to the right of the lens, it is smaller in size (0.6 times the object size), and it is inverted."
