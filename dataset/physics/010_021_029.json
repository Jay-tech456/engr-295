    "message_2": "To find the average fluid velocity in the chamber, we need to use the formula:\n\nAverage velocity = Flow rate / Cross-sectional area\n\nFirst, we need to convert the flow rate from μL/min to a more suitable unit, such as m³/s. \n\n1 μL = 1 x 10^(-9) L = 1 x 10^(-12) m³\n5 μL/min = 5 x 10^(-12) m³/min\n\n1 min = 60 s\n5 μL/min = (5 x 10^(-12) m³/min) * (1 min / 60 s) = 8.333 x 10^(-14) m³/s\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area of the chamber:\n\nWidth = 100 μm = 100 x 10^(-6) m\nHeight = 50 μm = 50 x 10^(-6) m\n\nCross-sectional area = Width x Height = (100 x 10^(-6) m) * (50 x 10^(-6) m) = 5 x 10^(-9) m²\n\nNow, we can find the average fluid velocity:\n\nAverage velocity = (8.333 x 10^(-14) m³/s) / (5 x 10^(-9) m²) = 1.666 x 10^(-5) m/s\n\nSo, the average fluid velocity in the chamber is 1.666 x 10^(-5) m/s."
