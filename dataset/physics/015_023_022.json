    "message_2": "The expected rate of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers in the universe is still uncertain due to the lack of observational evidence and the limited understanding of their formation mechanisms. IMBHs are black holes with masses in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses. They are thought to form through various processes, such as the runaway collision of massive stars in dense stellar clusters or the hierarchical merging of smaller black holes.\n\nEstimates for the merger rate of IMBHs vary widely, ranging from less than 1 to several hundred per gigaparsec-cubed per year (Gpc^-3 yr^-1). The actual rate depends on several factors, such as the initial mass function of stars, the density of the stellar environment, and the efficiency of the black hole formation processes.\n\nThe detectability of gravitational waves from IMBH mergers depends on the sensitivity of the gravitational wave observatories. Currently, the LIGO and Virgo observatories have detected gravitational waves from stellar-mass black hole mergers, but they have not yet observed any IMBH mergers. The sensitivity of these observatories is limited at the lower frequency range, where IMBH mergers are expected to produce stronger signals.\n\nFuture gravitational wave observatories, such as the planned space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are expected to have better sensitivity in the lower frequency range, making them more suitable for detecting IMBH mergers. LISA is expected to be sensitive to IMBH mergers with masses up to 10^5 solar masses at redshifts up to z~10. This increased sensitivity will allow for a better understanding of the IMBH merger rate and the underlying astrophysical processes.\n\nIn summary, the expected rate of IMBH mergers in the universe is still uncertain, but future gravitational wave observatories like LISA will likely improve our understanding of these events and their detectability."
