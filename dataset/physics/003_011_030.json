    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 2 cm above the center of the copper disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the disc, we can consider a small circular strip of radius x and thickness dx on the disc. The length of this strip is the circumference, which is 2πx. The area of the strip is dA = 2πx dx, and the current flowing through this strip is dI = (I * dA) / A, where A is the total area of the disc (πR^2, with R = 5 cm).\n\nNow, the magnetic field dB at the point 2 cm above the center of the disc due to this strip is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πx dx) / (x^2 + z^2)^(3/2)\n\nwhere z = 2 cm is the height above the disc. Integrating this expression over the entire disc (from x = 0 to x = R) will give the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = ∫(0 to R) [(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * 2πx dx) / (πR^2 * (x^2 + z^2)^(3/2))]\n\nLet's plug in the values and solve the integral:\n\nB = ∫(0 to 5) [(4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * 2πx dx) / (π * 25 cm^2 * (x^2 + 4 cm^2)^(3/2))]\n\nB = (24π × 10^(-7) / 25) ∫(0 to 5) [x dx / (x^2 + 4)^(3/2)]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = x^2 + 4, then du = 2x dx:\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) / 25) ∫(0 to 29) [du / u^(3/2)]\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) / 25) * [-2 * u^(-1/2)] evaluated from 0 to 29\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) / 25) * [-2 * (29^(-1/2) - 4^(-1/2))]\n\nB ≈ 1.22 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 2 cm above the center of the copper disc is approximately 1.22 × 10^(-7) T (Tesla)."
