    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section (σ) can be calculated using the Mott formula, which is given by:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e²)² / (16 * π * ε₀² * E * (1 - cos(θ))^2 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the two interacting particles (Z₁ = 3 for lithium, Z₂ = 2 for an alpha particle)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²)\n- E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle (20 keV = 20 x 10^3 eV)\n- θ is the scattering angle\n\nTo find the scattering angle for the most probable scattering event, we need to find the angle at which the differential cross section (dσ/dΩ) is maximum. The differential cross section can be obtained by differentiating the Mott formula with respect to the solid angle (Ω):\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e²)² / (16 * π * ε₀² * E * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ at which dσ/dΩ is maximum. To do this, we can differentiate dσ/dΩ with respect to θ and set the result equal to zero:\n\nd(dσ/dΩ)/dθ = 0\n\nSolving this equation for θ will give us the most probable scattering angle. However, this is a complex mathematical problem that requires advanced calculus techniques. Instead, we can use numerical methods or software tools like Mathematica or MATLAB to find the most probable scattering angle.\n\nOnce we have the most probable scattering angle, we can plug it back into the Mott formula to find the corresponding Mott scattering cross section."
