    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire, also known as the Biot-Savart Law. The formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * r²) / (2 * (r² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current (2 A),\nN is the number of turns (100),\nr is the radius of the inductor (0.05 m),\nx is the distance from the center of the inductor (0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 100 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 100 * 0.0025 m²) / ((0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-5) Tm/A) / (0.0125 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-5) Tm/A) / (0.0125 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB ≈ 1.13 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor is approximately 1.13 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
