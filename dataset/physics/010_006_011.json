Determine, in kPa, the total pressure acting on the bottom of the tank when it is completely filled with water. Given, the density of water is 1000 kg/m³ and atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kPa.",
    "message_2": "To determine the total pressure acting on the bottom of the tank, we need to consider both the pressure due to the weight of the water and the atmospheric pressure.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the tank:\nVolume = length × width × depth\nVolume = 2 m × 1 m × 3 m = 6 m³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the water in the tank:\nMass = volume × density\nMass = 6 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ = 6000 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the water:\nWeight = mass × gravitational acceleration\nWeight = 6000 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 58860 N\n\nNow, let's find the area of the bottom of the tank:\nArea = length × width\nArea = 2 m × 1 m = 2 m²\n\nNow, we can find the pressure due to the weight of the water:\nPressure_water = Weight / Area\nPressure_water = 58860 N / 2 m² = 29430 N/m² = 29.43 kPa\n\nFinally, we can find the total pressure acting on the bottom of the tank by adding the atmospheric pressure:\nTotal pressure = Pressure_water + Atmospheric pressure\nTotal pressure = 29.43 kPa + 101.3 kPa = 130.73 kPa\n\nSo, the total pressure acting on the bottom of the tank when it is completely filled with water is 130.73 kPa."
