    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit or absorb light or any other electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible and undetectable directly. However, there is substantial evidence for the existence of dark matter based on its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Some of the key evidence for dark matter includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: According to General Relativity, massive objects can bend light due to their gravitational influence. Observations of gravitational lensing, where the light from distant galaxies is bent around massive galaxy clusters, indicate that there is more mass present in these clusters than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is influenced by the presence of dark matter. The observed pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the existence of dark matter and provides constraints on its properties.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Dark matter acts as a gravitational scaffold, allowing visible matter to clump together and form the large-scale structures we observe today. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match observations.\n\nGeneral Relativity plays a crucial role in our understanding of dark matter. As a theory of gravity, it describes how massive objects like dark matter can influence the curvature of spacetime and thus affect the motion of visible matter and light. Gravitational lensing, as mentioned earlier, is a direct consequence of General Relativity and provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nMoreover, General Relativity is the foundation of our current understanding of cosmology and the evolution of the universe. It allows us to model the large-scale structure formation and the behavior of the CMB radiation, both of which are influenced by dark matter. By incorporating dark matter into these models, we can better understand its properties and its role in the evolution of the universe.\n\nIn summary, while dark matter has not been directly detected, its existence is strongly supported by various lines of evidence that rely on its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. General Relativity plays a crucial role in our understanding of these effects and the behavior of dark matter in the universe."
