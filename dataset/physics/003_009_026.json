    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a solid conducting sphere carrying a steady current 'I', we can use Ampere's law. However, it's important to note that the current must be uniformly distributed across the sphere's volume for this analysis.\n\nAmpere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I):\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a solid conducting sphere, the current is uniformly distributed across its volume. To find the current enclosed by a smaller sphere of radius 'r' within the larger sphere, we can use the ratio of their volumes:\n\nI_enclosed = I * (4/3πr^3) / (4/3πR^3) = I * (r^3 / R^3)\n\nNow, let's consider a circular loop of radius 'r' centered at the sphere's center. The magnetic field (B) is tangential to the loop, and its magnitude is constant along the loop. Thus, the line integral becomes:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nApplying Ampere's law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I * (r^3 / R^3)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r^2) / (2π * R^3)\n\nAt the center of the sphere (r = 0), the magnetic field B is:\n\nB_center = (μ₀ * I * 0^2) / (2π * R^3) = 0\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of a solid conducting sphere carrying a steady current 'I' is 0."
