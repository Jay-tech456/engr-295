And how does changing the tension and characteristic length affect the detectability of gravitational waves by LISA?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a cosmic string network, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f) of gravitational waves produced by a cosmic string loop is given by:\nf ≈ (c / L) * (G * μ / c^2)^1/2\n\n2. Amplitude (h) of gravitational waves produced by a cosmic string loop is given by:\nh ≈ (G * μ / c^2) * (L / d)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, μ is the linear mass density (tension) of the cosmic string, L is the characteristic length of the cosmic string loop, and d is the distance to the cosmic string loop.\n\nGiven the tension T = 10^16 GeV, we first need to convert it to mass units (kg). Using the conversion factor 1 GeV/c^2 ≈ 1.783 × 10^-36 kg, we get:\n\nμ = T * (1.783 × 10^-36 kg/GeV) ≈ 1.783 × 10^-20 kg/m\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a cosmic string loop with a characteristic length of 1 km (L = 10^3 m) and a distance d = 10^21 m (roughly 100 Mpc, a typical distance for LISA's sensitivity range):\n\nf ≈ (3 × 10^8 m/s / 10^3 m) * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 1.783 × 10^-20 kg/m / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2)^1/2 ≈ 2.7 × 10^-4 Hz\n\nh ≈ (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 1.783 × 10^-20 kg/m / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2) * (10^3 m / 10^21 m) ≈ 6.7 × 10^-23\n\nSo, the expected frequency of gravitational waves produced by this cosmic string network is approximately 2.7 × 10^-4 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 6.7 × 10^-23.\n\nNow, let's discuss how changing the tension and characteristic length affects the detectability of gravitational waves by LISA:\n\n1. Increasing the tension (μ) will increase both the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves. Higher tension leads to stronger gravitational waves, which are easier to detect. However, if the frequency increases too much, it may fall outside of LISA's sensitive frequency range (approximately 10^-4 Hz to 10^-1 Hz).\n\n2. Increasing the characteristic length (L) will decrease the frequency of the gravitational waves while increasing their amplitude. Longer cosmic string loops produce lower frequency gravitational waves with larger amplitudes. If the frequency falls within LISA's sensitive range, increasing the amplitude will improve the detectability of the gravitational waves.\n\nIn summary, the detectability of gravitational waves by LISA depends on both the tension and characteristic length of the cosmic string network. Higher tension and longer loops generally lead to stronger gravitational waves, which are easier to detect, as long as the frequency remains within LISA's sensitive range."
