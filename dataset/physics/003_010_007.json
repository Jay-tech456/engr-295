    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point outside a long cylindrical wire carrying a steady current, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀ * I\n\nFor a long cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire, and its magnitude is the same at all points on a circle with a fixed radius. Therefore, we can choose a circular loop with a radius equal to the distance from the point to the center of the cylinder (10 cm) as our Amperian loop.\n\nLet's denote the radius of the cylinder as r1 (0.5 cm) and the distance from the point to the center of the cylinder as r2 (10 cm). The magnetic field at a point outside the cylinder can be found using the following formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the given point outside the long cylindrical wire is 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
