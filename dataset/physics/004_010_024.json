    "message_2": "The event horizon radius for a non-rotating black hole of mass M described by the Schwarzschild metric is given by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nAs the mass of the black hole (M) increases, the event horizon radius (Rs) will also increase proportionally. This means that if the mass of the black hole doubles, the event horizon radius will also double."
