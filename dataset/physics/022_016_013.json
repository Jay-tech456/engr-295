    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They have been proposed as a possible candidate for dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nThe mass range and mixing angle for sterile neutrinos to make up the entirety of dark matter are not precisely known, but there are some constraints based on experimental and observational data.\n\nMass Range:\nThe mass of sterile neutrinos should be in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) range to be considered as a viable dark matter candidate. This is because lighter sterile neutrinos (in the eV or meV range) would be too hot and would not form the observed large-scale structures in the universe. On the other hand, sterile neutrinos with masses in the GeV or TeV range would be too heavy and would overclose the universe. Therefore, the mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is typically considered to be between 1 keV and 50 keV.\n\nMixing Angle:\nThe mixing angle between sterile neutrinos and active neutrinos determines the production rate of sterile neutrinos in the early universe. A larger mixing angle would lead to a higher production rate, making it more likely for sterile neutrinos to make up the entirety of dark matter. However, a larger mixing angle also increases the decay rate of sterile neutrinos, which could produce X-ray signals that have not been observed. Based on current experimental and observational constraints, the mixing angle should be small, typically in the range of sin^2(2θ) ≲ 10^(-10) to 10^(-7).\n\nIt is important to note that these values are subject to change as new experimental and observational data become available. Additionally, there may be other dark matter candidates that could explain the observed phenomena in the universe, so it is not guaranteed that sterile neutrinos make up the entirety of dark matter."
