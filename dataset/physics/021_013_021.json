    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole can indeed affect the spectral shape and temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in its vicinity. This is primarily due to two key factors: gravitational lensing and the redshift effect.\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: A black hole has an immense gravitational pull, which can bend the path of light and other electromagnetic radiation, such as the CMB. This bending of light is known as gravitational lensing. When the CMB radiation passes near a black hole, its path is altered, causing the CMB photons to be focused or defocused. This can lead to anisotropies or fluctuations in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation in the vicinity of the black hole.\n\n2. Redshift effect: The strong gravitational field of a black hole can also cause a redshift in the CMB radiation. As the CMB photons move away from the black hole, they lose energy due to the gravitational pull, causing their wavelengths to become longer (redshifted). This redshift effect leads to a decrease in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation near the black hole.\n\nBoth of these effects can alter the spectral shape and temperature fluctuations of the CMB radiation in the vicinity of a black hole. However, it is important to note that these effects are generally small and localized, as the CMB radiation mostly originates from regions far away from black holes. The overall impact on the global properties of the CMB radiation is minimal, but these local effects can provide valuable information about the properties of black holes and their surrounding environments."
