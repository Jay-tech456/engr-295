    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the decay rate of a particle is determined by calculating the transition probability amplitude, also known as the Feynman amplitude, for the decay process. The decay rate, or width (Γ), is related to the lifetime (τ) of the particle by the following relation:\n\nΓ = ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTo calculate the decay rate, you need to consider the specific decay process and the corresponding Feynman diagrams. The amplitude for each diagram is calculated using the Feynman rules, which involve the particle's initial energy, mass, and other properties.\n\nOnce you have the amplitude, you can find the decay rate by squaring the amplitude and integrating over the phase space of the final state particles. This will give you the probability per unit time for the decay process to occur. The decay rate can then be related to the lifetime of the particle using the equation mentioned above.\n\nIn summary, to find the decay rate of a particle given its initial energy, mass, and lifetime, you need to:\n\n1. Identify the specific decay process and the corresponding Feynman diagrams.\n2. Calculate the amplitude for each diagram using the Feynman rules.\n3. Square the amplitude and integrate over the phase space of the final state particles to find the decay rate.\n4. Relate the decay rate to the lifetime using the equation Γ = ħ / τ."
