    "message_2": "To determine the minimum thickness of lead required to reduce the intensity of gamma radiation by 90%, we need to use the concept of half-value layer (HVL). The HVL is the thickness of a material required to reduce the intensity of radiation by half. For lead, the HVL depends on the energy of the gamma radiation. \n\nFor gamma radiation with an energy of 2.5 MeV, the HVL for lead is approximately 1.93 cm (you can find this value in tables or graphs of HVL vs. energy for different materials).\n\nNow, we want to reduce the intensity by 90%, which means we want to have only 10% of the initial intensity remaining. We can use the following formula:\n\nFinal intensity = Initial intensity * (1/2)^(thickness / HVL)\n\nWe want the final intensity to be 10% of the initial intensity, so:\n\n0.1 * Initial intensity = Initial intensity * (1/2)^(thickness / HVL)\n\n0.1 = (1/2)^(thickness / 1.93 cm)\n\nTo solve for the thickness, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.1) = (thickness / 1.93 cm) * log(1/2)\n\nthickness = 1.93 cm * (log(0.1) / log(1/2))\n\nthickness ≈ 6.44 cm\n\nSo, the minimum thickness of lead required to reduce the intensity of 2.5 MeV gamma radiation by 90% is approximately 6.44 cm."
