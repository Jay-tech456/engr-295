    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass and momentum of the proton, we first need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the following formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.95c) and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's find the value of v^2 / c^2:\n\nv^2 / c^2 = (0.95c)^2 / c^2 = 0.9025\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9025) ≈ 3.2026\n\nNext, we can find the relativistic mass (m') using the following formula:\n\nm' = γ * m₀\n\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass of the proton (1.67 x 10^-27 kg).\n\nm' = 3.2026 * (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) ≈ 5.3483 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow that we have the relativistic mass, we can find the relativistic momentum (p) using the following formula:\n\np = m' * v\n\np = (5.3483 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.95 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) ≈ 1.5236 x 10^-18 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton is approximately 5.3483 x 10^-27 kg, and its relativistic momentum is approximately 1.5236 x 10^-18 kg m/s."
