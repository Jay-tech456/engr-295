    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear magnetic dipole moment of an atom, we need to know the nuclear spin quantum number (I) and the nuclear magneton (μN). However, the information provided (mass number and atomic number) is not sufficient to determine the nuclear spin quantum number directly.\n\nThe atom in question is sodium-25 (25Na), with a mass number (A) of 25 and an atomic number (Z) of 11. Sodium-25 is an isotope of sodium, and its nuclear spin quantum number (I) can be found in nuclear physics databases or literature.\n\nA quick search reveals that the nuclear spin quantum number (I) for sodium-25 is 5/2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the nuclear magnetic dipole moment (μ) using the following formula:\n\nμ = g * μN * I\n\nwhere g is the nuclear g-factor (also known as the Landé g-factor), μN is the nuclear magneton, and I is the nuclear spin quantum number.\n\nThe nuclear magneton (μN) is a constant and is given by:\n\nμN = (e * ħ) / (2 * m_p)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.055 x 10^-34 J s), and m_p is the proton mass (1.673 x 10^-27 kg).\n\nHowever, we still need the nuclear g-factor (g) for sodium-25, which is also not provided. The g-factor is specific to each isotope and can be found in nuclear physics databases or literature.\n\nWithout the g-factor, we cannot calculate the nuclear magnetic dipole moment for sodium-25. If you can provide the g-factor, we can proceed with the calculation."
