    "message_1": "What is the latest measured top quark mass and how accurate is the measurement?",
    "message_2": "As of September 2021, the latest measured top quark mass is approximately 172.76 GeV/c², according to the Particle Data Group's 2020 update. The measurement has an uncertainty of about 0.30 GeV/c², which represents an accuracy of around 0.17%. This value is a combination of results from various experiments, including those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Tevatron. The top quark mass is a crucial parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics, and its precise determination is essential for understanding the properties of the Higgs boson and testing the consistency of the model."
