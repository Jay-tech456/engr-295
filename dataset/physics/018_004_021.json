    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, the probability of a Higgs boson decay into a specific final state is given by the ratio of the partial decay width for that final state to the total decay width of the Higgs boson. In this case, we are interested in the decay of the Higgs boson into a bottom quark-antiquark pair (b-bbar).\n\nThe partial decay width for the Higgs boson decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΓ(H → b-bbar) = (3 * GF * m_H^2 * m_b^2) / (4 * √2 * π)\n\nwhere:\n- Γ(H → b-bbar) is the partial decay width for the Higgs boson decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair\n- GF is the Fermi coupling constant, approximately 1.166 x 10^(-5) GeV^(-2)\n- m_H is the mass of the Higgs boson, 125 GeV/c²\n- m_b is the mass of the bottom quark, approximately 4.18 GeV/c²\n- 3 is a color factor, accounting for the three possible color combinations of the quark-antiquark pair\n\nPlugging in the known values, we get:\n\nΓ(H → b-bbar) ≈ (3 * 1.166 x 10^(-5) * (125)^2 * (4.18)^2) / (4 * √2 * π) ≈ 0.0031 GeV\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this decay mode, which is given by the ratio of the partial decay width to the total decay width:\n\nP(H → b-bbar) = Γ(H → b-bbar) / Γ_total\n\nGiven that the total decay width of the Higgs boson is 4.2 MeV/c², we first need to convert it to GeV:\n\nΓ_total = 4.2 MeV/c² * (1 GeV / 1000 MeV) = 0.0042 GeV\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(H → b-bbar) = 0.0031 GeV / 0.0042 GeV ≈ 0.738\n\nSo, the probability of a Higgs boson decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair is approximately 73.8% in the Standard Model framework."
