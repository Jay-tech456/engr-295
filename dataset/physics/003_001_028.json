    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point due to a straight wire carrying current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire lies along the y-axis, we can integrate the magnetic field contributions from each small current element along the wire. Let's consider a small current element at position (0, y, 0) with length dy. The position vector r from this current element to the point (3 cm, 4 cm, 0 cm) is:\n\nr = (3, 4 - y, 0)\n\nThe differential length vector dl for the current element is:\n\ndl = (0, dy, 0)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (0, 0, -3dy)\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(3^2 + (4 - y)^2)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law equation:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 * (-3dy) / (3^2 + (4 - y)^2)^(3/2))\n\nSince we are only interested in the magnitude of the magnetic field, we can ignore the negative sign:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (6dy / (3^2 + (4 - y)^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression along the length of the wire (from y = 0 to y = 5 cm):\n\nB = ∫(dB) from 0 to 5\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(6dy / (3^2 + (4 - y)^2)^(3/2)) from 0 to 5\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) / 4π) * ∫(6dy / (3^2 + (4 - y)^2)^(3/2)) from 0 to 5\n\nB = 10^(-7) * ∫(6dy / (3^2 + (4 - y)^2)^(3/2)) from 0 to 5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's substitute:\n\nu = 4 - y\ndu = -dy\n\nWhen y = 0, u = 4\nWhen y = 5, u = -1\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB = 10^(-7) * ∫(-6du / (3^2 + u^2)^(3/2)) from 4 to -1\n\nB = 10^(-7) * 6 * ∫(du / (3^2 + u^2)^(3/2)) from -1 to 4\n\nNow, we can solve this integral:\n\nB = 10^(-7) * 6 * (0.05556 - (-0.01852))\n\nB = 10^(-7) * 6 * 0.07408\n\nB = 2.6648 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point (3 cm, 4 cm, 0 cm) is approximately 2.6648 × 10^(-8) T."
