    "message_1": "A laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm is shone through a single slit with a width of 0.1 mm. If the screen is placed 2 meters away from the slit, what is the distance between the first two minima on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first two minima on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minima, m is the order of the minima (m = 1 for the first minima, m = 2 for the second minima), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength is given in nanometers (nm), and the slit width is given in millimeters (mm). We'll convert both to meters (m):\n\nλ = 632.8 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 632.8 * 10^-9 m\na = 0.1 mm * (1 m / 10^3 mm) = 0.1 * 10^-3 m\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\nθ1 = (1 * 632.8 * 10^-9 m) / (0.1 * 10^-3 m) = 6.328 * 10^-6 rad\nθ2 = (2 * 632.8 * 10^-9 m) / (0.1 * 10^-3 m) = 12.656 * 10^-6 rad\n\nNext, we can find the linear positions of the first two minima on the screen using the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the linear position on the screen, L is the distance between the slit and the screen, and θ is the angular position of the minima.\n\ny1 = 2 m * tan(6.328 * 10^-6 rad) ≈ 2 m * (6.328 * 10^-6 rad) = 12.656 * 10^-6 m\ny2 = 2 m * tan(12.656 * 10^-6 rad) ≈ 2 m * (12.656 * 10^-6 rad) = 25.312 * 10^-6 m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first two minima by subtracting their linear positions:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = (25.312 * 10^-6 m) - (12.656 * 10^-6 m) = 12.656 * 10^-6 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first two minima on the screen is approximately 12.656 μm."
