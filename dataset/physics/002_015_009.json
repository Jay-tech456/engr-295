    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between a hot reservoir at 80 °C and a cold reservoir at -10°C. If the heat absorbed by the heat pump from the hot reservoir is 150 J and the work done by the heat pump is 50 J, what is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the cold reservoir (Q_c) to the work done by the heat pump (W).\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat transferred to the cold reservoir (Q_c). We know that the heat absorbed by the heat pump from the hot reservoir is 150 J (Q_h) and the work done by the heat pump is 50 J (W). According to the energy conservation principle, the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir is equal to the sum of the heat transferred to the cold reservoir and the work done by the heat pump.\n\nQ_h = Q_c + W\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_c:\n\nQ_c = Q_h - W\nQ_c = 150 J - 50 J\nQ_c = 100 J\n\nNow that we have the value of Q_c, we can calculate the COP:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\nCOP = 100 J / 50 J\nCOP = 2\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 2."
