    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nThe effect of dark matter on the gravitational pull of a black hole can be understood through the concept of mass. Both dark matter and black holes have mass, and according to the general theory of relativity, mass warps the spacetime around it, creating a gravitational pull. When dark matter is present near a black hole, it adds to the overall mass of the system, increasing the gravitational pull of the black hole. This means that the black hole can attract more matter, including dark matter, towards it, causing it to grow in mass.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. Observations of galaxy rotation curves have shown that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than can be accounted for by the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\nMoreover, dark matter is believed to act as a cosmic scaffolding, providing the necessary gravitational force for the formation and growth of galaxies. In the early universe, dark matter would have clumped together due to gravity, creating regions of higher density. These dense regions would then attract normal, visible matter, leading to the formation of galaxies.\n\nIn summary, dark matter affects the gravitational pull of a black hole by adding to its overall mass, which in turn increases its gravitational pull. Dark matter also plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies by providing the necessary gravitational force for their formation and growth, as well as influencing their rotation curves."
