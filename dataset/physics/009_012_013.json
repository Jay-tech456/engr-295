    "message_2": "To find the image distance and height of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\nu = -25 cm (object distance is taken as negative)\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n1/15 = 1/(-25) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying all terms by -375v, we get:\n-25v = -15v + 375\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n10v = 375\nv = 37.5 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 37.5 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the height of the image (h') using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = h'/h = v/u\n\nwhere h is the object height and h' is the image height.\n\nGiven:\nh = 6 cm\n\nWe can now solve for h':\nm = v/u = 37.5/(-25) = -1.5\n\nh' = m * h = -1.5 * 6 = -9 cm\n\nThe height of the image (h') is -9 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nSo, the image distance is 37.5 cm, and the height of the image is 9 cm (inverted)."
