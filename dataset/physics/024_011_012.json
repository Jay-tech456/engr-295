    "message_2": "The chaotic behavior of the solar system can significantly affect the prediction of planetary positions over a long period of time. In a chaotic system, small perturbations or changes in initial conditions can lead to large differences in the system's behavior over time. This is often referred to as the \"butterfly effect.\"\n\nIn the solar system, the gravitational interactions between planets, moons, and other celestial bodies can cause small perturbations in their orbits. Over long periods of time, these small perturbations can accumulate and lead to significant changes in the positions and orbits of the planets.\n\nAs a result, predicting the exact positions of planets in the solar system becomes increasingly difficult as the time scale increases. For short periods of time, such as a few years or decades, the predictions can be quite accurate. However, as the time scale extends to centuries or millennia, the uncertainties in the predictions grow substantially due to the chaotic nature of the system.\n\nThis chaotic behavior also means that long-term predictions of planetary positions are sensitive to the accuracy of the initial conditions used in the calculations. Small errors in the initial positions or velocities of the planets can lead to large errors in the predicted positions over long periods of time.\n\nIn summary, the chaotic behavior of the solar system makes it challenging to accurately predict the positions of planets over long periods of time. While short-term predictions can be quite accurate, the uncertainties grow substantially as the time scale increases, making precise long-term predictions difficult."
