    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, the energy required to excite mercury atoms from their ground state to their first excited state can be determined by measuring the voltage at which inelastic collisions between electrons and mercury atoms occur. This voltage is known as the \"retarding voltage\" or \"stopping voltage.\"\n\nThe energy required to excite the mercury atoms can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = e * V\n\nwhere E is the energy required, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), and V is the retarding voltage.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the accelerating voltage (12 V) and the distance between the cathode and the anode (4 cm). However, we need the retarding voltage to calculate the energy required to excite the mercury atoms.\n\nThe retarding voltage can be determined experimentally by observing the voltage at which the current between the cathode and the anode drops significantly due to inelastic collisions between the electrons and the mercury atoms. For mercury, the first excited state is typically reached at a retarding voltage of approximately 4.9 V.\n\nNow that we have the retarding voltage, we can calculate the energy required to excite the mercury atoms:\n\nE = e * V\nE = (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (4.9 V)\nE â‰ˆ 7.84 x 10^-19 J\n\nTherefore, the energy required to excite mercury atoms from their ground state to their first excited state in the Franck-Hertz experiment is approximately 7.84 x 10^-19 J."
