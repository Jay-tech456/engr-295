    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation required to observe proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in a magnetic field with a strength of 2 Tesla, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nν = γ * B / (2 * π)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for the proton, B is the magnetic field strength, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFor a proton, the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is approximately 42.577 MHz/T (megahertz per tesla).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Larmor equation:\n\nν = (42.577 MHz/T) * (2 T) / (2 * π)\n\nν ≈ 85.154 MHz / (2 * π)\n\nν ≈ 13.56 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation required to observe proton NMR in a magnetic field with a strength of 2 Tesla is approximately 13.56 MHz."
