    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed, we first need to determine the image distance using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 40 cm\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/40 + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 40v:\n\n2v = v + 40\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = 40 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -40/40\n\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is -1, which means the image is the same size as the object but inverted."
