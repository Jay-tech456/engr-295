    "message_1": "A physics student is trying to investigate the polarization state of a beam of light. The student has a polarizer and would like to know the angle of the polarizer that will pass the maximum light intensity. If the initial intensity of the light beam is known, what is the angle of the polarizer that will pass maximum light intensity?",
    "message_2": "To pass the maximum light intensity through the polarizer, the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the plane of polarization of the light beam should be aligned. In this case, the angle should be 0 degrees. \n\nWhen the polarizer's transmission axis is aligned with the plane of polarization of the light beam, the maximum intensity of the light will pass through the polarizer. If the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the plane of polarization increases, the intensity of the transmitted light will decrease according to Malus's law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_initial * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the transmitted light intensity, I_initial is the initial light intensity, and theta is the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the plane of polarization of the light beam.\n\nSo, to pass the maximum light intensity, the angle (theta) should be 0 degrees."
