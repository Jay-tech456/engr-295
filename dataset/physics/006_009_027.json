    "message_1": "A physics student wants to calculate the change in wavelength and energy of a photon after undergoing the Compton effect in a helium atom. If the initial photon energy is 500 eV and the scattered photon is emitted at a 60-degree angle from its original direction, what are the final wavelength and energy of the photon?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula, which relates the initial and final wavelengths of a photon to the scattering angle:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ and λ' are the initial and final wavelengths, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial wavelength (λ) using the initial energy (E) of the photon:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nRearranging for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (500 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nλ ≈ 4.968 x 10^-10 m\n\nNow, we can find the change in wavelength (Δλ) using the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / ((9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 - cos(60°))\nΔλ ≈ 4.861 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can find the final wavelength (λ'):\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ\nλ' ≈ 4.968 x 10^-10 m + 4.861 x 10^-12 m\nλ' ≈ 5.017 x 10^-10 m\n\nNext, we need to find the final energy (E') of the photon using the final wavelength:\n\nE' = h * c / λ'\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nE' = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5.017 x 10^-10 m)\nE' ≈ 396.6 eV\n\nSo, the final wavelength of the photon is approximately 5.017 x 10^-10 m, and the final energy is approximately 396.6 eV."
