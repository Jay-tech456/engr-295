    "message_2": "In quantum field theory (QFT), the thermodynamics of black holes can be studied using the framework of Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect. The key idea is that black holes have a temperature and emit radiation, which is known as Hawking radiation. This radiation is a quantum effect that arises due to the interaction of the black hole's event horizon with the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields.\n\n1. Entropy:\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:\n\nS = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, A is the area of the black hole's event horizon, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThis formula shows that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon, which is a result of the holographic principle in quantum gravity.\n\n2. Temperature:\n\nThe temperature of a black hole is given by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (hbar * c^3) / (8 * pi * G * M * k)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, M is the mass of the black hole, and the other constants are the same as in the entropy formula.\n\nThis formula shows that the temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. As a black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation, its temperature increases.\n\n3. Other thermodynamic properties:\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of a black hole can be derived from its entropy and temperature. For example, the internal energy (U) can be obtained using the first law of thermodynamics:\n\ndU = TdS\n\nThe heat capacity (C) can be calculated using the relation:\n\nC = dU / dT\n\nAdditionally, the free energy (F) can be obtained using the relation:\n\nF = U - TS\n\nThese thermodynamic properties can be used to study the stability and phase transitions of black holes in quantum field theory.\n\nIn conclusion, the principles of quantum field theory can be applied to calculate the thermodynamics of black holes using the framework of Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect. The key mathematical expressions for the entropy and temperature of a black hole are the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula and the Hawking temperature formula, respectively. Other thermodynamic properties can be derived from these expressions using standard thermodynamic relations."
