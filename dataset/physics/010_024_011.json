    "message_2": "The smallest mass a gas cloud can have and still form a star through gravitational collapse is determined by the Jeans mass. The Jeans mass is a critical mass above which a gas cloud can collapse under its own gravity to form a star. Below this mass, the gas cloud is stable and will not collapse.\n\nThe Jeans mass (M_J) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nM_J = (5 * k * T * R_J) / (G * μ * m_H)\n\nwhere:\n- k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K)\n- T is the temperature of the gas cloud (in Kelvin)\n- R_J is the Jeans radius, which is the radius of the gas cloud when it becomes unstable and starts to collapse\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2)\n- μ is the mean molecular weight of the gas cloud, which depends on its composition\n- m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 × 10^(-27) kg)\n\nThe Jeans mass depends on the temperature, pressure, and density of the gas cloud. In general, a higher temperature or lower density will result in a larger Jeans mass, meaning that a more massive gas cloud is required to form a star. Conversely, a lower temperature or higher density will result in a smaller Jeans mass, allowing a less massive gas cloud to collapse and form a star.\n\nTo determine how the minimum mass varies with the properties of the gas cloud, we can consider the following relationships:\n\n1. Temperature: As the temperature increases, the Jeans mass increases. This is because higher temperatures lead to increased thermal pressure, which counteracts the gravitational force trying to collapse the gas cloud. A more massive gas cloud is needed to overcome this thermal pressure and collapse to form a star.\n\n2. Pressure: As the pressure increases, the Jeans mass decreases. Higher pressure generally corresponds to higher density, which means that the gas cloud is more likely to collapse under its own gravity. A smaller mass is needed for the gas cloud to become unstable and form a star.\n\n3. Density: As the density increases, the Jeans mass decreases. A denser gas cloud has more mass concentrated in a smaller volume, which increases the gravitational force acting on the gas cloud. This makes it more likely for the gas cloud to collapse and form a star, even if its total mass is relatively small.\n\nIn summary, the smallest mass a gas cloud can have and still form a star through gravitational collapse depends on its temperature, pressure, and density. The Jeans mass is a critical threshold that determines whether a gas cloud will collapse to form a star or remain stable. Higher temperatures and lower densities result in larger Jeans masses, while lower temperatures and higher densities result in smaller Jeans masses."
