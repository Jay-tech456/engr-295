    "message_2": "Cooper pairs play a crucial role in superconductivity, a phenomenon in which certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled below a critical temperature. The concept of Cooper pairs was introduced by Leon Cooper in 1956 and is an essential part of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity, which was developed in 1957.\n\nCooper pairs are formed when two electrons in a superconductor, which would normally repel each other due to their like charges, are attracted to each other indirectly through interactions with the lattice of positively charged ions in the material. This attractive interaction is mediated by phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations. When an electron moves through the lattice, it causes a local distortion in the lattice, creating a region of higher positive charge density. This distortion attracts another electron, and the two electrons become correlated, forming a Cooper pair.\n\nThese Cooper pairs behave as a single quantum entity and are described by a single wave function. They form a highly ordered state, known as a condensate, which is characterized by a macroscopic quantum coherence. In this state, all Cooper pairs move in unison, and their motion is highly coordinated.\n\nThe formation of Cooper pairs and their coherent motion is the key to understanding why superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance. In a normal conductor, electrons moving through the lattice experience scattering due to impurities and lattice vibrations, which leads to energy dissipation and electrical resistance. However, in a superconductor, the Cooper pairs can move through the lattice without scattering, as they are protected by the energy gap between the superconducting state and the normal state.\n\nThis energy gap arises due to the formation of Cooper pairs and represents the energy required to break a Cooper pair. Since thermal energy at temperatures below the critical temperature is not sufficient to break the Cooper pairs, they can move through the lattice without scattering, and the material exhibits zero electrical resistance.\n\nIn summary, Cooper pairs are responsible for the superconducting state in which electrons form highly ordered, coherent pairs that can move through the lattice without scattering. This coherent motion of Cooper pairs allows superconductors to exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled below their critical temperature."
