    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of a tau lepton in the laboratory frame, we need to consider the time dilation effect due to its relativistic speed. The proper lifetime of a tau lepton (τ₀) is approximately 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the tau lepton traveling at a speed of 0.99c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\nwhere v is the speed of the tau lepton and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = 0.99c\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99c)²/c²)\nγ ≈ 7.0888\n\nNow, we can calculate the lifetime of the tau lepton in the laboratory frame (τ) using the time dilation formula:\n\nτ = γ * τ₀\n\nτ = 7.0888 * 2.9 x 10^(-13) s\nτ ≈ 2.0557 x 10^(-12) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of a tau lepton with energy 5 GeV, traveling at a speed of 0.99c in a laboratory frame, is approximately 2.0557 x 10^(-12) seconds."
