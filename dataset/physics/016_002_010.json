    "message_2": "The Meissner effect is a phenomenon observed in superconductors, where the magnetic field inside the superconducting material is expelled when the material transitions into the superconducting state. This effect can be described mathematically using the London equations, which were proposed by Fritz and Heinz London in 1935.\n\nThe London equations are:\n\n1. ∇ × J = - (1/λ^2) * B\n2. ∇ × B = μ₀ * J\n\nHere, J is the superconducting current density, B is the magnetic field, λ is the London penetration depth, and μ₀ is the vacuum permeability.\n\nThe first London equation states that the curl of the superconducting current density is proportional to the negative of the magnetic field. This means that the superconducting current flows in such a way that it cancels out the applied magnetic field inside the superconductor.\n\nThe second London equation is a form of Ampere's law, which relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current density. In the context of superconductors, it connects the magnetic field to the superconducting current density.\n\nTo understand how the Meissner effect relates to the expulsion of magnetic fields, we can combine the two London equations:\n\n∇ × (∇ × B) = μ₀ * (∇ × J) = -μ₀/λ^2 * B\n\nUsing the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × B) = ∇(∇ • B) - ∇²B and the fact that ∇ • B = 0 (from Gauss's law for magnetism), we get:\n\n-∇²B = -μ₀/λ^2 * B\n\nThis is a Helmholtz equation, which describes the spatial behavior of the magnetic field inside the superconductor. The solutions to this equation show that the magnetic field decays exponentially inside the superconductor with a characteristic length scale λ (the London penetration depth). This means that the magnetic field is expelled from the bulk of the superconductor, and only penetrates a small distance (λ) into the material, which is the essence of the Meissner effect."
