    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the supernova, c is the speed of light, and R is the distance from the supernova.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given mass and distance into SI units.\n\n1 solar mass (M☉) ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n1 kiloparsec (kpc) ≈ 3.086 x 10^19 m\n\nMass of the supernova (M) = 20 M☉ = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\nDistance (R) = 10 kpc = 10 * 3.086 x 10^19 m = 3.086 x 10^20 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (3.978 x 10^31 kg)^2 * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.086 x 10^20 m)\n\nE ≈ (6.674 x 10^-11 * 1.582 x 10^63 * 3 x 10^8) / (3.086 x 10^20)\n\nE ≈ (3.16 x 10^52) / (3.086 x 10^20)\n\nE ≈ 1.02 x 10^32 Joules\n\nTherefore, the estimated energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a mass of 20 solar masses, a distance of 10 kiloparsecs, and a duration of 1 second is approximately 1.02 x 10^32 Joules."
