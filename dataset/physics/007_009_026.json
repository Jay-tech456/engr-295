    "message_1": "A nuclear physics student needs to calculate the amount of enriched Uranium-235 that needs to be added to natural Uranium in a centrifuge to produce fuel for a nuclear reactor with 3% U-235 enrichment, given that the natural Uranium contains 0.7% U-235 and the centrifuge is able to enrich Uranium-235 up to 5% concentration. How much enriched Uranium-235 must be added to the natural Uranium in the centrifuge?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the mass of natural Uranium as m_n and the mass of enriched Uranium-235 as m_e. The total mass of the mixture will be m_t = m_n + m_e. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Natural Uranium contains 0.7% U-235, so the mass of U-235 in natural Uranium is 0.007 * m_n.\n2. The enriched Uranium-235 has a concentration of 5%, so the mass of U-235 in enriched Uranium is 0.05 * m_e.\n3. The desired concentration of U-235 in the final mixture is 3%, so the mass of U-235 in the mixture is 0.03 * m_t.\n\nNow, we can write the mass balance equation for U-235 in the mixture:\n\n0.007 * m_n + 0.05 * m_e = 0.03 * (m_n + m_e)\n\nWe need to find the mass of enriched Uranium-235 (m_e) that needs to be added to the natural Uranium. To do this, we can rearrange the equation to solve for m_e in terms of m_n:\n\n0.05 * m_e - 0.03 * m_e = 0.03 * m_n - 0.007 * m_n\n0.02 * m_e = 0.023 * m_n\nm_e = 1.15 * m_n\n\nSo, for every unit mass of natural Uranium, 1.15 units of enriched Uranium-235 must be added to achieve the desired 3% U-235 enrichment in the mixture."
