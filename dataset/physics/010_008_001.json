    "message_1": "A solid sphere of radius 5 cm has a density of 2 g/cm³. If the sphere is completely submerged in a container of water, what is the buoyant force acting on the sphere?",
    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the sphere, we first need to find the volume of the sphere and then the mass of the water displaced by the sphere. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the sphere:\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nV = (4/3)π(5 cm)³\nV ≈ 523.6 cm³\n\n2. Calculate the mass of the water displaced by the sphere:\nSince the sphere is completely submerged in water, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the sphere. The density of water is 1 g/cm³.\n\nMass of water displaced = volume of water displaced × density of water\nMass of water displaced = 523.6 cm³ × 1 g/cm³\nMass of water displaced ≈ 523.6 g\n\n3. Calculate the buoyant force:\nThe buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere. The weight of an object is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity (g ≈ 9.81 m/s² or 981 cm/s²).\n\nBuoyant force = mass of water displaced × g\nBuoyant force = 523.6 g × 981 cm/s²\n\nNote that we need to convert grams to kilograms (1 g = 0.001 kg) and centimeters to meters (1 cm = 0.01 m) to use the standard units for force (Newtons).\n\nBuoyant force = (523.6 g × 0.001 kg/g) × (981 cm/s² × 0.01 m/cm)\nBuoyant force ≈ 5.236 kg × 9.81 m/s²\nBuoyant force ≈ 51.36 N\n\nThe buoyant force acting on the sphere is approximately 51.36 Newtons."
