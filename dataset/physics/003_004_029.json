    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.2 m\n\nFirst, let's calculate (R² + x²)^(3/2):\n\nR² + x² = (0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)² = 0.01 m² + 0.04 m² = 0.05 m²\n\nNow, raise this value to the power of 3/2:\n\n(0.05 m²)^(3/2) = 0.01118 m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * 0.01118 m³)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / 0.01118 m³\nB = 2.24 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point is approximately 2.24 × 10^(-6) T (tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it follows the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (counterclockwise when looking from above), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing upwards along the axis of the loop."
