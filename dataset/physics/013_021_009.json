This plasma is composed of charged particles that interact with magnetic fields, affecting the motion and distribution of matter within the ISM. The mathematical evidence supporting the role of magnetic fields in the formation of stars and planets can be derived from the equations governing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which describe the behavior of plasma in the presence of magnetic fields.\n\n1. The MHD equations:\n\nThe MHD equations are a set of conservation laws that describe the behavior of plasma in the presence of magnetic fields. They consist of the continuity equation, the momentum equation, the induction equation, and the energy equation.\n\nContinuity equation (conservation of mass):\n∂ρ/∂t + ∇ · (ρv) = 0\n\nMomentum equation (conservation of momentum):\nρ(∂v/∂t + v · ∇v) = -∇P + (J × B) + F_ext\n\nInduction equation (conservation of magnetic flux):\n∂B/∂t = ∇ × (v × B - η∇ × B)\n\nEnergy equation (conservation of energy):\n∂e/∂t + ∇ · [(e + P)v] = -ρv · F_ext + Q\n\nHere, ρ is the mass density, v is the velocity, P is the pressure, B is the magnetic field, J is the current density, η is the magnetic diffusivity, e is the internal energy density, F_ext is the external force, and Q is the heating/cooling term.\n\n2. The role of magnetic fields in star formation:\n\nMagnetic fields play a crucial role in the process of star formation by providing support against gravitational collapse. The balance between the gravitational force and the magnetic pressure can be represented by the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio, which is given by:\n\nλ = (M/Φ) / (M/Φ)_crit\n\nHere, M is the mass of the cloud, Φ is the magnetic flux, and (M/Φ)_crit is the critical mass-to-flux ratio, which is approximately 1/2πG^(1/2), where G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWhen λ > 1, the cloud is magnetically supercritical, meaning that gravity dominates over magnetic pressure, and the cloud can collapse to form a star. When λ < 1, the cloud is magnetically subcritical, and the magnetic pressure prevents the cloud from collapsing.\n\n3. The role of magnetic fields in planet formation:\n\nMagnetic fields also play a role in the formation of planets by influencing the behavior of the protoplanetary disk around a young star. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key process that drives turbulence in the disk, which in turn leads to the transport of angular momentum and the accretion of material onto the central star. The MRI can be described mathematically by the dispersion relation:\n\nω^2 = k^2 v_A^2 - 2Ωk v_A cos(θ)\n\nHere, ω is the angular frequency of the instability, k is the wavenumber, v_A is the Alfvén speed, Ω is the angular velocity of the disk, and θ is the angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field.\n\nWhen the condition ω^2 < 0 is satisfied, the MRI is active, and the disk becomes turbulent, promoting the growth of planetesimals and eventually the formation of planets.\n\nIn conclusion, magnetic fields play a crucial role in the formation of stars and planets by influencing the behavior of plasma in the interstellar medium and protoplanetary disks. The mathematical evidence supporting this role can be found in the magnetohydrodynamic equations and the associated concepts of the mass-to-flux ratio and the magnetorotational instability."
