    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of a hydrogen atom due to its interaction with a magnetic field, we need to consider the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the electron and proton.\n\nThe hyperfine interaction energy can be expressed as:\n\nΔE = -μ · B\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two hyperfine levels, μ is the magnetic moment, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic moment of the electron (μe) and proton (μp) can be expressed as:\n\nμe = -g_e * μ_B * m_e\nμp = g_p * μ_N * m_p\n\nwhere g_e and g_p are the g-factors for the electron and proton, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, and m_e and m_p are the magnetic quantum numbers for the electron and proton.\n\nFor the ground state of the hydrogen atom, m_e = ±1/2 and m_p = ±1/2. The g-factors for the electron and proton are g_e ≈ 2 and g_p ≈ 5.585. The Bohr magneton (μ_B) is approximately 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T, and the nuclear magneton (μ_N) is approximately 5.051 × 10^(-27) J/T.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moments of the electron and proton:\n\nμe = -2 * (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (1/2) = -9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\nμp = 5.585 * (5.051 × 10^(-27) J/T) * (1/2) = 1.407 × 10^(-26) J/T\n\nThe total magnetic moment (μ) is the sum of the electron and proton magnetic moments:\n\nμ = μe + μp = -9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T + 1.407 × 10^(-26) J/T ≈ -9.273 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, we can calculate the hyperfine splitting energy due to the interaction with a magnetic field of 2 Tesla:\n\nΔE = -μ · B = (-9.273 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (2 T) = -1.855 × 10^(-23) J\n\nSo, the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of the hydrogen atom due to its interaction with a magnetic field of 2 Tesla is approximately -1.855 × 10^(-23) Joules."
