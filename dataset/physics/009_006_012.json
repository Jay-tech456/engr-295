    "message_2": "To determine the focal length of the concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the object distance (do) is 10 cm and the image distance (di) is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/f = 1/10 + 1/20\n\nTo solve for f, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/f = 2/20 + 1/20\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\n1/f = 3/20\n\nTo find the focal length (f), we take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation:\n\nf = 20/3\n\nSo, the focal length of the concave mirror is approximately 6.67 cm."
