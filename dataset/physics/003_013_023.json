    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis. In this case, we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, so x = 0.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0.1 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * 0.01 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * 0.01 m²)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / 0.02 m²\n\nB ≈ 1.885 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.885 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
