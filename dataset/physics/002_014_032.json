If the refrigerator consumes 200 J of energy, what is the maximum amount of heat that can be extracted from the 5°C reservoir? Calculate the coefficient of performance and the efficiency of the refrigerator.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the Carnot cycle, which is the most efficient cycle possible for a heat engine or refrigerator operating between two thermal reservoirs.\n\nFirst, let's convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT1 = 5°C + 273.15 = 278.15 K (temperature of the cold reservoir)\nT2 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K (temperature of the hot reservoir)\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nCOP = T1 / (T2 - T1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nCOP = 278.15 K / (298.15 K - 278.15 K) = 278.15 / 20 = 13.9075\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum amount of heat that can be extracted from the 5°C reservoir (Q1) using the formula:\n\nQ1 = COP * W\n\nWhere W is the work done (energy consumed) by the refrigerator.\n\nQ1 = 13.9075 * 200 J = 2781.5 J\n\nSo, the maximum amount of heat that can be extracted from the 5°C reservoir is 2781.5 J.\n\nTo calculate the efficiency of the refrigerator, we can use the formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Q2 - Q1) / Q2\n\nWhere Q2 is the heat released to the hot reservoir. We can find Q2 using the energy conservation principle:\n\nQ2 = Q1 + W\n\nQ2 = 2781.5 J + 200 J = 2981.5 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = (2981.5 J - 2781.5 J) / 2981.5 J = 200 J / 2981.5 J = 0.0671\n\nThe efficiency of the refrigerator is 0.0671 or 6.71%."
