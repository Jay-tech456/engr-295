    "message_2": "To find the angle of the Polaroid with respect to the initial direction of polarization of the light, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a Polaroid is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis of the Polaroid and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nMathematically, Malus' Law is given by:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the transmitted intensity, I_incident is the incident intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the Polaroid and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nFor unpolarized light, the average value of cos²(θ) is 1/2. Therefore, the intensity of light after passing through the first Polaroid is:\n\nI_polarized = I_incident * 1/2 = 10 W/m² * 1/2 = 5 W/m²\n\nNow, we have the polarized light with an intensity of 5 W/m² incident on the second Polaroid. The transmitted intensity through the second Polaroid is given as 2 W/m². Using Malus' Law again:\n\n2 W/m² = 5 W/m² * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 W/m²:\n\ncos²(θ) = 2/5\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\ncos(θ) = sqrt(2/5)\n\nFinally, find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine:\n\nθ = arccos(sqrt(2/5))\n\nθ ≈ 52.4°\n\nSo, the angle of the Polaroid with respect to the initial direction of polarization of the light is approximately 52.4°."
