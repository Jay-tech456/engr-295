    "message_2": "To calculate the time it takes for a protostar to reach the main sequence stage, we can use the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale (t_KH), which is an approximation of the time it takes for a star to contract and reach a stable state. The Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale is given by the formula:\n\nt_KH = (G * M^2) / (R * L)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the protostar, R is its radius, and L is its luminosity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the luminosity (L) of the protostar. We can use the formula for the Eddington Luminosity, which is given by:\n\nL = (4 * π * c * G * M * m_p) / σ_T\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, m_p is the mass of a proton, and σ_T is the Thomson scattering cross-section.\n\nThe values of the constants are:\nG = 6.674 × 10^-8 cm^3 g^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 × 10^10 cm/s\nm_p = 1.673 × 10^-24 g\nσ_T = 6.652 × 10^-25 cm^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the Eddington Luminosity:\n\nL = (4 * π * (2.998 × 10^10 cm/s) * (6.674 × 10^-8 cm^3 g^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^33 g) * (1.673 × 10^-24 g)) / (6.652 × 10^-25 cm^2)\nL ≈ 3.8 × 10^38 erg/s\n\nNow that we have the luminosity, we can calculate the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale:\n\nt_KH = ((6.674 × 10^-8 cm^3 g^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^33 g)^2) / ((10^11 cm) * (3.8 × 10^38 erg/s))\nt_KH ≈ 4.4 × 10^11 s\n\nTo convert this to years, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 year = 3.154 × 10^7 s\n\nt_KH ≈ (4.4 × 10^11 s) / (3.154 × 10^7 s/year)\nt_KH ≈ 1.4 × 10^4 years\n\nSo, it takes approximately 14,000 years for a protostar of mass 1 solar mass and radius 10^9 km to reach the main sequence stage of its evolutionary cycle, assuming it starts contracting from a density of 10^-16 g/cm^3 and a temperature of 10,000 K."
