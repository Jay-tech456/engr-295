    "message_2": "The Feynman diagram for the electron-positron annihilation process into a muon-antimuon pair in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) consists of two vertices connected by a virtual photon. The incoming particles are an electron (e-) and a positron (e+), and the outgoing particles are a muon (μ-) and an antimuon (μ+). The diagram can be represented as follows:\n\n```\ne-  →  e-  →  μ-\n       |\ne+  →  e+  →  μ+\n```\n\nHere, the horizontal lines represent the propagation of the particles, and the vertical line represents the exchange of a virtual photon (γ) between the electron and positron, which annihilate each other, and the muon and antimuon, which are created.\n\nTo calculate the corresponding Feynman amplitude for this process, we need to consider the QED interaction Lagrangian, which is given by:\n\nL_int = -e * (ψ_e_bar * γ^μ * ψ_e) * A_μ\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, ψ_e_bar and ψ_e are the electron and positron wave functions, γ^μ is the gamma matrix, and A_μ is the photon field.\n\nThe Feynman amplitude for this process can be written as:\n\nM = -e^2 * (u_μ_bar * γ^μ * u_e) * (v_μ * γ_μ * v_e_bar)\n\nwhere u_e, u_μ, v_e, and v_μ are the wave functions for the electron, muon, positron, and antimuon, respectively.\n\nThe physical meaning of the Feynman amplitude is that it represents the probability amplitude for the given process to occur. The square of the amplitude's absolute value, |M|^2, is proportional to the probability of the process occurring. In this case, it represents the probability of an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing a muon and an antimuon via the exchange of a virtual photon."
