    "message_2": "To find the energy of a relativistic particle, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the relativistic momentum. The rest mass is given as 0.5 MeV/c². The velocity is given as 0.8c.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relativistic momentum (p). We can use the formula:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass and v is the velocity. Plugging in the given values:\n\np = (0.5 MeV/c²) * (0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\n\np = (0.5 MeV/c²) * (0.8c) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\np = (0.5 MeV/c²) * (0.8c) / sqrt(0.36)\n\np = (0.5 MeV/c²) * (0.8c) / (0.6c)\n\np = (0.5 * 0.8 / 0.6) MeV/c\n\np = (0.4) MeV/c\n\nNow that we have the relativistic momentum, we can find the total energy using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nE² = ((0.5 MeV/c²)c²)² + ((0.4 MeV/c)c)²\n\nE² = (0.5 MeV)² + (0.4 MeV)²\n\nE² = 0.25 MeV² + 0.16 MeV²\n\nE² = 0.41 MeV²\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nE = sqrt(0.41 MeV²)\n\nE ≈ 0.64 MeV\n\nSo, the energy of the relativistic particle is approximately 0.64 MeV."
