    "message_1": "A heat pump has a coefficient of performance of 3.5 when it operates between two reservoirs at temperatures of 20°C and 5°C. What is the amount of heat energy it can extract from the colder reservoir for every 1000 Joules of work input to the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat energy extracted from the colder reservoir (Q_c) to the work input (W) required to operate the heat pump. Mathematically, it is given by:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nGiven that the COP of the heat pump is 3.5 and the work input is 1000 Joules, we can find the amount of heat energy extracted from the colder reservoir (Q_c) using the formula:\n\nQ_c = COP * W\n\nQ_c = 3.5 * 1000\n\nQ_c = 3500 Joules\n\nSo, the heat pump can extract 3500 Joules of heat energy from the colder reservoir for every 1000 Joules of work input."
