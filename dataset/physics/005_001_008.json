    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a speed of 0.8c relative to the Earth. If the clock on the spaceship reads 60 minutes, how much time has passed on Earth? (Assume time dilation due to relativity)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time interval measured by an observer at rest relative to the moving object (in this case, on Earth)\nΔt0 is the time interval measured by an observer moving with the object (in this case, on the spaceship)\nv is the relative velocity between the two observers (0.8c)\nc is the speed of light\n\nGiven that the clock on the spaceship reads 60 minutes (Δt0 = 60 minutes), we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔt = 60 minutes / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt = 60 minutes / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt = 60 minutes / sqrt(0.36)\n\nΔt = 60 minutes / 0.6\n\nΔt ≈ 100 minutes\n\nSo, about 100 minutes have passed on Earth while 60 minutes have passed on the spaceship."
