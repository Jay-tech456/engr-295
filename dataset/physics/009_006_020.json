    "message_1": "A student is given a concave mirror with a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 30 cm away from the mirror. What is the mirror's magnification and where is the image located?",
    "message_2": "To find the image location, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/di\n\n50 / 600 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\n\ndi = 600 / 50\ndi = 12 cm\n\nThe image is located 12 cm away from the mirror.\n\nTo find the magnification, we can use the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -12/30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe mirror's magnification is -0.4, which means the image is inverted and reduced in size compared to the object."
