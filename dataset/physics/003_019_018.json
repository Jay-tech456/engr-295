    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor of radius 2 mm and an outer conductor of radius 4 mm. The inner conductor carries a current of 3 A in the positive z-direction. Calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 mm from the center of the coaxial cable.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 mm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it can be written as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is symmetrical and circles around the inner conductor. At a radial distance of 3 mm, we are inside the outer conductor but outside the inner conductor. Therefore, we can consider a circular loop of radius 3 mm around the inner conductor.\n\nSince the magnetic field is symmetrical, B is constant along the circular loop. Thus, the line integral of B can be simplified as:\n\nB * ∮ dl = B * (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circular loop (3 mm).\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the loop is outside the inner conductor, the enclosed current is the current in the inner conductor, which is 3 A.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we can write:\n\nB * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nB * (2 * π * 0.003 m) = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 3 A\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.003 m)\n\nB ≈ 2 * 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a radial distance of 3 mm from the center of the coaxial cable is approximately 2 * 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
