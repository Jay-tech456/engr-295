    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor of radius 1 mm and an outer conductor of radius 5 mm. A current of 2 A flows in the inner conductor in the direction of z-axis. Determine the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2 mm from the axis of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2 mm from the axis of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is symmetrical and in the azimuthal direction (θ). Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop of radius r (2 mm in this case) in the xy-plane. The line integral of the magnetic field around this loop is:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = B * 2πr\n\nThe enclosed current (I_enclosed) is the current flowing through the inner conductor, which is 2 A.\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nWhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (permeability of free space)\nI_enclosed = 2 A (current enclosed by the loop)\nr = 2 mm = 0.002 m (radial distance from the axis)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.002 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (2π * 0.002 m)\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 0.002 m\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2 mm from the axis of the cable is 2 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
