    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 5000 lines per centimeter. If the grating is used to diffract light with a wavelength of 500 nm, what is the angle between the first order maximum and the central maximum in the resulting diffraction pattern?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the first order maximum and the central maximum, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle between the maximum and the central maximum, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 5000 lines per centimeter, we can find the distance between the lines as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 5000 lines/cm = 1/5000 cm/line = 0.0002 cm/line\n\nNow, we need to convert this distance to meters:\n\nd = 0.0002 cm/line * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.000002 m/line\n\nNext, we need to convert the wavelength of the light from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm * (1 m / 1,000,000,000 nm) = 5 * 10^(-7) m\n\nNow, we can use the diffraction grating equation to find the angle θ for the first order maximum (m = 1):\n\n0.000002 m/line * sin(θ) = 1 * 5 * 10^(-7) m\n\nsin(θ) = (5 * 10^(-7) m) / (0.000002 m/line)\n\nsin(θ) = 0.25\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine of 0.25:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.25) ≈ 14.48 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the first order maximum and the central maximum in the resulting diffraction pattern is approximately 14.48 degrees."
