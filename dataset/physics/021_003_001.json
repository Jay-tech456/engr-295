    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift of light emitted from a star orbiting a supermassive black hole, we need to know the mass of the black hole, the distance between the star and the black hole, and the speed of light. The gravitational redshift, also known as the gravitational shift, is the change in the frequency and wavelength of light due to the gravitational field of a massive object.\n\nLet's denote the mass of the black hole as M, the distance between the star and the black hole as r, and the speed of light as c. The gravitational constant is denoted by G.\n\nThe formula for gravitational redshift is given by:\n\nz = (1 - 2GM/(rc^2))^(-1/2) - 1\n\nHere, z is the redshift factor, which tells us how much the frequency and wavelength of light are shifted due to the gravitational field.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need the values of M, r, and c. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. The gravitational constant, G, is approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. The mass of the black hole and the distance between the star and the black hole would need to be provided or estimated based on the specific scenario.\n\nOnce we have the values for M and r, we can plug them into the formula and calculate the gravitational redshift, z. The higher the value of z, the more the light is redshifted, meaning the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer."
