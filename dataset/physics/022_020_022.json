    "message_2": "As a physicist, I can provide you with some insights into the possibility of dark matter being composed of supersymmetric particles, but I cannot give you an exact probability. The reason is that the probability depends on the development of theoretical models and the results of ongoing and future experiments.\n\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles, or sparticles, which are partners to the known particles. Some of these sparticles, such as the neutralino, are considered as potential dark matter candidates.\n\nExperimental constraints on the mass and interaction strengths of supersymmetric particles come from particle collider experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and astrophysical observations like those from the Planck satellite. So far, these experiments have not found any direct evidence for supersymmetric particles, which has led to increasingly stringent constraints on their properties.\n\nDespite the lack of direct evidence, supersymmetry remains an attractive candidate for dark matter because it can naturally explain the observed relic density of dark matter in the universe. However, the absence of experimental confirmation has led some physicists to explore alternative dark matter candidates, such as axions or other weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to assign a specific probability to the hypothesis that dark matter is composed of supersymmetric particles. The likelihood of this scenario depends on the development of theoretical models, the results of ongoing and future experiments, and the discovery of new phenomena that could provide further evidence for or against supersymmetry."
