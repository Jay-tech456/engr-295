    "message_2": "In the non-relativistic limit, we can use the Feynman diagram for the scattering of two electrons via the exchange of a virtual photon. The scattering amplitude, often denoted as M, can be calculated using the Feynman rules for quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n\nThe scattering amplitude for this process is given by:\n\nM = (-ie)^2 u_1(p')γ^μu_1(p) D_μν(q) u_2(k')γ^νu_2(k)\n\nwhere:\n- e is the elementary charge\n- u_1(p) and u_2(k) are the initial electron wave functions with momenta p and k, respectively\n- u_1(p') and u_2(k') are the final electron wave functions with momenta p' and k', respectively\n- γ^μ and γ^ν are the Dirac gamma matrices\n- D_μν(q) is the photon propagator with momentum q\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit, we can approximate the electron wave functions using the Pauli spinors and the photon propagator using the Coulomb propagator. The scattering amplitude becomes:\n\nM ≈ (-ie)^2 (2m_e)² (1/q²) (1 - v/c)²\n\nwhere:\n- m_e is the electron mass\n- q = p - p' = k' - k is the momentum transfer\n- v is the relative velocity of the electrons\n- c is the speed of light\n\nNow, we can relate the scattering amplitude to the differential cross-section using the following formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = |M|^2 / (64π²ħ²v²)\n\nwhere:\n- dσ/dΩ is the differential cross-section\n- ħ is the reduced Planck constant\n\nBy plugging the scattering amplitude into this formula, we can find the differential cross-section for the scattering of two electrons in the non-relativistic limit."
