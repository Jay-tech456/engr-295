    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed (1000 J), m is the mass of the substance (200 g), and ΔT is the change in temperature (50°C).\n\nWe need to rearrange the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 1000 J / (200 g × 50°C)\n\nc = 1000 J / 10000 g°C\n\nc = 0.1 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the copper block is 0.1 J/g°C."
