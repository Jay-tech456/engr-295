    "message_1": "A toroidal solenoid with 200 turns per meter carries a current of 4 amps. If the mean radius of the solenoid is 0.2 meter and the length of the solenoid is 1 meter, what is the magnetic field strength (in tesla) at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the solenoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the toroidal solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law. For a toroidal solenoid, the magnetic field strength (B) is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nn = number of turns per unit length (turns/meter)\nI = current (amps)\nr = distance from the center of the solenoid (meters)\n\nGiven values:\nn = 200 turns/meter\nI = 4 amps\nr = 0.05 meters (distance from the center of the solenoid)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 200 turns/m * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 800 A/m) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = (3.2 × 10^(-4) T) / 0.1\n\nB = 3.2 × 10^(-3) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a distance of 0.05 meters from the center of the toroidal solenoid is 3.2 × 10^(-3) Tesla."
