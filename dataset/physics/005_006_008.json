    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the gravitational redshift formula, which is derived from the general theory of relativity. The formula is:\n\nΔf/f = Δν/ν = -ΔΦ/c^2\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, Δν is the change in the frequency of light, ν is the initial frequency of light, ΔΦ is the change in gravitational potential, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the gravitational potential at the star's surface (Φ_star) as 1.5 x 10^7 J/kg, and we need to find the change in frequency (Δf) as observed by a telescope on Earth. To do this, we first need to find the change in gravitational potential (ΔΦ) between the star's surface and Earth.\n\nSince the Earth's gravitational potential (Φ_Earth) is much smaller than the star's gravitational potential, we can approximate the change in gravitational potential as:\n\nΔΦ = Φ_star - Φ_Earth ≈ Φ_star = 1.5 x 10^7 J/kg\n\nNow, we can use the gravitational redshift formula to find the change in frequency:\n\nΔf/f = -ΔΦ/c^2\n\nWe know the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔf/f = -(1.5 x 10^7 J/kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔf/f = -(1.5 x 10^7 J/kg) / (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nΔf/f ≈ -1.67 x 10^-10\n\nSince we are interested in the change in frequency (Δf), we can express it in terms of the initial frequency (f):\n\nΔf = -1.67 x 10^-10 * f\n\nThis equation tells us that the change in frequency is proportional to the initial frequency, with a proportionality constant of -1.67 x 10^-10. To find the actual change in frequency for a specific light wave, we would need to know the initial frequency (f) of that light wave."
