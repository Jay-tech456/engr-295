    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular current-carrying coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis. In this case, we are looking for the magnetic field at the center of the coil, so x = 0.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nI = 2 A\nN = 10 turns\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.05 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 * 0.0025 m²) / (0.0025 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 * 0.0025 m²) / (0.0025 m²)\n\nB = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10\n\nB = 8π × 10^(-7) T * 10\n\nB ≈ 2.51 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular current-carrying coil is approximately 2.51 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
