    "message_2": "String theory proposes to resolve the information paradox of black holes by suggesting that the information is not lost but rather encoded in the black hole's event horizon. This idea is based on the holographic principle, which states that the information contained within a volume of space can be represented by a lower-dimensional boundary, such as the event horizon of a black hole.\n\nIn string theory, fundamental particles are replaced by one-dimensional strings, and these strings can interact and combine in various ways. When matter falls into a black hole, the strings that make up the matter are absorbed by the black hole and become part of its event horizon. The information about the original matter is then encoded in the form of string configurations on the event horizon.\n\nAs the black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, the strings on the event horizon are gradually released back into the surrounding space. This process transfers the information from the black hole back into the universe, albeit in a highly scrambled form. In this way, string theory suggests that the information paradox can be resolved, as the information is not lost but rather transformed and eventually returned to the universe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this resolution is still a theoretical proposal, and further research is needed to fully understand the implications and test the predictions of string theory in the context of black holes and the information paradox."
