    "message_1": "In the study of the Mössbauer effect in atoms, a student observes a doublet of Fe57 gamma ray spectral lines. One line has an energy of 14.4 keV, while the other has an energy of 14.2 keV. The student is asked to explain the origin of this doublet and calculate the fraction of iron nuclei that is affected by the effect.",
    "message_2": "The Mössbauer effect is a phenomenon in which gamma rays emitted by certain atomic nuclei can be absorbed by other nuclei of the same type without any loss of energy due to the recoil of the emitting nucleus. This effect is observed in some isotopes, such as Fe57.\n\nThe doublet of Fe57 gamma ray spectral lines observed by the student is likely due to the hyperfine splitting of the energy levels in the nucleus. This splitting occurs because of the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the magnetic field produced by the electrons in the atom. The two energy levels correspond to the parallel and antiparallel alignment of the nuclear magnetic moment with the magnetic field.\n\nTo calculate the fraction of iron nuclei affected by the Mössbauer effect, we can use the following formula:\n\nFraction = (ΔE / E₀) * 100%\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two spectral lines, and E₀ is the energy of the higher-energy line.\n\nΔE = 14.4 keV - 14.2 keV = 0.2 keV\nE₀ = 14.4 keV\n\nFraction = (0.2 keV / 14.4 keV) * 100% = 1.39%\n\nSo, approximately 1.39% of the iron nuclei are affected by the Mössbauer effect."
