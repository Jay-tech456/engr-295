    "message_1": "What is the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in a superconducting coil with an inductance of 10 H and a current of 50 A before it loses its superconductivity? Also, calculate the energy that can be stored in the same coil when it becomes resistive.",
    "message_2": "The energy stored in an inductor can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (1/2) * L * I^2\n\nwhere E is the energy stored, L is the inductance, and I is the current.\n\nFor the superconducting coil with an inductance of 10 H and a current of 50 A:\n\nE = (1/2) * 10 H * (50 A)^2\nE = 5 * 2500\nE = 12,500 J (joules)\n\nSo, the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the superconducting coil before it loses its superconductivity is 12,500 joules.\n\nWhen the coil becomes resistive, the energy stored in the coil will be dissipated as heat due to the resistance. Therefore, the energy that can be stored in the coil when it becomes resistive is 0 joules, as all the energy will be lost as heat."
