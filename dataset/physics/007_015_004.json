    "message_2": "The nuclear force, also known as the strong nuclear force or the strong interaction, is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus. The range of nuclear forces is quite short, typically around 1 to 3 femtometers (1 fm = 10^-15 meters).\n\nThe nuclear force is a residual effect of the more fundamental strong force, which acts between quarks (the constituents of protons and neutrons). The nuclear force is attractive and very strong at short distances, but it quickly decreases as the distance between the nucleons (protons and neutrons) increases. This behavior can be roughly described by the Yukawa potential:\n\nV(r) = -g * (e^(-r/λ) / r)\n\nHere, V(r) is the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of their separation distance r, g is the strength of the interaction, and λ is the range parameter, which is related to the mass of the exchange particle (pion) responsible for mediating the force. The exponential term e^(-r/λ) represents the rapid decrease of the force with increasing distance.\n\nIn summary, the range of nuclear forces is about 1 to 3 femtometers, and they are very strong at short distances but decrease rapidly with increasing distance between the nuclear particles. This short-range behavior is responsible for the stability of atomic nuclei, as the nuclear force can overcome the electrostatic repulsion between protons within this range."
