    "message_2": "According to the current standard model of cosmology, which is based on the Lambda-CDM (Cold Dark Matter) model, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. This estimation takes into account the principles of special relativity, as well as general relativity, which are both integral to our understanding of the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation. The age of the universe is determined by measuring the Hubble constant, the rate of expansion of the universe, and other cosmological parameters."
