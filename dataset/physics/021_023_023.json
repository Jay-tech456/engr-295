    "message_2": "Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that may have been formed during the early universe. They are not directly related to black holes, and their existence is still a matter of debate among physicists. The likelihood of an observable cosmic string being created by a black hole with a mass of 100 solar masses and a rotation rate of 0.9 times the maximum possible spin is not well-defined, as the formation of cosmic strings is not associated with black holes.\n\nIf cosmic strings exist, they would have been formed during phase transitions in the early universe, not through the processes involving black holes. Therefore, the properties of a black hole, such as its mass and rotation rate, would not have a direct impact on the likelihood of a cosmic string's creation or observability."
