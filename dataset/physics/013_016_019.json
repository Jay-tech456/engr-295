    "message_2": "Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is believed to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is thought to be a property of the vacuum of space itself, and its effects can be described by a cosmological constant, denoted by Λ (Lambda).\n\nThe presence of dark energy can be explained mathematically through the Friedmann equations, which describe the expansion of the universe in the context of general relativity. The first Friedmann equation is given by:\n\n(1) H^2 = (8πG/3)ρ - k/a^2 + Λc^2/3\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, ρ is the energy density of the universe, k is the curvature parameter, a is the scale factor, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe second Friedmann equation is given by:\n\n(2) (dH/da) = -4πG(ρ + 3P/c^2)/a\n\nwhere P is the pressure.\n\nDark energy is characterized by a negative pressure, which means that it has a repulsive effect on the expansion of the universe. This can be seen in the second Friedmann equation: if P is negative, then the right-hand side of the equation becomes positive, leading to an accelerating expansion (dH/da > 0).\n\nTo calculate the percentage of the total energy present in the universe that is composed of dark energy, we need to consider the energy density parameters. The energy density parameter for dark energy is denoted by ΩΛ, and the total energy density parameter is Ω_total = Ω_matter + Ω_radiation + ΩΛ, where Ω_matter and Ω_radiation are the energy density parameters for matter and radiation, respectively.\n\nCurrent observations suggest that Ω_matter ≈ 0.3, Ω_radiation ≈ 10^(-4), and ΩΛ ≈ 0.7. Therefore, the percentage of the total energy present in the universe that is composed of dark energy can be calculated as:\n\nPercentage of dark energy = (ΩΛ / Ω_total) * 100\n= (0.7 / (0.3 + 10^(-4) + 0.7)) * 100\n≈ (0.7 / 1) * 100\n≈ 70%\n\nThus, dark energy is estimated to make up approximately 70% of the total energy present in the universe. This significant contribution of dark energy is responsible for the observed accelerating expansion of the universe."
