    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of chromatic aberration present in a glass prism, we need to find the difference in the deviation angles for red and blue light. Chromatic aberration occurs because the refractive index of a material depends on the wavelength of light passing through it. This phenomenon is known as dispersion.\n\nFirst, let's find the refractive indices for red and blue light using the Cauchy's dispersion formula:\n\nn(λ) = A + B/λ^2\n\nHere, n(λ) is the refractive index at wavelength λ, A and B are material-dependent constants. For a typical crown glass, we can use A = 1.50 and B = 0.01 µm² (values may vary depending on the specific type of glass).\n\nFor red light (λ = 700 nm = 0.7 µm):\nn_red = 1.50 + 0.01/(0.7^2) ≈ 1.50 + 0.0204 ≈ 1.5204\n\nFor blue light (λ = 400 nm = 0.4 µm):\nn_blue = 1.50 + 0.01/(0.4^2) ≈ 1.50 + 0.0625 ≈ 1.5625\n\nNow, let's find the angle of incidence (i) for both red and blue light using Snell's law:\n\nn_air * sin(i) = n * sin(r)\n\nHere, n_air = 1 (refractive index of air), i is the angle of incidence, n is the refractive index of the glass, and r is the angle of refraction.\n\nFor red light:\nsin(r_red) = (1/1.5204) * sin(30°) ≈ 0.3285\nr_red ≈ 19.47°\n\nFor blue light:\nsin(r_blue) = (1/1.5625) * sin(30°) ≈ 0.3199\nr_blue ≈ 18.93°\n\nNext, let's find the angle of deviation (D) for both red and blue light using the deviation formula:\n\nD = i + A - 2r\n\nHere, A is the apex angle of the prism (60°).\n\nFor red light:\nD_red = 30° + 60° - 2 * 19.47° ≈ 51.06°\n\nFor blue light:\nD_blue = 30° + 60° - 2 * 18.93° ≈ 52.14°\n\nFinally, let's find the chromatic aberration, which is the difference in deviation angles for red and blue light:\n\nChromatic aberration = |D_red - D_blue| ≈ |51.06° - 52.14°| ≈ 1.08°\n\nSo, the amount of chromatic aberration present in the glass prism is approximately 1.08°."
