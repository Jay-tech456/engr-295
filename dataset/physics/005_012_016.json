    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of a particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. In this case, v = 0.8c.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.6667 - 1)(1 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.6667(1 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 6 x 10^16 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 6 x 10^16 Joules."
