    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which relates the observed frequency (f_obs) to the source frequency (f_src) and the relative velocity between the source and the observer (v_rel). The formula is:\n\nf_obs = f_src * sqrt((1 + v_rel/c) / (1 - v_rel/c))\n\nIn this case, we are given f_src = 600 Hz, f_obs = 800 Hz, and the car's velocity (v_car) = 0.6c. We want to find the relative velocity between the car and the observer (v_rel).\n\nFirst, let's solve the Doppler effect formula for v_rel:\n\nf_obs / f_src = sqrt((1 + v_rel/c) / (1 - v_rel/c))\n(f_obs / f_src)^2 = (1 + v_rel/c) / (1 - v_rel/c)\n(1 - v_rel/c) * (f_obs / f_src)^2 = 1 + v_rel/c\n(1 - v_rel/c) * (800/600)^2 = 1 + v_rel/c\n(1 - v_rel/c) * (4/3)^2 = 1 + v_rel/c\n(1 - v_rel/c) * 16/9 = 1 + v_rel/c\n\nNow, let's solve for v_rel:\n\n16 - 16v_rel/c = 9 + 9v_rel/c\n16c - 16v_rel = 9c + 9v_rel\n7c = 25v_rel\nv_rel = 7c/25\n\nSo, the relative velocity between the car and the observer is:\n\nv_rel = 7c/25 â‰ˆ 0.28c"
