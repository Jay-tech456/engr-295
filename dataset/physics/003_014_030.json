    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of dimensions 10 cm x 20 cm is carrying a current of 2 A. What is the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl x r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nHowever, calculating the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop using the Biot-Savart Law directly can be quite complex. Instead, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field due to a straight wire and then use symmetry to find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop.\n\nThe magnetic field due to a straight wire carrying current I at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nFor the rectangular loop, we can divide it into four straight wires. Let's consider one of the shorter sides (10 cm) first. The distance from the center of the loop to the middle of the shorter side is 5 cm. The magnetic field due to this side at the center of the loop is:\n\nB_short = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m) = 8 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, let's consider one of the longer sides (20 cm). The distance from the center of the loop to the middle of the longer side is 10 cm. The magnetic field due to this side at the center of the loop is:\n\nB_long = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m) = 4 × 10^(-7) T\n\nDue to symmetry, the magnetic fields due to the opposite sides will have the same magnitudes but will be in opposite directions. Therefore, the net magnetic field at the center of the loop is the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to the shorter and longer sides:\n\nB_total = B_short + B_long = 8 × 10^(-7) T + 4 × 10^(-7) T = 12 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 1.2 × 10^(-6) T or 1.2 μT."
