    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a particle of mass m and energy E in terms of the wave function psi (ψ) and the speed of light c is given by the Klein-Gordon equation. The Klein-Gordon equation is a relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger equation and is written as:\n\n(∇² - (1/c²) ∂²/∂t²) ψ = (m²c²/ħ²) ψ\n\nHere, ∇² is the Laplacian operator, which represents the sum of second-order spatial derivatives, ∂²/∂t² is the second-order time derivative, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h-bar).\n\nThis equation is derived from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the particle. By substituting the quantum mechanical operators for energy (E = iħ∂/∂t) and momentum (p = -iħ∇), we obtain the Klein-Gordon equation."
