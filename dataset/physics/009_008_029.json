Draw a ray diagram to determine the location and size of the image formed. Is the image real or virtual? Is it magnified or diminished?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the focal length of the concave mirror. The radius of curvature (R) is given as 20 cm. The relationship between the radius of curvature and the focal length (f) is:\n\nf = R / 2\n\nSo, the focal length of the mirror is:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The mirror formula is:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere u is the object distance and v is the image distance. The object distance (u) is given as 10 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1/10 = 1/10 + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/10 = 0\n\nThis implies that the image is formed at infinity, which is not possible for a real image. Therefore, the image is virtual.\n\nSince the image is virtual, it is formed on the same side as the object. To determine the size of the image, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v / u\n\nSince v is infinite, the magnification is zero, which means the image is diminished.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is virtual, and it is diminished in size."
