Assume that 10% of the initial mass is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc².",
    "message_2": "To determine the energy released during the supernova explosion, we first need to find the mass that is converted into energy. Given that 10% of the initial mass is converted into energy, we can calculate the mass as follows:\n\nInitial mass of the star = 15 solar masses\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10^30 kg (mass of the Sun)\n\nMass converted into energy = 0.1 × 15 solar masses\nMass converted into energy = 0.1 × 15 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg\nMass converted into energy ≈ 2.984 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's equation E=mc² to calculate the energy released:\n\nE = mc²\nE = (2.984 × 10^30 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE ≈ 2.684 × 10^47 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released during the supernova explosion when a star with a mass of 15 solar masses collapses into a neutron star is approximately 2.684 × 10^47 Joules."
