    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 15 cm is used to reflect light from an object placed 30 cm away from it. What is the image distance?",
    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 15 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(2/30) = (1/30) + (1/di)\n\nNow, subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/di = 2/30 - 1/30\n\n1/di = 1/30\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is 30 cm."
