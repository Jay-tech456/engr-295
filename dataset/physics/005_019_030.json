    "message_2": "To find the phase difference between two waves that interfere constructively, we first need to determine the difference in their frequencies. The given frequencies are:\n\nf1 = 1.5 x 10^8 Hz\nf2 = 2 x 10^8 Hz\n\nThe difference in frequencies is:\n\nΔf = f2 - f1 = (2 x 10^8 Hz) - (1.5 x 10^8 Hz) = 0.5 x 10^8 Hz\n\nNow, we need to consider the Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the observers. The relative velocity between the observers is given as 0.6c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula for the frequency observed by an observer moving towards the source is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (c + v) / c\n\nFor the first frequency:\n\nf1_observed = f1 * (c + 0.6c) / c = f1 * 1.6\n\nFor the second frequency:\n\nf2_observed = f2 * (c + 0.6c) / c = f2 * 1.6\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in the observed frequencies:\n\nΔf_observed = f2_observed - f1_observed = (f2 * 1.6) - (f1 * 1.6) = 1.6 * Δf\n\nThe phase difference (Δφ) between the two waves can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (Δf_observed / f1_observed) * t\n\nSince the waves interfere constructively, the phase difference must be a multiple of 2π:\n\nΔφ = n * 2π, where n is an integer\n\nWe can rewrite the formula as:\n\nn * 2π = 2π * (1.6 * Δf / (f1 * 1.6)) * t\n\nThe 1.6 factors and 2π on both sides cancel out:\n\nn = (Δf / f1) * t\n\nSince we are looking for the phase difference, we can rearrange the formula to solve for n:\n\nn = (0.5 x 10^8 Hz) / (1.5 x 10^8 Hz) * t\n\nn = 1/3 * t\n\nThe phase difference will be a multiple of 2π, so the smallest phase difference that satisfies the condition for constructive interference is when n = 1:\n\nΔφ = 2π * (1/3) = 2π/3\n\nTherefore, the phase difference between the two waves is 2π/3 radians."
