    "message_1": "A physics student is studying relativistic particle trajectories and needs to find the velocity of an object that starts from rest and traveled a distance of 100 meters along a straight line in a reference frame moving with a velocity of 0.9c relative to an observer in the lab frame. If the object has a rest mass of 1 kg, what is its relativistic mass and how much energy was required to accelerate it to that speed?",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the object in the lab frame, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the reference frame (0.9c), v2 is the velocity of the object in the reference frame, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the object in the lab frame. Since the object starts from rest in the reference frame, v2 = 0, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nv = v1 = 0.9c\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass (m) using the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81) = 1 / sqrt(0.19) ≈ 2.294\n\nThe relativistic mass is given by:\n\nm = m0 * γ\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass (1 kg). So, the relativistic mass is:\n\nm ≈ 1 kg * 2.294 ≈ 2.294 kg\n\nFinally, we can find the energy required to accelerate the object to that speed using the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = (γ - 1) * m0 * c^2\n\nE ≈ (2.294 - 1) * 1 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 1.294 * 9 * 10^16 J ≈ 1.165 * 10^17 J\n\nSo, the energy required to accelerate the object to that speed is approximately 1.165 * 10^17 Joules."
