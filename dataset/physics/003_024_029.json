    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a single circular loop and then multiply it by the number of turns in the coil. The formula for the magnetic field B at the center of a single circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the loop, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nFor the given problem, we have:\n\nI = 2.0 A\nR = 0.10 m\nNumber of turns (n) = 50\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field due to a single loop:\n\nB_single = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.0 A) / (2 * 0.10 m)\nB_single = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.20 m\n\nNow, let's multiply the magnetic field due to a single loop by the number of turns in the coil:\n\nB_total = n * B_single\nB_total = 50 * (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.20 m\n\nB_total ≈ 3.14 * 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T."
