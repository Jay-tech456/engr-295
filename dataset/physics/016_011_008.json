    "message_2": "Cooper pairs form in superconducting materials due to an attractive interaction between electrons, which is mediated by lattice vibrations called phonons. This attractive interaction overcomes the natural repulsion between electrons due to their negative charge, allowing them to form bound pairs called Cooper pairs. The formation of Cooper pairs is the key to understanding superconductivity.\n\nIn a normal conductor, electrons move through the material and scatter off impurities, defects, and lattice vibrations, leading to electrical resistance. However, in a superconductor below its critical temperature, the formation of Cooper pairs changes the behavior of electrons dramatically.\n\nCooper pairs are formed from two electrons with opposite spins and momenta, which means they are in a singlet state. Due to their quantum mechanical nature, these pairs form a coherent, macroscopic quantum state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this state, the Cooper pairs move through the superconductor in a highly correlated manner, without scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations. This results in the phenomenon of superconductivity, where the electrical resistance of the material drops to zero.\n\nThe role of Cooper pairs in superconductivity can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. They allow electrons to overcome their natural repulsion and form bound pairs due to the attractive interaction mediated by phonons.\n2. The formation of Cooper pairs leads to the creation of a macroscopic quantum state (Bose-Einstein condensate) in which the pairs move coherently through the material.\n3. This coherent movement of Cooper pairs prevents scattering off impurities and lattice vibrations, leading to the absence of electrical resistance in the superconductor.\n\nThe understanding of Cooper pairs and their role in superconductivity was first described by Leon Cooper and subsequently developed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer in the BCS theory (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory), which earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972."
