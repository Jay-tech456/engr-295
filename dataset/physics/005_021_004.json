    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv' = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the observer relative to the mirror (0.9c), v2 is the velocity of the light beam relative to the mirror (c), and v' is the velocity of the light beam as observed by the observer.\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity of the light beam approaching the mirror as observed by the observer:\n\nv_approaching = (0.9c + c) / (1 + (0.9c * c) / c^2)\nv_approaching = (1.9c) / (1 + 0.9)\nv_approaching = 1.9c / 1.9\nv_approaching = c\n\nNow, let's find the velocity of the reflected light beam as observed by the observer:\n\nv_reflected = (0.9c - c) / (1 - (0.9c * c) / c^2)\nv_reflected = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.9)\nv_reflected = -0.1c / 0.1\nv_reflected = -c\n\nHowever, since the light beam is reflected, the direction is opposite, so the velocity of the reflected light beam as observed by the observer is:\n\nv_reflected = c\n\nSo, the velocity of the reflected light beam as observed by the observer is c, which is the speed of light."
