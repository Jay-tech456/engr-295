    "message_2": "To determine the minimum pressure required for a spherical bubble to collapse due to cavitation in water, we can use the following formula:\n\nP = 2 * σ / R\n\nwhere P is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bubble, σ is the surface tension of water, and R is the radius of the bubble.\n\nThe surface tension of water at room temperature is approximately 72 mN/m (millinewtons per meter).\n\nGiven the radius of the bubble, R = 0.3 mm = 0.0003 m, we can now calculate the pressure difference:\n\nP = 2 * σ / R\nP = 2 * 72 * 10^(-3) N/m / 0.0003 m\nP = 144 * 10^(-3) N/m / 0.0003 m\nP = 480,000 N/m^2\nP = 480 kPa (kilopascals)\n\nTherefore, the minimum pressure required for a spherical bubble of radius 0.3 mm to collapse due to cavitation in water is 480 kPa."
