    "message_2": "The minimum temperature and pressure required for hydrogen fusion to occur in stars and supernovae are approximately 10 million Kelvin (10^7 K) and 100 billion Pascals (10^11 Pa), respectively. These conditions are necessary for the protons in the hydrogen nuclei to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together, resulting in the fusion process.\n\nThe size and mass of a star are directly related to the temperature and pressure at its core, where hydrogen fusion occurs. More massive stars have higher gravitational forces, which compress their cores and increase the temperature and pressure. Consequently, more massive stars have higher fusion rates and shorter lifetimes, as they burn through their hydrogen fuel more quickly.\n\nIn general, a star must have a minimum mass of about 0.08 solar masses (M☉) to initiate hydrogen fusion in its core. This is known as the lower mass limit for a main-sequence star. Stars with masses below this threshold are called brown dwarfs and are unable to sustain hydrogen fusion. On the other hand, stars with masses above approximately 150 M☉ are thought to be unstable due to their extreme luminosity and radiation pressure, which can cause them to lose mass rapidly and potentially explode as supernovae."
