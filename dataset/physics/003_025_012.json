    "message_1": "A copper wire is shaped into a rectangular loop with sides measuring 2 cm and 4 cm. The wire has a resistance of 0.2 Ω and is connected to a 12 V battery. If there is a current of 1.5 A flowing through the wire, calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I) divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nHowever, since we have a rectangular loop, we need to modify the formula to account for the geometry of the loop. We can do this by dividing the loop into two parts, one with sides of 2 cm and the other with sides of 4 cm, and then calculating the magnetic field for each part separately.\n\nFor the 2 cm sides, the distance from the center of the loop to the wire is 1 cm. For the 4 cm sides, the distance from the center of the loop to the wire is 2 cm. We can now calculate the magnetic field for each part using the modified Ampere's Law formula:\n\nB₁ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₁)\nB₂ = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr₂)\n\nThe total magnetic field at the center of the loop is the sum of the magnetic fields from each part:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂\n\nGiven that the current flowing through the wire is 1.5 A, we can now calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop. The permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1.5 A) / (2π * 0.01 m) = 3 × 10^(-7) T\nB₂ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1.5 A) / (2π * 0.02 m) = 1.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ = 3 × 10^(-7) T + 1.5 × 10^(-7) T = 4.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 4.5 × 10^(-7) T."
