    "message_2": "The beta function for a scalar theory with a quartic interaction in two-dimensional space-time can be derived using perturbation theory and renormalization group techniques. The Lagrangian for this theory is given by:\n\nL = (1/2) (∂μφ) (∂^μφ) - (1/2) m^2 φ^2 - (λ/4!) φ^4,\n\nwhere φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the quartic coupling constant.\n\nThe beta function, β(λ), describes how the coupling constant λ changes under a renormalization group transformation. In two-dimensional space-time, the beta function for this theory can be computed using perturbative methods, such as the Callan-Symanzik equation or the Wilsonian approach. The result is:\n\nβ(λ) = - (1/2π) λ^2 + O(λ^3),\n\nwhere the O(λ^3) term represents higher-order corrections in the coupling constant.\n\nUnder a renormalization group transformation, the coupling constant λ changes according to the beta function. This transformation can be expressed as:\n\ndλ/dt = β(λ),\n\nwhere t is the logarithm of the renormalization scale. In this case, the beta function is negative, which implies that the coupling constant λ decreases as the renormalization scale increases. This behavior is characteristic of an asymptotically free theory in two-dimensional space-time."
