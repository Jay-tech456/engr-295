    "message_2": "The minimum mass required for a star to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. However, this limit is applicable to neutron stars, which are composed of neutrons and are the final stage of a massive star before it collapses into a black hole.\n\nFor a star composed entirely of hydrogen gas, we need to consider the minimum mass required for it to undergo nuclear fusion and eventually evolve into a black hole. This mass is known as the \"Chandrasekhar limit,\" which is approximately 1.4 solar masses (M☉). However, this limit is for white dwarfs, which are composed of electron-degenerate matter.\n\nIn reality, stars composed of hydrogen gas will undergo a series of nuclear fusion processes, starting with hydrogen fusion (main-sequence star), followed by helium fusion (red giant), and then heavier elements fusion (supernova). To form a black hole, a star must have an initial mass of at least 20 solar masses (M☉). This is because stars with lower masses will not have enough gravitational force to overcome the pressure from the nuclear fusion processes and will eventually end up as white dwarfs or neutron stars.\n\nIn summary, for a star composed entirely of hydrogen gas to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole, it must have an initial mass of at least 20 solar masses (M☉)."
