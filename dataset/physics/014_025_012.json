    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy of cosmic rays and their ability to cause mutations and genetic damage in organisms exposed to them is a complex one. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from various sources in the universe, such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and even the sun. When these particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere or other celestial bodies, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and gamma rays, which can penetrate the surface and potentially cause damage to living organisms.\n\nThe energy of cosmic rays is a crucial factor in determining their ability to cause genetic damage. Higher-energy cosmic rays are more likely to penetrate the protective layers of Earth's atmosphere and reach the surface, where they can interact with living organisms. Additionally, higher-energy particles are more likely to cause ionization in biological molecules, such as DNA, which can lead to mutations and genetic damage.\n\nThe impact of cosmic rays on the long-term evolution of life in the universe is a subject of ongoing research and debate. On one hand, cosmic rays can cause genetic damage and increase the mutation rate in organisms, which can lead to negative consequences such as increased risk of cancer and other diseases. However, mutations are also the driving force behind genetic variation and evolution. In some cases, cosmic ray-induced mutations may provide a selective advantage to an organism, allowing it to adapt to new environments or challenges.\n\nFurthermore, cosmic rays may have played a role in the origin of life itself. Some theories suggest that the energy provided by cosmic rays could have contributed to the formation of complex organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides, which are the building blocks of life. In this sense, cosmic rays may have been a catalyst for the emergence of life in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the energy of cosmic rays is directly related to their ability to cause mutations and genetic damage in organisms exposed to them. While this can have negative consequences for individual organisms, it may also contribute to the long-term evolution of life in the universe by promoting genetic variation and potentially even playing a role in the origin of life itself."
