    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current in the loop, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m and the current I = 2 A, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / (0.2π m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nB = (8 × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.2\n\nB = 4 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is 4 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
