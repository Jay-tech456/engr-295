    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of a silicon crystal, we can use the formula:\n\nα = ΔV / (V₀ * ΔT)\n\nwhere ΔV is the change in volume, V₀ is the initial volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial volume (V₀) of the silicon crystal. We are given the lattice constant (a) as 5.43 Å (angstroms), which is equal to 5.43 * 10^(-10) m. The volume of a cubic unit cell can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV₀ = a^3\n\nV₀ = (5.43 * 10^(-10) m)^3\nV₀ ≈ 1.602 * 10^(-28) m³\n\nNext, we need to find the change in volume (ΔV). We are given that the volume expands by 0.014% when heated from 25°C to 100°C. To find the change in volume, we can use the formula:\n\nΔV = V₀ * (percentage change / 100)\n\nΔV = (1.602 * 10^(-28) m³) * (0.014 / 100)\nΔV ≈ 2.243 * 10^(-31) m³\n\nNow, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT). We are given that the temperature increases from 25°C to 100°C, so:\n\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C\nΔT = 75°C\n\nFinally, we can calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) using the formula:\n\nα = ΔV / (V₀ * ΔT)\n\nα = (2.243 * 10^(-31) m³) / ((1.602 * 10^(-28) m³) * 75°C)\nα ≈ 1.863 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon crystal is approximately 1.863 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)."
