    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (u) is 40 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/40 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(40 + 2v) / (40 * v) = 1/20\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n20(40 + 2v) = 40 * v\n\n800 + 40v = 40v\n\nSince both sides have the same term (40v), they cancel each other out:\n\n800 = 0\n\nThis is not possible, so we made an error in our calculations. The correct formula should be:\n\n1/f = 1/u - 1/v\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\n1/20 = 1/40 - 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(2v - 40) / (40 * v) = 1/20\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n20(2v - 40) = 40 * v\n\n40v - 800 = 40v\n\nSince both sides have the same term (40v), they cancel each other out:\n\n-800 = 0\n\nThis is not possible, so we made an error in our calculations. The correct formula should be:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\n1/20 = 1/v - 1/40\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(40 - 2v) / (40 * v) = 1/20\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n20(40 - 2v) = 40 * v\n\n800 - 40v = 40v\n\nNow, add 40v to both sides:\n\n800 = 80v\n\nNow, divide both sides by 80:\n\nv = 800 / 80\n\nv = 10 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nM = -10/40\n\nM = -1/4\n\nSince the magnification is negative, it indicates that the image is inverted. The absolute value of the magnification gives the ratio of the image size to the object size. In this case, the image size is 1/4 of the object size."
