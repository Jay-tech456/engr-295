    "message_1": "The problem is: A particle of rest mass 2 GeV/c² decays into two fragments of equal mass. If the energy of one of the fragments is 3 GeV, what is the energy of the other fragment as measured in the rest frame of the decaying particle?",
    "message_2": "In the rest frame of the decaying particle, the total energy of the system is equal to the rest mass energy of the particle. Since the particle has a rest mass of 2 GeV/c², its total energy in its rest frame is:\n\nE_total = (2 GeV/c²) * c² = 2 GeV\n\nNow, the particle decays into two fragments of equal mass. Let's denote the energy of the first fragment as E1 and the energy of the second fragment as E2. According to the problem, E1 = 3 GeV. Since the total energy must be conserved, we have:\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n2 GeV = 3 GeV + E2\n\nSolving for E2, we find:\n\nE2 = 2 GeV - 3 GeV = -1 GeV\n\nHowever, the energy of a fragment cannot be negative. This means there is an inconsistency in the problem statement, and the given information cannot be true. Please double-check the problem statement for any errors or missing information."
