    "message_1": "A long, straight cylindrical wire of radius 3 mm is carrying a current of 5 A along its length. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the cylinder. Assume the permeability of free space is 4π × 10^-7 T m/A.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. For a long, straight wire carrying a current I, the magnetic field B at a distance r from the center of the wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 T m/A), I is the current (5 A), and r is the distance from the center of the wire (10 cm = 0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (2 × 10^-6 T m * 5) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 10^-5 T / 0.1 m\n\nB = 10^-4 T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the cylinder is 10^-4 T or 0.0001 T."
