    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of dark matter in a galaxy cluster using the observed gravitational lensing effects, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect observational data: Obtain the data on the positions, shapes, and brightness of the background galaxies that are being lensed by the galaxy cluster. This data can be collected using powerful telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n2. Determine the mass distribution of the galaxy cluster: Using the observational data, create a mass model of the galaxy cluster. This can be done using various techniques, such as the weak lensing method, which measures the distortion of background galaxy shapes due to the gravitational lensing effect. The mass distribution will include both the visible matter (stars, gas, etc.) and the dark matter.\n\n3. Subtract the visible matter: To estimate the amount of dark matter, we need to subtract the mass of the visible matter from the total mass distribution obtained in step 2. The visible matter can be estimated using the observed brightness of the galaxies in the cluster and their mass-to-light ratios.\n\n4. Calculate the dark matter mass: After subtracting the visible matter, the remaining mass in the mass distribution represents the dark matter in the galaxy cluster. This can be calculated by integrating the dark matter density over the volume of the galaxy cluster.\n\nIt's important to note that this method provides an estimate of the dark matter in the galaxy cluster, as there are uncertainties in the mass modeling and the mass-to-light ratios of the galaxies. However, this method has been widely used and has provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxy clusters."
