    "message_2": "The effective field theory of a non-relativistic atom coupled with a quantized electromagnetic field is described by the Hamiltonian that includes the atomic part, the electromagnetic field part, and the interaction between them. The atomic part is described by the Schrödinger equation, while the electromagnetic field is described by the quantized version of the Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian can be written as:\n\nH = H_atom + H_field + H_int\n\nwhere H_atom is the atomic Hamiltonian, H_field is the quantized electromagnetic field Hamiltonian, and H_int is the interaction Hamiltonian.\n\nH_atom = -ħ^2/(2m) ∇^2 + V(r)\n\nH_field = ∑_k ħω_k (a_k† a_k + 1/2)\n\nH_int = -e/c ∫ d^3r j(r)·A(r)\n\nHere, m is the mass of the electron, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, e is the electron charge, c is the speed of light, V(r) is the atomic potential, j(r) is the current density, A(r) is the vector potential, and a_k† and a_k are the creation and annihilation operators for the photons with wave vector k and frequency ω_k.\n\nTo calculate the leading order correction to the atom's energy levels due to the quantum field fluctuations, we can use the first-order perturbation theory. The first-order energy shift is given by:\n\nΔE_n = ⟨ψ_n|H_int|ψ_n⟩\n\nwhere |ψ_n⟩ is the unperturbed atomic wavefunction.\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need to express the interaction Hamiltonian in terms of the atomic wavefunctions and the photon creation and annihilation operators. Using the multipole expansion and considering only the electric dipole interaction, we can write the interaction Hamiltonian as:\n\nH_int = -d·E(r)\n\nwhere d is the electric dipole operator and E(r) is the electric field operator.\n\nNow, we can express the electric field operator in terms of the photon creation and annihilation operators:\n\nE(r) = ∑_k [E_k a_k e^(ik·r) + E_k* a_k† e^(-ik·r)]\n\nSubstituting this expression into the interaction Hamiltonian and calculating the matrix element, we get:\n\nΔE_n = -∑_k ⟨ψ_n|d·[E_k a_k e^(ik·r) + E_k* a_k† e^(-ik·r)]|ψ_n⟩\n\nThe leading order correction to the atom's energy levels due to the quantum field fluctuations can be obtained by evaluating this expression. In general, this will involve calculating the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator between the atomic wavefunctions and summing over all the photon modes. This can be a complicated task, but it is possible to obtain analytical or numerical results for specific atomic systems and approximations."
