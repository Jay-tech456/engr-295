    "message_1": "A student is given a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 20cm. An object measuring 2cm in height is placed 30cm in front of the mirror.\n\nWhat is the height of the image formed by the mirror, and is the image real or virtual?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the image formed by the convex mirror, we first need to determine the focal length (f) and then use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di). Finally, we can use the magnification equation to find the height of the image (hi).\n\n1. Find the focal length (f):\nFor a convex mirror, the focal length is half of the radius of curvature (R) and is positive.\nf = R/2\nf = 20cm / 2\nf = 10cm\n\n2. Use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di):\nThe mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance.\nRearrange the equation to solve for di: 1/di = 1/f - 1/do\nSubstitute the values: 1/di = 1/10 - 1/30\n1/di = (3 - 1) / 30\n1/di = 2/30\ndi = 30/2\ndi = 15cm\n\n3. Use the magnification equation to find the height of the image (hi):\nThe magnification equation is M = hi/ho = -di/do, where ho is the object height.\nRearrange the equation to solve for hi: hi = M * ho\nSubstitute the values: hi = (-di/do) * ho\nhi = (-15cm / 30cm) * 2cm\nhi = (-1/2) * 2cm\nhi = -1cm\n\nThe height of the image is 1cm (the negative sign indicates that the image is inverted). Since the image distance is positive, the image is virtual and upright."
