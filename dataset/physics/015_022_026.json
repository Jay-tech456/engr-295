    "message_2": "To predict the change in the binary star system's orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves, we can use the following formula derived from the general theory of relativity:\n\nΔP/P = -(96π/5) * (G²/c⁵) * (m₁m₂(M)/a⁴) * Δt\n\nwhere:\nΔP is the change in the orbital period,\nP is the initial orbital period,\nG is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²),\nc is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s),\nm₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two stars,\nM is the total mass of the system (m₁ + m₂),\na is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and\nΔt is the time interval over which we want to calculate the change in the orbital period.\n\nTo compare the predicted change to the observed change, we would need to have observational data for the binary star system, such as the masses of the stars, the semi-major axis, and the initial orbital period. With this information, we can calculate the predicted change in the orbital period and compare it to the observed change in the system's period.\n\nFor example, the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar (PSR B1913+16) is a well-known binary star system where the change in the orbital period due to gravitational wave emission has been observed. The observed change in the orbital period of this system is in excellent agreement with the predictions of general relativity, providing strong evidence for the existence of gravitational waves."
