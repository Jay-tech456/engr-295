    "message_2": "To find the thickness of the boundary layer, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\n- x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate\n- ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (ν = μ / ρ, where μ is the dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density)\n- U is the free-stream velocity of the fluid\n\nFirst, let's find the kinematic viscosity (ν):\n\nν = μ / ρ\nν = 0.001 Pa*s / 1000 kg/m³\nν = 1 * 10^(-6) m²/s\n\nNow, we need to know the distance (x) from the leading edge of the plate to calculate the boundary layer thickness. Since the plate is infinitely long, the boundary layer thickness will vary along the plate. Let's assume a distance x = 1 meter for this calculation:\n\nδ = (5 * 1 * (1 * 10^(-6) m²/s / 10 m/s))^(1/2)\nδ = (5 * 10^(-7))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ 0.001 m or 1 mm\n\nSo, at a distance of 1 meter from the leading edge of the plate, the thickness of the laminar boundary layer is approximately 1 mm. Keep in mind that this value will change depending on the distance from the leading edge."
