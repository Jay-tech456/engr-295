    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform numerical simulations directly. However, I can provide you with a general understanding of the problem and suggest a methodology to approach it.\n\nIn glassy materials, thermal conductivity is mainly governed by the vibrational modes of the atoms in the material. The presence of disorder in the material can affect these vibrational modes, leading to changes in the thermal conductivity. Generally, increasing disorder in a glassy material can lead to a decrease in thermal conductivity due to the increased scattering of phonons, which are the primary carriers of heat in such materials.\n\nTo investigate the behavior of thermal conductivity as a function of system size and disorder strength, you can perform numerical simulations using molecular dynamics or other atomistic simulation techniques. Here's a suggested methodology:\n\n1. Create a model of the glassy material: Start by creating a model of the glassy material using an appropriate interatomic potential. You can use a well-established potential for the material of interest or develop a new potential if necessary.\n\n2. Introduce disorder: Introduce disorder into the material by randomly displacing atoms from their equilibrium positions or by introducing defects such as vacancies or interstitials. The strength of the disorder can be controlled by the magnitude of the displacements or the concentration of defects.\n\n3. Perform simulations: Perform molecular dynamics or other atomistic simulations to compute the vibrational modes of the disordered material. You can use standard simulation packages such as LAMMPS, GROMACS, or NAMD for this purpose.\n\n4. Calculate thermal conductivity: Compute the thermal conductivity of the material using the Green-Kubo or other appropriate methods. The Green-Kubo method involves calculating the autocorrelation function of the heat current and integrating it over time.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Analyze the results of the simulations to determine the relationship between thermal conductivity, system size, and disorder strength. You can plot the thermal conductivity as a function of these parameters and compare the results to theoretical predictions.\n\n6. Compare to theoretical predictions: Compare your simulation results to theoretical predictions from existing models, such as the Anderson localization model or the percolation model. This will help you understand the underlying mechanisms governing the thermal conductivity of disordered glassy materials and validate your simulation methodology.\n\nBy following this methodology, you can gain insights into the effect of increasing disorder on the thermal conductivity of glassy materials and compare your findings to existing theoretical predictions."
