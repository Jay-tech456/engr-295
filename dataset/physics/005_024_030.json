    "message_2": "To calculate the age of the universe according to the standard cosmological model (also known as the Lambda-CDM model), we can use the Hubble constant (H0) and the Hubble time (tH). The Hubble time is an estimate of the age of the universe based on the inverse of the Hubble constant.\n\nThe Hubble constant (H0) is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. To use this value in our calculations, we first need to convert it to the appropriate units. We'll convert the Hubble constant to units of s^-1 (per second).\n\n1 Mpc (megaparsec) is equal to 3.086 x 10^19 km. So, we have:\n\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc * (1 Mpc / 3.086 x 10^19 km) = 70 / (3.086 x 10^19) s^-1 ≈ 2.268 x 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hubble time (tH) as the inverse of the Hubble constant:\n\ntH = 1 / H0 ≈ 1 / (2.268 x 10^-18 s^-1) ≈ 4.407 x 10^17 s\n\nTo convert this value to years, we can use the fact that there are approximately 3.1536 x 10^7 seconds in a year:\n\ntH ≈ 4.407 x 10^17 s * (1 year / 3.1536 x 10^7 s) ≈ 13.97 billion years\n\nSo, according to the standard cosmological model with a flat geometry and a Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc, the age of the universe is approximately 13.97 billion years."
