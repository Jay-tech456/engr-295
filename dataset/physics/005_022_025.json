    "message_2": "In relativistic electromagnetism, when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz transformation. The magnetic field in the particle's rest frame (B') is related to the magnetic field in the lab frame (B) by the following equation:\n\nB' = γ(B + v × E/c²)\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity of the particle, E is the electric field, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the particle is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, and there is no mention of an electric field. So, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nB' = γB\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nFor a particle moving at 0.8c, the Lorentz factor is:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 = 5/3\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the magnetic field experienced by the particle:\n\nB' = (5/3)(1.5 T) = 2.5 T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field experienced by the particle will be the same as the direction of the original magnetic field since the particle is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field experienced by the charged particle is 2.5 T, and the direction is the same as the original magnetic field."
