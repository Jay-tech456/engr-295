    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy of a helium nucleus (4He), we first need to determine the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the mass of the nucleus.\n\nA helium nucleus (4He) consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 amu.\n\nMass of 2 protons = 2 * 1.007276 amu = 2.014552 amu\nMass of 2 neutrons = 2 * 1.008665 amu = 2.017330 amu\nTotal mass of individual nucleons = 2.014552 amu + 2.017330 amu = 4.031882 amu\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nMass defect = Total mass of individual nucleons - Nuclear mass of 4He\nMass defect = 4.031882 amu - 4.002603 amu = 0.029279 amu\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg):\n\nMass defect (kg) = 0.029279 amu * 1.66053904×10^-27 kg/amu = 4.859715×10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, to calculate the binding energy in joules:\n\nBinding energy (J) = Mass defect (kg) * (speed of light)^2\nBinding energy (J) = 4.859715×10^-29 kg * (3.00×10^8 m/s)^2\nBinding energy (J) = 4.359×10^-12 J\n\nTo convert the binding energy from joules to megaelectronvolts (MeV), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602×10^-19 J:\n\nBinding energy (MeV) = (4.359×10^-12 J) / (1.602×10^-13 MeV/J) = 27.2 MeV\n\nSo, the binding energy of a helium nucleus (4He) is approximately 4.359×10^-12 J or 27.2 MeV."
