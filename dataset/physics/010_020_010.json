    "message_2": "To calculate the shear stress of a non-Newtonian fluid, we can use the power-law model, which is given by the following equation:\n\nτ = K * (du/dy)^n\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, K is the consistency index, du/dy is the shear rate, and n is the viscosity index (also known as the flow behavior index).\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nK = 200 Pa.s^n\nn = 0.4\ndu/dy = 50 s^-1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nτ = 200 * (50)^0.4\n\nTo calculate 50^0.4, we can use a calculator:\n\n50^0.4 ≈ 13.535\n\nNow, multiply this value by the consistency index:\n\nτ = 200 * 13.535\n\nτ ≈ 2707 Pa\n\nTherefore, the shear stress of the non-Newtonian fluid at a shear rate of 50 s^-1 is approximately 2707 Pa."
