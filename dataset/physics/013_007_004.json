    "message_2": "The rotation curve of spiral galaxies is a plot that shows the orbital velocities of visible stars and gas in a galaxy as a function of their distance from the galactic center. According to classical Newtonian physics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the rotation curve to show a decrease in orbital velocity as we move away from the center of the galaxy. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible mass should decrease with distance, leading to slower orbital velocities.\n\nHowever, observations of spiral galaxies show a different behavior. Instead of decreasing, the rotation curves tend to flatten out, with orbital velocities remaining roughly constant at large distances from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the expected and observed rotation curves is known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation for this phenomenon is the presence of dark matter in and around galaxies. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it is believed to interact with visible matter through gravity, influencing the motion of stars and gas in galaxies.\n\nThe flat rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies can be explained if there is a significant amount of dark matter distributed in a halo around the galaxy. The gravitational force exerted by this dark matter would cause the stars and gas at large distances from the galactic center to move at higher velocities than expected based on the visible mass alone. This additional mass, in the form of dark matter, would provide the extra gravitational force needed to keep the outer regions of the galaxy moving at a constant velocity.\n\nThus, the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in galactic structure and dynamics. The presence of dark matter helps to explain the discrepancy between the expected and observed rotation curves and has become a crucial component of our understanding of the composition and evolution of galaxies."
