    "message_2": "The deflection angle of light passing close to a Schwarzschild black hole can be calculated using the formula derived from General Relativity:\n\nΔφ = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere Δφ is the deflection angle, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the closest distance the light ray passes to the black hole).\n\nGiven a mass of 5 solar masses, we can convert it to kilograms:\n\nM = 5 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe values of G and c are:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nTo compare the deflection angle to the one predicted by gravitational lensing theory, we need to know the impact parameter b. However, since you didn't provide this value, we can only express the deflection angle as a function of b:\n\nΔφ(b) = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nFor a massive object of the same size, the deflection angle predicted by gravitational lensing theory would be the same as the one calculated using the formula above, as the formula is derived from the theory of General Relativity, which is the basis for gravitational lensing."
