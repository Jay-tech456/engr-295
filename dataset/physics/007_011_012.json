    "message_2": "The primary nuclear reaction that fuels the core of a star in its main-sequence phase is the proton-proton chain, which is a series of nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium. This process releases a large amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is what makes stars shine.\n\nAs the star evolves and exhausts its hydrogen fuel, the core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers of the star to expand. The star then enters the red giant phase. During this phase, the core temperature increases, and helium fusion begins through the triple-alpha process, which converts helium into carbon and oxygen.\n\nFor a star with an initial mass of 1 solar mass (like our Sun), its final fate will be to become a white dwarf. After the red giant phase, the outer layers of the star will be expelled, creating a planetary nebula. The remaining core, composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, will cool and contract, eventually forming a white dwarf. This white dwarf will continue to cool over billions of years, eventually becoming a black dwarf, which is a cold, dark, and inert stellar remnant."
