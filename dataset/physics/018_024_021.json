    "message_2": "The fine-structure constant (alpha) is a fundamental constant in physics that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is approximately equal to 1/137. The most precise measurement of the electron magnetic moment comes from the electron g-factor, which is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment of a particle.\n\nThe current best measurement of the electron g-factor is g/2 = 1.001 159 652 181 643(764) (source: CODATA 2018). The uncertainty in this measurement is given in the parentheses, which means the uncertainty is ±0.000 000 000 000 764.\n\nUsing this value of the electron g-factor, the fine-structure constant (alpha) can be determined. The current best value of alpha is α = 7.297 352 5693(11) × 10^(-3) (source: CODATA 2018). The uncertainty in this value is given in the parentheses, which means the uncertainty in alpha is ±0.000 000 0011.\n\nSo, the uncertainty in the electromagnetic constant (alpha) as determined from the most precise measurement of the electron magnetic moment is ±0.000 000 0011."
