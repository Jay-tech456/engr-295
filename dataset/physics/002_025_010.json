    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of a gas mixture, we can use the formula:\n\nCp(mixture) = Σ [xi * Cp(i)]\n\nwhere Cp(mixture) is the specific heat capacity of the mixture, xi is the mole fraction of each component in the mixture, and Cp(i) is the specific heat capacity of each individual component.\n\nFirst, let's find the mole fractions of each component in the mixture. Since the mixture is given in terms of volume percentages, we can assume that the mole percentages are the same, as the ideal gas law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of moles.\n\nMole fraction of nitrogen (N2) = 40%\nMole fraction of oxygen (O2) = 30%\nMole fraction of carbon dioxide (CO2) = 30%\n\nNow, let's find the specific heat capacities of each individual component at constant pressure (Cp) in units of J/(mol·K). These values can be found in standard reference tables or literature:\n\nCp(N2) = 29.1 J/(mol·K)\nCp(O2) = 29.4 J/(mol·K)\nCp(CO2) = 37.1 J/(mol·K)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula to find the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture:\n\nCp(mixture) = (0.40 * 29.1) + (0.30 * 29.4) + (0.30 * 37.1)\nCp(mixture) = 11.64 + 8.82 + 11.13\nCp(mixture) = 31.59 J/(mol·K)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the gas mixture at 1 atmosphere and 25°C is approximately 31.59 J/(mol·K)."
