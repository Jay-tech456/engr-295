    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the silicon crystal, we can use the formula:\n\nα = (ΔL / L₀) / ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in lattice constant, L₀ is the initial lattice constant at room temperature, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in lattice constant (ΔL):\n\nΔL = L_final - L_initial\nΔL = 5.50 Å - 5.43 Å\nΔL = 0.07 Å\n\nNext, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 400 K - 298 K\nΔT = 102 K\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula to find the thermal expansion coefficient (α):\n\nα = (0.07 Å / 5.43 Å) / 102 K\nα = (0.01289) / 102 K\nα = 1.26 × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹\n\nThe thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon crystal is approximately 1.26 × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹. Note that this value is different from the given linear coefficient of thermal expansion of silicon (2.6 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) because the thermal expansion coefficient is specific to the crystal and its lattice constants, while the linear coefficient of thermal expansion is a general property of the material."
