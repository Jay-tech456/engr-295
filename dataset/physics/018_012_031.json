    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength and frequency of a gamma-ray photon with energy above 100 GeV, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. Energy of a photon (E) is given by the equation: E = h * f, where h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\n2. The speed of light (c) is given by the equation: c = λ * f, where λ is the wavelength of the photon and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy from GeV to Joules. 1 GeV = 1 x 10^9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Therefore, 100 GeV = 100 x 10^9 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 1.602 x 10^-10 J.\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) using the energy equation:\n\n1.602 x 10^-10 J = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * f\nf = (1.602 x 10^-10 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 2.417 x 10^23 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can find the wavelength (λ) using the speed of light equation:\n\n3 x 10^8 m/s = λ * (2.417 x 10^23 Hz)\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.417 x 10^23 Hz) = 1.241 x 10^-15 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of a gamma-ray photon with energy above 100 GeV is approximately 1.241 x 10^-15 meters, and its frequency is approximately 2.417 x 10^23 Hz."
