    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole affects the paths of passing light rays due to its immense gravitational pull, which is a consequence of its extremely high mass concentrated in a very small volume. This strong gravitational field causes the spacetime around the black hole to curve, as predicted by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. When light rays pass close to the black hole, they follow the curvature of spacetime, causing their paths to bend. This bending of light rays is known as gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing can lead to several observable effects that can be used to detect and study black holes:\n\n1. Multiple images: When a distant light source, such as a star or a galaxy, is located behind a massive object like a black hole, the light rays can be bent in such a way that they reach the observer from different angles. This can create multiple images of the same object, which can be observed using telescopes.\n\n2. Magnification: Gravitational lensing can cause the light from a distant object to be focused and magnified, making it appear brighter and larger than it would be otherwise. This can help astronomers study objects that would be too faint or too small to be observed without the lensing effect.\n\n3. Einstein rings: In some cases, when the light source, the massive object (such as a black hole), and the observer are perfectly aligned, the lensing effect can create a circular image of the light source, known as an Einstein ring. This phenomenon can provide valuable information about the mass and size of the black hole causing the lensing.\n\n4. Microlensing: When a black hole passes in front of a distant star, the star's light can be temporarily magnified due to gravitational lensing. This short-lived brightening event is called microlensing, and it can be used to detect and study black holes that are not part of a binary system or are not actively accreting matter.\n\nBy observing these effects and analyzing the data, astronomers can infer the presence of a black hole, estimate its mass, and study its properties, even though the black hole itself cannot be directly observed due to its nature of not emitting any light."
