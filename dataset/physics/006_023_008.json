    "message_2": "The Bragg peak is a characteristic feature of the energy deposition by charged particles, such as protons or heavy ions, as they pass through a target material. The relationship between the energy of the charged particles and the depth of the Bragg peak can be described as follows:\n\nAs the charged particles travel through the target material, they lose energy due to interactions with the atoms in the material. This energy loss is primarily due to ionization and excitation processes. The energy loss per unit path length, also known as the stopping power, increases as the particle's energy decreases. Consequently, the charged particles slow down as they penetrate deeper into the material.\n\nThe Bragg peak occurs at a specific depth where the charged particles come to a stop and deposit a maximum amount of energy in a localized region. The depth of the Bragg peak is directly related to the initial energy of the charged particles. Higher energy particles will penetrate deeper into the target material before reaching their Bragg peak, while lower energy particles will have a shallower Bragg peak.\n\nThe energy of the charged particles also influences the dose distribution in the target material. In general, higher energy particles will have a more extended dose distribution, with a deeper Bragg peak and a broader penumbra (the region of gradually decreasing dose around the peak). Lower energy particles will have a more localized dose distribution, with a shallower Bragg peak and a narrower penumbra.\n\nThis property of charged particles is particularly useful in radiation therapy, where the goal is to deliver a high dose of radiation to a tumor while minimizing the dose to surrounding healthy tissues. By carefully selecting the energy of the charged particles, the Bragg peak can be positioned within the tumor, allowing for a more precise and effective treatment."
