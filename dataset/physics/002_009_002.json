    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to melt the ice cube, we need to first find the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of the ice from -5°C to 0°C, and then find the amount of heat needed to actually melt the ice at 0°C.\n\n1. Calculate the heat needed to raise the temperature of the ice from -5°C to 0°C:\n\nTo do this, we'll use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy, m is the mass of the ice, c is the specific heat capacity of ice, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.1 J/g°C. The mass of the ice cube (m) is 100 g, and the change in temperature (ΔT) is 5°C (from -5°C to 0°C).\n\nQ = (100 g) × (2.1 J/g°C) × (5°C) = 1050 J\n\nSo, 1050 Joules of heat energy are required to raise the temperature of the ice cube from -5°C to 0°C.\n\n2. Calculate the heat needed to melt the ice at 0°C:\n\nTo do this, we'll use the formula:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy, m is the mass of the ice, and L is the specific latent heat of fusion for ice.\n\nThe specific latent heat of fusion for ice is given as 334 J/g. The mass of the ice cube (m) is 100 g.\n\nQ = (100 g) × (334 J/g) = 33400 J\n\nSo, 33,400 Joules of heat energy are required to melt the ice cube at 0°C.\n\n3. Add the heat energy required for both steps:\n\nTotal heat energy (Q_total) = Q1 + Q2 = 1050 J + 33400 J = 34450 J\n\nTherefore, 34,450 Joules of heat energy are required to melt the ice cube from -5°C to water at 0°C."
