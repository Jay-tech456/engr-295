    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 3*di + 2*di\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\n60 = 5*di\n\nNext, divide by 5:\n\ndi = 60/5\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is 12 cm.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (M), we can use the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -12/30\n\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the lens is -0.4, which means the image is inverted and 0.4 times smaller than the object."
