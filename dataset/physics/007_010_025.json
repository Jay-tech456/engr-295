    "message_2": "To calculate the yield of a nuclear bomb in megatons of TNT, we need to first convert the energy released in joules to the energy equivalent in tons of TNT and then convert that to megatons of TNT.\n\n1 ton of TNT releases 4.184 x 10^9 joules of energy.\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy released by the nuclear bomb to the equivalent in tons of TNT:\n\n(2.5 x 10^17 joules) / (4.184 x 10^9 joules/ton) = 5.978 x 10^7 tons of TNT\n\nNow, let's convert tons of TNT to megatons of TNT:\n\n1 megaton of TNT = 1 million tons of TNT = 10^6 tons of TNT\n\n5.978 x 10^7 tons of TNT / (10^6 tons of TNT/megaton) = 59.78 megatons of TNT\n\nSo, the yield of the nuclear bomb is approximately 59.78 megatons of TNT."
