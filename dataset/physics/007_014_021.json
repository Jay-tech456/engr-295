    "message_2": "The liquid drop model is a semi-empirical model that estimates the binding energy of a nucleus. The binding energy is the energy required to disassemble a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. The liquid drop model is based on the idea that the nucleus behaves like a liquid drop, and it takes into account the volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing energies.\n\nThe binding energy (BE) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nBE = a_v * A - a_s * A^(2/3) - a_c * Z^2 / A^(1/3) - a_a * (A - 2Z)^2 / A + δ(A, Z)\n\nwhere:\n- A is the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons)\n- Z is the number of protons\n- a_v, a_s, a_c, and a_a are the volume, surface, Coulomb, and asymmetry coefficients, respectively\n- δ(A, Z) is the pairing term\n\nThe coefficients are empirically determined and have the following values:\n\na_v = 15.75 MeV\na_s = 17.8 MeV\na_c = 0.711 MeV\na_a = 23.7 MeV\n\nNow, let's calculate the binding energy for a nucleus with 55 protons and 135 neutrons:\n\nA = 55 + 135 = 190\nZ = 55\n\nBE = 15.75 * 190 - 17.8 * 190^(2/3) - 0.711 * 55^2 / 190^(1/3) - 23.7 * (190 - 2 * 55)^2 / 190\n\nNow, we need to calculate the pairing term δ(A, Z). The pairing term depends on whether the number of protons and neutrons are even or odd:\n\n- If both Z and N (number of neutrons) are even, δ(A, Z) = +a_p / A^(1/2)\n- If both Z and N are odd, δ(A, Z) = -a_p / A^(1/2)\n- If one is even and the other is odd, δ(A, Z) = 0\n\nThe pairing coefficient a_p is approximately 12 MeV. In our case, Z is odd and N is odd, so:\n\nδ(A, Z) = -12 / 190^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the binding energy:\n\nBE = 15.75 * 190 - 17.8 * 190^(2/3) - 0.711 * 55^2 / 190^(1/3) - 23.7 * (190 - 2 * 55)^2 / 190 - 12 / 190^(1/2)\n\nBE ≈ 2992.5 - 2235.5 - 122.7 - 328.5 + 7.4\nBE ≈ 1313.2 MeV\n\nTo find the binding energy per nucleon, we divide the binding energy by the total number of nucleons:\n\nBE_per_nucleon = 1313.2 MeV / 190\nBE_per_nucleon ≈ 6.91 MeV\n\nSo, the binding energy per nucleon for this nucleus is approximately 6.91 MeV."
