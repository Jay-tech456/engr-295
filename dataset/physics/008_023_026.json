    "message_2": "The production cross-sections for W and Z bosons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) depend on the collision energy, parton distribution functions, and the electroweak coupling constants. The ratio of the production cross-sections for W and Z bosons, often denoted as σ(W)/σ(Z), can be calculated using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and electroweak theory.\n\nThe ratio σ(W)/σ(Z) is not a constant value and varies with the collision energy. At the LHC, the center-of-mass collision energies have been 7 TeV, 8 TeV, and 13 TeV. For these energies, the approximate values of the ratio are:\n\n1. At 7 TeV: σ(W)/σ(Z) ≈ 10.4\n2. At 8 TeV: σ(W)/σ(Z) ≈ 10.6\n3. At 13 TeV: σ(W)/σ(Z) ≈ 10.8\n\nThese values are approximate and can vary depending on the specific details of the calculations, such as the choice of parton distribution functions and higher-order corrections. However, the ratio is relatively stable across different collision energies at the LHC, with only slight variations."
