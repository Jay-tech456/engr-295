    "message_2": "The relationship between the accretion rate (the rate at which matter falls into a black hole) and the luminosity (the amount of radiation emitted) of a black hole accretion disk can be described using the concept of radiative efficiency.\n\nRadiative efficiency (η) is the fraction of the rest mass energy of the accreted matter that is converted into radiation. In the case of a black hole accretion disk, the radiative efficiency depends on the black hole's spin and the properties of the accretion disk.\n\nThe luminosity (L) of the accretion disk can be expressed as a function of the accretion rate (Ṁ) and the radiative efficiency (η) using the following equation:\n\nL = η * Ṁ * c^2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this equation, the luminosity is directly proportional to the accretion rate. As the accretion rate increases, the luminosity of the accretion disk also increases. However, the radiative efficiency plays a crucial role in determining the actual amount of radiation emitted by the accretion disk.\n\nFor a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the radiative efficiency is around 5.7% (η ≈ 0.057). For a maximally rotating (Kerr) black hole, the radiative efficiency can be as high as 42% (η ≈ 0.42). This means that the luminosity of the accretion disk can be significantly higher for a rapidly rotating black hole compared to a non-rotating one, even if the accretion rates are the same.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the accretion rate and the luminosity of a black hole accretion disk is directly proportional, with the radiative efficiency playing a crucial role in determining the actual amount of radiation emitted. The luminosity increases with the accretion rate, and the radiative efficiency depends on the black hole's spin and the properties of the accretion disk."
