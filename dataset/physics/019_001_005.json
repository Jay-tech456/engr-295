    "message_2": "The Feynman diagram that describes the electron-electron scattering process at tree-level in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the t-channel exchange of a virtual photon between two incoming electrons and two outgoing electrons. This process is also known as Møller scattering.\n\nTo calculate the scattering amplitude, we will use the Feynman rules for QED:\n\n1. Assign a momentum to each external line (incoming and outgoing electrons).\n2. Conserve momentum at each vertex.\n3. Write down a propagator for each internal line (virtual photon).\n4. Write down a vertex factor for each vertex.\n5. Integrate over the internal momenta.\n\nLet the momenta of the incoming electrons be p1 and p2, and the momenta of the outgoing electrons be p3 and p4. The momentum of the virtual photon is q = p1 - p3.\n\nThe propagator for the virtual photon is given by:\n\nDμν(q) = -i gμν / (q^2 - m^2 + iε),\n\nwhere gμν is the metric tensor, m is the mass of the photon (which is zero), and ε is a small positive number.\n\nThe vertex factor for each vertex is given by:\n\n-i e γμ,\n\nwhere e is the electron charge and γμ are the Dirac matrices.\n\nThe scattering amplitude M is given by the product of the vertex factors and the propagator:\n\nM = (-i e γμ) (-i gμν / (q^2 + iε)) (-i e γν) = (ie)^2 γμ (gμν / (q^2 + iε)) γν.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cross-section of the process. The differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1/64π^2) (1/s) |M|^2,\n\nwhere s is the Mandelstam variable, s = (p1 + p2)^2.\n\nTo calculate |M|^2, we need to sum over the spins of the incoming and outgoing electrons and average over the spins of the incoming electrons:\n\n|M|^2 = (1/4) ∑spins |M|^2 = (1/4) tr[(u¯3 γμ u1) (u¯4 γν u2) (u¯1 γμ u3) (u¯2 γν u4)].\n\nThis trace calculation is quite involved, but after completing it, we can plug the result into the expression for the differential cross-section and integrate over the solid angle to obtain the total cross-section σ:\n\nσ = ∫ dσ/dΩ dΩ.\n\nThe final result for the cross-section will be in terms of the electron charge e and the energies of the incoming and outgoing electrons."
