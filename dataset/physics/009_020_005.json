    "message_2": "To find the angles for the first order maxima corresponding to yellow and blue light, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the maximum (in this case, n = 1 for the first order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the lines on the grating, and θ is the angle of the maximum.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 5000 lines per centimeter, we can convert this to meters:\n\n5000 lines/cm * (1 cm / 100 m) = 50000 lines/m\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the lines:\n\nd = 1 / 50000 = 2 * 10^(-5) m\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength of the red light. We know that the first order maximum for red light occurs at an angle of 20.0 degrees. Using the diffraction grating equation:\n\n1 * λ_red = (2 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(20.0°)\n\nλ_red = (2 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(20.0°) ≈ 6.84 * 10^(-7) m\n\nNow, let's assume that the wavelengths of yellow and blue light are approximately 580 nm and 470 nm, respectively. We can convert these to meters:\n\nλ_yellow = 580 * 10^(-9) m\nλ_blue = 470 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can use the diffraction grating equation to find the angles for the first order maxima corresponding to yellow and blue light:\n\n1 * λ_yellow = (2 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(θ_yellow)\nθ_yellow = arcsin(λ_yellow / (2 * 10^(-5) m)) ≈ 16.9°\n\n1 * λ_blue = (2 * 10^(-5) m) * sin(θ_blue)\nθ_blue = arcsin(λ_blue / (2 * 10^(-5) m)) ≈ 13.6°\n\nSo, the angles for the first order maxima corresponding to yellow and blue light are approximately 16.9° and 13.6°, respectively."
