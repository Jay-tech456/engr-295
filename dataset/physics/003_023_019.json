    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field created by the generator at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * r²) / (2 * (R² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current (2 A)\nN is the number of turns (50)\nr is the distance from the center of the coil (0.1 m)\nR is the radius of the coil\n\nHowever, we don't have the radius of the coil (R) given in the problem. To proceed with the calculation, we would need the radius of the coil. If you can provide the radius, we can calculate the magnetic field."
