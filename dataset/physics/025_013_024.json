    "message_2": "To correct far-sightedness (hyperopia) in an individual with a prescription of +2.5 diopters, we need to determine the focal length of the corrective lens. The power of a lens (measured in diopters) is the inverse of its focal length (measured in meters). \n\nPower (P) = 1 / Focal length (f)\n\nGiven the prescription of +2.5 diopters, we can calculate the focal length:\n\nf = 1 / P\nf = 1 / 2.5\nf = 0.4 meters (40 cm)\n\nNow, let's consider the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1 / f = (n - 1) * (1 / R1 - 1 / R2)\n\nHere, f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface. To find the refractive index, we need to know the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. However, this information is not provided in the problem.\n\nIn general, to correct hyperopia, the lens should be converging, which means it should be thicker in the center and thinner at the edges. This can be achieved by having a convex-convex lens shape, where both surfaces of the lens are curved outward. The exact refractive index and radii of curvature needed for the lens will depend on the specific lens material and design.\n\nIn summary, we can determine the focal length of the lens needed to correct a +2.5 diopter hyperopia prescription (0.4 meters), but we cannot determine the exact refractive index without more information about the lens material and design. The lens should be a converging lens with a convex-convex shape."
