    "message_2": "The optimal combination of plasma parameters for plasma-based processing to effectively eliminate harmful bacteria in food without affecting its nutritional quality or sensory characteristics depends on the specific food product and the type of bacteria targeted. However, some general guidelines can be provided based on existing research:\n\n1. Gas type: Non-thermal plasma can be generated using various gases, including air, nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and argon. The choice of gas depends on the desired reactive species to be produced and the food product being treated. For example, oxygen and air plasmas generate higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are effective in inactivating bacteria. Argon and helium plasmas generate higher concentrations of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which can also be effective against bacteria. A combination of gases can be used to optimize the generation of both ROS and RNS.\n\n2. Power: The power applied to generate the plasma influences the density of reactive species produced and the treatment's effectiveness. Higher power levels typically result in more effective bacterial inactivation. However, excessive power can lead to overheating and potential damage to the food product. Therefore, it is essential to find a balance between power and treatment time to achieve optimal bacterial inactivation without affecting the food's quality.\n\n3. Treatment time: The duration of plasma treatment is another critical factor in determining its effectiveness. Longer treatment times generally result in higher bacterial inactivation levels. However, extended treatment times can also lead to negative effects on the food's sensory and nutritional properties. Therefore, it is essential to find the optimal treatment time for each specific food product and bacterial strain.\n\nIn summary, the optimal combination of plasma parameters for food processing depends on the specific food product, the targeted bacteria, and the desired level of bacterial inactivation. Further research and experimentation are needed to determine the best combination of gas type, power, and treatment time for each specific application."
