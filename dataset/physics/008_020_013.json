    "message_2": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a hypothetical process in which the flavor of a lepton changes during a weak interaction. This process is not allowed in the Standard Model of particle physics, but it could occur in some extensions of the model. The experimental limits on LFV in rare decays are typically given in terms of branching ratios, which represent the probability of a particular decay mode occurring relative to all possible decay modes.\n\nSome of the most stringent limits on LFV come from searches for the decays of charged leptons, such as muons and taus, into other leptons and photons. Here are a few examples of current experimental limits:\n\n1. Muon decays:\n   - μ → eγ: The MEG experiment at PSI in Switzerland has set an upper limit on the branching ratio of B(μ → eγ) < 4.2 × 10^(-13) at 90% confidence level.\n   - μ → 3e: The SINDRUM experiment at PSI has set an upper limit on the branching ratio of B(μ → 3e) < 1.0 × 10^(-12) at 90% confidence level.\n\n2. Tau decays:\n   - τ → μγ: The Belle experiment in Japan has set an upper limit on the branching ratio of B(τ → μγ) < 4.4 × 10^(-8) at 90% confidence level.\n   - τ → eγ: The BaBar experiment in the USA has set an upper limit on the branching ratio of B(τ → eγ) < 3.3 × 10^(-8) at 90% confidence level.\n\nFuture experiments can improve these limits by increasing the sensitivity of the detectors, collecting more data, and employing advanced analysis techniques. Some of the planned or ongoing experiments that aim to improve the limits on LFV include:\n\n1. MEG-II: This upgraded version of the MEG experiment aims to improve the sensitivity to the μ → eγ decay by a factor of 10 compared to the current limit.\n\n2. Mu3e: This experiment at PSI aims to search for the μ → 3e decay with a sensitivity up to four orders of magnitude better than the current limit.\n\n3. Belle II: This upgraded version of the Belle experiment aims to collect 50 times more data than its predecessor, which will allow it to improve the limits on various LFV decays involving tau leptons.\n\n4. LHCb: The LHCb experiment at CERN is also searching for LFV in decays of B mesons, which could provide complementary information to the direct searches for charged lepton decays.\n\nBy improving the experimental limits on LFV, physicists hope to gain insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, grand unified theories, or lepton flavor violation in neutrino oscillations."
