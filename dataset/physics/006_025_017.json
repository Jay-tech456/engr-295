    "message_2": "The energy released during the complete fission of one nucleus of Uranium-235 is approximately 200 MeV (Mega-electron volts), which is equal to 3.2 x 10^-11 Joules. This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, as well as the energy carried away by the emitted neutrons and gamma rays.\n\nIn the fusion of four hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form one helium nucleus, the energy released is approximately 26.7 MeV (4.28 x 10^-12 Joules). This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the helium nucleus and the emitted particles, such as neutrinos and gamma rays.\n\nComparing the two processes, the energy released during the fission of one Uranium-235 nucleus is significantly higher than the energy released during the fusion of four hydrogen nuclei to form one helium nucleus. Specifically, the energy released in the fission process is about 7.5 times greater than that released in the fusion process. However, it is important to note that fusion reactions have the potential to release more energy per unit mass of fuel when compared to fission reactions, making fusion a more efficient energy source in the long run."
