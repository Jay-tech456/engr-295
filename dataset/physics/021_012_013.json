    "message_2": "The theoretical maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a rotating black hole is given by the Penrose process, which was proposed by the British physicist Roger Penrose in 1969. According to this process, up to 29% of a rotating black hole's mass-energy can be converted into useful energy.\n\nThe Penrose process occurs in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which is a region outside the event horizon where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime along with it. In this region, it is possible for particles to have negative energy relative to an observer at infinity.\n\nTo harness this energy, one would need to introduce a particle into the ergosphere. This particle would then split into two, with one of the particles having negative energy and falling into the black hole, while the other escapes with positive energy. The net effect is that the black hole loses mass, and the escaping particle carries away energy.\n\nIn practice, harnessing energy from a rotating black hole would be extremely challenging due to the immense gravitational forces, the need to transport and manipulate particles near the black hole, and the vast distances involved in reaching a black hole. Additionally, the process would require an advanced understanding of the physics involved and the development of technologies far beyond our current capabilities.\n\nOne speculative idea for harnessing energy from a rotating black hole is through the use of a hypothetical megastructure called a Dyson swarm, which would consist of a large number of satellites orbiting the black hole and collecting energy from the particles escaping the ergosphere. However, this concept is purely theoretical and far from being realized with our current technology and understanding of black holes."
