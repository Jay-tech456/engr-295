    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nOne possibility for the composition of dark matter is dark radiation, which refers to hypothetical particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter and radiation. These particles could be similar to neutrinos, which are known to exist and have very small masses and weak interactions with other particles. Some candidates for dark radiation include sterile neutrinos, axions, and other hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nThere are several pieces of evidence that support the possibility of dark matter being composed of dark radiation:\n\n1. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB have revealed small temperature fluctuations that can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Some models suggest that dark radiation could have played a role in shaping these fluctuations.\n\n2. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Dark radiation could have influenced the formation of these structures by altering the expansion rate of the universe and the growth of density fluctuations.\n\n3. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies indicate that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter. This additional mass could be in the form of dark radiation, which would exert a gravitational influence on the visible matter in the galaxy.\n\nIf dark matter is indeed composed of dark radiation, it could have significant implications for our understanding of the origins and evolution of the universe. For example, it could provide insights into the nature of the early universe, the formation of large-scale structures, and the behavior of fundamental forces and particles. Additionally, the discovery of dark radiation could help to resolve some of the outstanding problems in cosmology, such as the nature of dark energy and the observed discrepancy between the predicted and observed amounts of matter in the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no direct evidence for dark matter being composed of dark radiation, several lines of indirect evidence support this possibility. If confirmed, this could have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe's origins and evolution."
