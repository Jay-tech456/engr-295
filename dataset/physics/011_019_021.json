    "message_2": "To calculate the new lattice constant after heating the crystal, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length (or lattice constant in this case), L₀ is the initial lattice constant, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the change in temperature (ΔT). Assuming room temperature is 298 K (approximately 25°C), the change in temperature when heated to 500 K is:\n\nΔT = 500 K - 298 K = 202 K\n\nNow we can calculate the change in lattice constant (ΔL):\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\nΔL = (0.5 nm) * (5 x 10^-6 K^-1) * (202 K)\nΔL ≈ 0.000505 nm\n\nFinally, we can find the new lattice constant by adding the change in lattice constant to the initial lattice constant:\n\nNew lattice constant = L₀ + ΔL\nNew lattice constant ≈ 0.5 nm + 0.000505 nm\nNew lattice constant ≈ 0.500505 nm\n\nSo, the new lattice constant of the crystal when heated to 500 K is approximately 0.500505 nm."
