    "message_2": "The minimum number of qubits required for a quantum error-correcting code to detect and correct a single error caused by a bit flip or phase flip is 5. This is known as the 5-qubit code or the Shor code, named after Peter Shor who first proposed it.\n\nThe 5-qubit code encodes a single logical qubit into a 5-qubit entangled state. The encoding process is as follows:\n\n1. Prepare the initial state of the logical qubit, either |0⟩ or |1⟩.\n2. Apply a series of controlled-NOT (CNOT) and Hadamard gates to entangle the 5 qubits.\n\nThe resulting encoded states are:\n\n|0⟩_L = (|00000⟩ + |11100⟩ + |11011⟩ + |00111⟩ + |10010⟩ + |01110⟩ + |01001⟩ + |10101⟩)/√8\n|1⟩_L = (|11111⟩ + |00011⟩ + |00100⟩ + |11000⟩ + |01101⟩ + |10001⟩ + |10110⟩ + |01010⟩)/√8\n\nTo detect and correct bit flip errors, we can use two ancillary qubits and perform a series of CNOT gates between the data qubits and the ancillary qubits. By measuring the ancillary qubits, we can determine which, if any, of the data qubits experienced a bit flip error and correct it.\n\nTo detect and correct phase flip errors, we first apply Hadamard gates to all data qubits, transforming phase flip errors into bit flip errors. Then, we can use the same procedure as for bit flip errors to detect and correct the errors. Finally, we apply Hadamard gates again to return the data qubits to their original states.\n\nIn summary, the 5-qubit code can detect and correct a single error caused by a bit flip or phase flip using a combination of entangled states, CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, and ancillary qubits for error detection and correction."
