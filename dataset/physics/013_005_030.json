    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation today is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), which is just a few degrees above absolute zero. This low temperature is a result of the expansion and cooling of the universe since the Big Bang, which occurred around 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThe CMB radiation is a relic from the early universe, and its discovery provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory. It is the thermal radiation left over from the time when the universe was much hotter and denser, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. At that time, the universe had cooled enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms, allowing photons to travel freely without being scattered by charged particles. This process is known as recombination, and the CMB radiation is a snapshot of the universe at that time.\n\nThe near-uniform temperature of the CMB across the sky, with only tiny fluctuations, tells us that the early universe was remarkably homogeneous and isotropic. These small temperature fluctuations, however, are crucial for understanding the formation of large-scale structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters. The fluctuations are the result of tiny density variations in the early universe, which eventually grew under the influence of gravity to form the cosmic structures we observe today.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation today is about 2.725 K, and its existence and properties provide strong evidence for the Big Bang theory and offer insights into the conditions and processes in the early universe."
