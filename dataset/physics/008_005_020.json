    "message_2": "The theoretical basis of the strong force and confinement lies in the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is a part of the Standard Model of particle physics. QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory based on the SU(3) group, which describes the interactions between quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of strongly interacting particles such as protons and neutrons.\n\nIn QCD, the strong force is mediated by gluons, which carry a \"color charge.\" Quarks come in three different colors (red, green, and blue), and anti-quarks have corresponding anti-colors. The strong force acts between quarks and anti-quarks with different color charges, and gluons themselves carry a color and an anti-color charge. This property leads to the self-interaction of gluons, which is a unique feature of the strong force compared to other fundamental forces.\n\nConfinement is a phenomenon in which quarks and gluons are never observed as free particles but are always confined within hadrons (composite particles made up of quarks and gluons). This is due to the peculiar behavior of the strong force, which becomes stronger as the distance between quarks increases. When quarks are close together, the strong force is weak, but when they are pulled apart, the force increases, making it energetically unfavorable for quarks to exist freely.\n\nExperimental observations supporting the strong force and confinement come from various high-energy physics experiments, such as those conducted at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). These experiments have provided evidence for the existence of quarks and gluons and their interactions, as well as the confinement phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most significant experimental observations supporting confinement is the absence of free quarks and gluons in high-energy scattering experiments. Instead, only color-neutral hadrons are observed. Additionally, the study of deep inelastic scattering experiments has provided indirect evidence for the existence of quarks inside protons and neutrons, as well as their fractional electric charges.\n\nAnother important piece of evidence comes from the study of the strong force's behavior at different energy scales. As the energy scale increases, the strong force becomes weaker, a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. This behavior has been experimentally observed in various processes, such as electron-positron annihilation into hadrons and deep inelastic scattering.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical basis of the strong force and confinement is rooted in quantum chromodynamics, which describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. Experimental observations from high-energy physics experiments provide strong evidence for the existence of quarks, gluons, and the confinement phenomenon, supporting the QCD framework."
