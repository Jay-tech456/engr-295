    "message_2": "The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for a process, such as the binding of a ligand to a protein, can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, ΔS is the entropy change, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven the values of ΔH and ΔS, you can calculate ΔG by plugging in the values and the temperature into the equation."
