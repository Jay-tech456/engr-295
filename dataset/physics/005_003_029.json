A second spaceship travels at a velocity of 0.8c in the same direction as the first spaceship relative to Earth. What is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship?\"",
    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity of the second spaceship with respect to the first spaceship, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv = (0.6c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48c^2 / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nv = 1.4c / 1.48\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.946c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship is approximately 0.946c."
