    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at a speed of 85% of the speed of light passes by a space station. According to observers on the spaceship, the distance between the spaceship and the space station is 2000 meters while the time it takes to pass the space station is 6 microseconds. What is the time and distance between the spaceship and the space station according to observers on the space station? Use Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lorentz transformation equations for both space and time coordinates. Let's denote the spaceship frame as S' and the space station frame as S. The relative velocity between the two frames is v = 0.85c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (gamma), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.85c)^2 / c^2)\nγ ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.7225)\nγ ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.2775)\nγ ≈ 1.903\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the distance and time according to observers on the space station.\n\nFor the distance (x) transformation, we have:\n\nx = γ(x' + vt')\n\nIn this case, x' = 2000 meters (the distance according to the spaceship), and t' = 6 microseconds (the time according to the spaceship). We can convert the time to seconds: t' = 6 * 10^(-6) seconds.\n\nx = 1.903(2000 + 0.85c * 6 * 10^(-6))\nx ≈ 1.903(2000 + 0.85 * 3 * 10^8 * 6 * 10^(-6))\nx ≈ 1.903(2000 + 1530)\nx ≈ 1.903 * 3530\nx ≈ 6720.59 meters\n\nFor the time (t) transformation, we have:\n\nt = γ(t' + (v/c^2)x')\n\nt = 1.903(6 * 10^(-6) + (0.85c / c^2) * 2000)\nt ≈ 1.903(6 * 10^(-6) + 0.85 * 2000 / 3 * 10^8)\nt ≈ 1.903(6 * 10^(-6) + 0.00000567)\nt ≈ 1.903 * 0.00001167\nt ≈ 2.22 * 10^(-5) seconds\n\nConverting the time back to microseconds, we get:\n\nt ≈ 22.2 microseconds\n\nSo, according to observers on the space station, the distance between the spaceship and the space station is approximately 6720.59 meters, and the time it takes for the spaceship to pass the space station is approximately 22.2 microseconds."
