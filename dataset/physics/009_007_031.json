    "message_2": "To find the height of the image formed on the screen, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm, and the screen is placed 30 cm in front of the mirror (v = -30 cm, since it's a real image), we can find the object distance (u).\n\n1/10 = 1/u - 1/30\n1/u = 1/10 + 1/30\n1/u = 3/30 + 1/30\n1/u = 4/30\nu = -30/4\nu = -7.5 cm (negative sign indicates the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow we can use the magnification formula to find the height of the image (h'):\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u = h'/h\n\nWhere h is the object's height, and h' is the image's height.\n\nm = -(-30)/(-7.5) = 30/7.5 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the height of the image (h'):\n\nh' = m * h\nh' = 4 * 5\nh' = 20 cm\n\nSo, the height of the image formed on the screen is 20 cm."
