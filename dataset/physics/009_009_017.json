    "message_2": "To calculate the position, nature, and size of the image formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven:\nf = -20 cm (concave lens focal length is negative)\nu = -40 cm (object distance is negative as it is on the same side as the light source)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/(-40)\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-20) + 1/(-40)\n1/v = (-2 + 1) / 40\n1/v = -1/40\n\nv = -40 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is a characteristic of a virtual image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = v/u\n\nm = (-40)/(-40)\nm = 1\n\nSince the magnification is 1, the size of the image is the same as the size of the object.\n\nSo, the image formed by the concave lens is a virtual, erect image located 40 cm from the lens on the same side as the object, and it has the same size as the object."
