    "message_2": "To design a quantum cellular automaton (QCA) for simulating the evolution of a 3-qubit system, we will first define the initial state and the quantum gate to be applied. In this case, the initial state is |001⟩ and the quantum gate is a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate with the control qubit being the first qubit and the target qubit being the second qubit.\n\nInitial state: |001⟩\n\nQuantum gate: CNOT (Control: first qubit, Target: second qubit)\n\nThe CNOT gate can be represented by the following matrix:\n\nCNOT = | 1 0 0 0 |\n       | 0 1 0 0 |\n       | 0 0 0 1 |\n       | 0 0 1 0 |\n\nNow, we will apply the CNOT gate to the initial state. Since we have a 3-qubit system, we need to extend the CNOT gate to act on three qubits. We can do this by taking the tensor product of the CNOT gate with the identity matrix I (2x2) for the third qubit:\n\nCNOT_3qubit = CNOT ⊗ I = | 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |\n                         | 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 |\n                         | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 |\n                         | 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 |\n                         | 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 |\n                         | 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 |\n                         | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |\n                         | 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |\n\nNow, we can apply the CNOT_3qubit gate to the initial state |001⟩:\n\nFinal state = CNOT_3qubit * |001⟩\n\nTo do this, we first represent the initial state as a column vector:\n\n|001⟩ = | 0 |\n         | 0 |\n         | 1 |\n         | 0 |\n         | 0 |\n         | 0 |\n         | 0 |\n         | 0 |\n\nNow, we can multiply the CNOT_3qubit matrix with the initial state vector:\n\nFinal state = | 0 |\n              | 0 |\n              | 0 |\n              | 1 |\n              | 0 |\n              | 0 |\n              | 0 |\n              | 0 |\n\nThis final state corresponds to the state |011⟩. Therefore, after applying the CNOT gate with the control qubit being the first qubit and the target qubit being the second qubit, the final state of the 3-qubit system is |011⟩."
