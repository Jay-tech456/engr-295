    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nIn this case, we can consider a circular loop with a radius of 5 cm (0.05 m) inside the toroid. The total current enclosed by this loop will be proportional to the fraction of the total area of the toroid enclosed by the loop.\n\nFirst, let's find the total area of the toroid (A_total). The toroid has an inner radius (r1) of 10 cm - 5 cm = 5 cm (0.05 m) and an outer radius (r2) of 10 cm (0.1 m). The total area of the toroid can be calculated as the difference between the areas of two circles with radii r1 and r2:\n\nA_total = π(r2^2 - r1^2) = π(0.1^2 - 0.05^2) = π(0.01 - 0.0025) = π(0.0075) m²\n\nNow, let's find the area enclosed by the circular loop with a radius of 5 cm (A_loop):\n\nA_loop = π(0.05^2) = π(0.0025) m²\n\nThe fraction of the total area enclosed by the loop is:\n\nFraction = A_loop / A_total = (π(0.0025)) / (π(0.0075)) = 0.0025 / 0.0075 = 1/3\n\nSince the total current flowing through the toroid is 2 A, the current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed) is:\n\nI_enclosed = Fraction × Total current = (1/3) × 2 A = 2/3 A\n\nNow we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field (B) at a point inside the toroid with a radial distance of 5 cm from its center:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀ × I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular loop, we can write:\n\nB × 2πr = μ₀ × I_enclosed\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ × I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) × (2/3) A) / (2π × 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 3\n\nB ≈ 8.38 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point inside the toroid with a radial distance of 5 cm from its center is approximately 8.38 × 10^(-7) T."
