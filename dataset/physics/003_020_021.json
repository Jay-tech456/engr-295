    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field intensity at a point above the midpoint of the capacitor plates, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the plates, we can use Ampere's law to simplify the calculation.\n\nAmpere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the enclosed current (I):\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a parallel plate capacitor, the magnetic field lines are circular around the current-carrying wires. We can consider a circular loop with a radius r = 0.05 m (the distance above the midpoint of the capacitor plates) centered on the midpoint between the plates.\n\nThe magnetic field (B) is constant along this loop, so we can write:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the integral of dl around the loop is the circumference of the circle (2πr), we can write:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = μ₀I / (2πr)\n\nWe are given the current (I) as 3 A, and the permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 3 A) / (2π × 0.05 m)\n\nThe A (amperes) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-7) Tm × 3) / 0.05 m\n\nB = 6 × 10^(-7) T / 0.05 m\n\nB ≈ 1.2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field intensity at a point 0.05 m above the midpoint of the capacitor plates is approximately 1.2 × 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
