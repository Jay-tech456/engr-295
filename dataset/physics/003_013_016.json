    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since we are dealing with a circular loop, we can use the formula derived from the Biot-Savart Law for this specific case. The formula for the magnetic field B at a point on the axis of a circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + d²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field at point P\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current flowing through the loop\n- R is the radius of the circular loop\n- d is the distance of point P from the center of the loop\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of I, R, and d into the formula to find the magnetic field B at point P."
