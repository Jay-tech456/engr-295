    "message_2": "The observed relationship between the size of highly luminous quasars and the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers is based on the concept of the Eddington luminosity. Quasars are extremely bright and distant active galactic nuclei powered by accretion of matter onto SMBHs. The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity that a celestial body (like a quasar) can achieve when there is a balance between the gravitational force pulling matter inwards and the radiation pressure pushing it outwards.\n\nThe relationship between the quasar's luminosity and the mass of the SMBH is given by the Eddington luminosity formula:\n\nL_edd = 4 * π * G * M * m_p * c / σ_T\n\nwhere L_edd is the Eddington luminosity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the SMBH, m_p is the proton mass, c is the speed of light, and σ_T is the Thomson scattering cross-section for an electron.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the Eddington luminosity is directly proportional to the mass of the SMBH. Therefore, more massive SMBHs can support more luminous quasars. Observations have shown that there is a strong correlation between the mass of SMBHs and the luminosity of quasars, which supports the theoretical predictions.\n\nIn addition, the size of the quasar's accretion disk, which is the region where matter spirals inwards towards the SMBH, is also related to the mass of the SMBH. The larger the mass of the SMBH, the larger the accretion disk can be, and the more luminous the quasar will appear.\n\nIn summary, current astronomical observations and theories suggest a positive correlation between the size (luminosity) of highly luminous quasars and the mass of the supermassive black holes at their centers. More massive SMBHs can support more luminous quasars, and they are also expected to have larger accretion disks."
