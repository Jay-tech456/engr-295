From the frame of reference of the spaceship, at what angle will the beam of light appear to be travelling when observed from Earth due to relativistic aberration?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the beam of light appears to be travelling when observed from Earth, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(1 + βcos(θ)))\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the light beam in the spaceship's frame of reference, θ' is the angle of the light beam in Earth's frame of reference, β is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity to the speed of light (0.8 in this case), and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nSince the beam of light is emitted from the front of the spaceship towards Earth, the angle θ in the spaceship's frame of reference is 0 degrees. Therefore, cos(θ) = 1 and sin(θ) = 0. Now, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.8^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nsin(θ') = sin(0) / (1.6667(1 + 0.8 * 1)) = 0 / (1.6667 * 1.8) = 0\n\nSince sin(θ') = 0, the angle θ' in Earth's frame of reference is also 0 degrees. This means that the beam of light will appear to be travelling directly towards Earth when observed from Earth, despite the spaceship's relativistic velocity."
