    "message_2": "The highest energy photon ever detected in high-energy gamma-ray astronomy was observed by the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) observatory in Namibia in 2019. This photon had an energy of about 1 petaelectronvolt (PeV), or 1 x 10^15 electronvolts (eV).\n\nThe photon was associated with the Crab Nebula, which is the remnant of a supernova explosion that occurred in 1054 AD. The process that produced this ultra-high-energy photon is believed to involve the acceleration of charged particles, such as electrons and protons, within the strong magnetic fields and shock waves present in the Crab Nebula. These accelerated particles interact with surrounding photons and magnetic fields, leading to the emission of high-energy gamma rays through processes like inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation."
