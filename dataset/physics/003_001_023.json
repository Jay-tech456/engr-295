    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, for an infinitely long straight wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which simplifies the calculation. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the current I = 3 A and the distance r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 120π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.77 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced by the straight wire carrying a current of 3 A at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is approximately 3.77 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
