    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a high-temperature superconductor is the temperature below which the material exhibits superconductivity, meaning it can conduct electricity with zero electrical resistance. High-temperature superconductors have a Tc higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K or -196 °C), which makes them more practical for applications compared to low-temperature superconductors that require more expensive cooling methods.\n\nThe exact value of the critical temperature depends on the specific material being used as a superconductor. For example, Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) has a Tc of around 92 K (-181 °C), while Bismuth Strontium Calcium Copper Oxide (BSCCO) has a Tc of around 110 K (-163 °C). \n\nThe relationship between the critical temperature and the ability to conduct electricity with zero resistance is that when the temperature of the superconductor is below its Tc, the material undergoes a phase transition. In this superconducting state, the electrons in the material form Cooper pairs, which can move through the lattice without any energy loss due to scattering or resistance. This allows the superconductor to carry electrical current with zero resistance. However, if the temperature rises above the critical temperature, the Cooper pairs break apart, and the material loses its superconducting properties, exhibiting normal electrical resistance."
