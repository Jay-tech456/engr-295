    "message_2": "To calculate the work done on the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial\nΔV = 10 L - 2.5 L\nΔV = 7.5 L\n\nNow, we need to convert the pressure from atm to a unit that is compatible with the volume in liters. We can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 atm = 101.325 J/L\n\nSo, the pressure in J/L is:\n\nP = 1 atm * 101.325 J/L\nP = 101.325 J/L\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\nW = -(101.325 J/L) * (7.5 L)\n\nW = -759.9375 J\n\nThe work done on the gas during this isothermal expansion is approximately -759.94 J. Since the work is negative, it means that the gas has done work on its surroundings (i.e., it has expanded)."
