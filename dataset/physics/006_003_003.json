    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of energy levels in an atom due to the presence of an external magnetic field. In the case of hydrogen, the energy levels are primarily determined by the principal quantum number n. However, when a magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are further split depending on the magnetic quantum number m.\n\nTo calculate the change in energy levels, we can use the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (0.5 T), and Δm is the change in the magnetic quantum number (which can be -1, 0, or 1).\n\nFor a transition between two energy levels with Δm = 1:\n\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * 1\nΔE ≈ 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength of the radiation emitted using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nλ ≈ (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.637 x 10^-24 J)\nλ ≈ 4.29 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the radiation emitted is approximately 4.29 x 10^-7 m, or 429 nm, which falls in the violet region of the visible light spectrum."
