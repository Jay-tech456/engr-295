    "message_2": "Renormalization is a technique used in quantum field theory (QFT) to deal with infinities that arise in calculations involving interacting particles. These infinities are a result of the self-interactions of particles, which lead to divergent contributions to their physical properties, such as mass and charge. Renormalization is a systematic procedure to remove these infinities and obtain finite, measurable values for these properties.\n\nLet's consider the example of an electron in quantum electrodynamics (QED), the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. In QED, the electron interacts with the electromagnetic field via the exchange of virtual photons. Due to these interactions, the electron's mass and charge are \"dressed\" by the surrounding cloud of virtual particles, leading to a shift in their values compared to the \"bare\" mass and charge of the electron.\n\nThe mass of the electron can be calculated using its propagator, which describes the probability amplitude for the electron to propagate from one spacetime point to another. The propagator contains a term called the self-energy, which accounts for the self-interactions of the electron. The self-energy is represented by a loop diagram in which the electron emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon. This loop diagram leads to a divergent contribution to the electron's mass.\n\nTo deal with this divergence, we apply the renormalization procedure. First, we introduce a regularization scheme, such as dimensional regularization or a momentum cutoff, to make the divergent integral finite. Next, we separate the self-energy into two parts: a divergent part and a finite part. The divergent part is absorbed into a redefinition of the bare mass of the electron, while the finite part gives a physical correction to the electron's mass.\n\nThe physical meaning behind renormalization is that the observed mass of the electron is not its bare mass, but rather the sum of its bare mass and the finite correction due to its self-interactions with the electromagnetic field. The renormalized mass is the experimentally measurable mass of the electron, which is finite and well-defined.\n\nIn summary, renormalization is a crucial technique in quantum field theory that allows us to deal with the infinities arising from particle self-interactions. By applying renormalization, we can obtain finite, measurable values for the physical properties of particles, such as their mass and charge. In the example of an electron in QED, renormalization alters the mass estimation by accounting for the self-interactions of the electron with the electromagnetic field, leading to a finite, experimentally observable mass."
