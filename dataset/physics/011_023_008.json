    "message_2": "When an external magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, it affects the magnetic properties of the magnetic domain walls within the material. The magnetic domain walls are the boundaries between regions (domains) where the magnetization vector is aligned in different directions. The external magnetic field interacts with the magnetic moments of the atoms within the material, causing changes in the domain structure.\n\nThe main effects of an external magnetic field on the magnetic properties of a magnetic domain wall in a ferromagnetic material are:\n\n1. Domain wall movement: When an external magnetic field is applied, it exerts a force on the magnetic moments within the domain walls, causing them to align with the field direction. This results in the movement of the domain walls, leading to the expansion of domains with magnetization aligned with the field and the shrinking of domains with magnetization opposite to the field. This process is known as domain wall motion or domain wall propagation.\n\n2. Domain wall pinning: In real ferromagnetic materials, there are defects and impurities that can act as pinning sites for domain walls. When an external magnetic field is applied, the domain walls can be pinned at these sites, preventing them from moving freely. The strength of the external magnetic field must be increased to overcome the pinning force and cause the domain wall to move.\n\n3. Domain wall structure modification: The external magnetic field can also affect the structure of the domain walls. For example, it can cause the formation of new domain walls, change the thickness of existing domain walls, or modify the angle between the magnetization vectors in adjacent domains.\n\n4. Magnetic anisotropy: The external magnetic field can also influence the magnetic anisotropy of the material, which is the directional dependence of the magnetic properties. This can lead to changes in the preferred orientation of the magnetization vectors within the domains, affecting the overall magnetic behavior of the material.\n\nIn summary, the external magnetic field has a significant impact on the magnetic properties of a magnetic domain wall in a ferromagnetic material. It can cause domain wall movement, pinning, structural modification, and changes in magnetic anisotropy, all of which can affect the overall magnetic behavior of the material."
