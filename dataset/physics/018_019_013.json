    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of top quark pair production through the strong interaction in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, we need to consider the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the protons, the strong coupling constant, and the cross-section for the process.\n\nThe probability of top quark pair production can be expressed as the product of the parton distribution functions for the interacting partons (quarks and gluons), the strong coupling constant (αs), and the partonic cross-section for the process (σ). The partonic cross-section can be calculated using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at a given order in the strong coupling constant.\n\nThe PDFs depend on the momentum fraction of the partons (x) and the factorization scale (Q^2), which is typically chosen to be the mass of the top quark squared (m_top^2). The PDFs can be obtained from global fits to experimental data, such as those provided by the CTEQ, MSTW, or NNPDF collaborations.\n\nThe strong coupling constant depends on the renormalization scale (μ_R), which is also typically chosen to be the mass of the top quark. The value of αs at this scale can be obtained from the world average, which is αs(m_top) ≈ 0.108.\n\nTo calculate the probability of top quark pair production, we need to integrate the product of the PDFs, αs, and σ over the range of momentum fractions and factorization scales relevant for the process. This can be done using numerical integration techniques and specialized software tools, such as MadGraph or MCFM.\n\nThe resulting probability can then be compared to predictions from the Standard Model of particle physics. The Standard Model provides a framework for calculating the cross-section for top quark pair production as a function of the center-of-mass energy and other parameters. The comparison between the calculated probability and the Standard Model predictions can be used to test the validity of the model and search for deviations that might indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nIn summary, calculating the probability of top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV requires considering the parton distribution functions, the strong coupling constant, and the partonic cross-section for the process. The resulting probability can be compared to predictions from the Standard Model to test the model's validity and search for new physics."
