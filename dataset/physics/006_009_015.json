    "message_2": "To find the change in wavelength after Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, λ' is the final wavelength, h is the Planck constant, m_e is the rest mass of the electron, c is the speed of light, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven values:\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^-9 m\nθ = 45 degrees = π/4 radians (conversion from degrees to radians)\nm_e = 9.11 * 10^-31 kg\nh = 6.626 * 10^-34 J.s\nc = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 * 10^-34) / (9.11 * 10^-31 * 3 * 10^8) * (1 - cos(π/4))\nΔλ ≈ 2.43 * 10^-12 m\n\nThe change in wavelength of the photon after undergoing Compton scattering is approximately 2.43 * 10^-12 m or 2.43 pm (picometers)."
