    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (vacuum), I is the current flowing through the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is a constant value equal to 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nGiven the current I = 3 A and the distance r = 4 cm = 0.04 m, we can now calculate the magnetic field strength B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow we can simplify and calculate B:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.08 m)\nB = 1.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is 1.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
