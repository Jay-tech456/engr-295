    "message_2": "The critical temperature at which the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) transitions to the hadron gas phase is approximately 150-170 MeV (Mega-electron volts), which corresponds to about 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin.\n\nSeveral variables can affect this phase transition in high-energy physics:\n\n1. Temperature: The phase transition occurs at a specific temperature range, as mentioned above. When the system is heated to this temperature, quarks and gluons become deconfined, forming the QGP.\n\n2. Baryon chemical potential: This is a measure of the net baryon density in the system. At high baryon chemical potential, the transition from QGP to hadron gas phase can occur at lower temperatures.\n\n3. Energy density: The energy density of the system plays a crucial role in the phase transition. Higher energy densities favor the formation of QGP, while lower energy densities lead to the hadron gas phase.\n\n4. Pressure: The pressure of the system can also influence the phase transition. Higher pressures can lead to the formation of QGP, while lower pressures favor the hadron gas phase.\n\n5. Strong force coupling constant: The strength of the strong force between quarks and gluons can affect the phase transition. If the coupling constant is large, it may be more difficult for the system to undergo the phase transition.\n\n6. Initial conditions: The initial conditions of the system, such as the distribution of energy and matter, can influence the phase transition. Different initial conditions can lead to different paths for the system to reach the critical temperature and undergo the phase transition."
