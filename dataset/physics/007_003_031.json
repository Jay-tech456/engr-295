Additionally, calculate the amount of nuclear fuel required to generate 1 GW of power for 1 year, assuming an energy output of 200 MeV per fission and a fuel burnup of 40 GWd/MTU.",
    "message_2": "To find the average thermal efficiency of a nuclear power plant, we can use the following formula:\n\nThermal efficiency = (Conversion efficiency) * (Overall plant efficiency)\n\nGiven the conversion efficiency of 33% (0.33) and the overall plant efficiency of 85% (0.85), we can calculate the thermal efficiency:\n\nThermal efficiency = 0.33 * 0.85 = 0.2805\n\nSo, the average thermal efficiency of a nuclear power plant is 28.05%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of nuclear fuel required to generate 1 GW of power for 1 year. First, let's convert the power output to energy:\n\n1 GW = 1,000,000 kW\n\n1 year = 365 days * 24 hours/day = 8,760 hours\n\nEnergy generated in 1 year = Power output * Time\nEnergy generated in 1 year = 1,000,000 kW * 8,760 hours = 8,760,000,000 kWh\n\nNow, we need to find the energy produced per fission event:\n\n200 MeV = 200 * 10^6 eV\n1 eV = 1.60218 * 10^-19 J\n\nEnergy per fission = 200 * 10^6 eV * 1.60218 * 10^-19 J/eV = 3.20436 * 10^-11 J\n\nTo find the number of fission events required to generate the energy, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of fission events = Total energy / Energy per fission\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy generated in 1 year to Joules:\n\n8,760,000,000 kWh * 3.6 * 10^6 J/kWh = 3.1536 * 10^16 J\n\nNumber of fission events = 3.1536 * 10^16 J / 3.20436 * 10^-11 J = 9.841 * 10^26\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of nuclear fuel required. Given the fuel burnup of 40 GWd/MTU:\n\n1 MTU = 1,000,000 grams\n\nEnergy produced per gram of fuel = (40 GWd/MTU) / (1,000,000 grams/MTU)\nEnergy produced per gram of fuel = 40 * 10^9 W * 24 * 3600 s / 1,000,000 g = 3.456 * 10^9 J/g\n\nTo find the amount of nuclear fuel required, we can use the following formula:\n\nAmount of nuclear fuel (grams) = Total energy / Energy produced per gram of fuel\n\nAmount of nuclear fuel (grams) = 3.1536 * 10^16 J / 3.456 * 10^9 J/g = 9.124 * 10^6 g\n\nTo convert the amount of nuclear fuel to metric tons:\n\nAmount of nuclear fuel (metric tons) = 9.124 * 10^6 g / 1,000,000 g/MTU = 9.124 MTU\n\nSo, the amount of nuclear fuel required to generate 1 GW of power for 1 year is approximately 9.124 metric tons."
