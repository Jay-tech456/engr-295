    "message_2": "The Debye-Hückel limiting law is used to estimate the activity coefficient (γ) of an electrolyte in a solution. The equation is given by:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * |z+ * z-| * √I\n\nwhere:\nγ = activity coefficient\nA = Debye-Hückel constant (0.509 for 25°C)\nz+ and z- = charges of the cation and anion, respectively\nI = ionic strength of the solution\n\nFor sodium chloride (NaCl), the charges of the cation (Na+) and anion (Cl-) are both 1. The ionic strength is given as 0.1 M. We can now plug these values into the equation:\n\nlog(γ) = -0.509 * |1 * -1| * √0.1\nlog(γ) = -0.509 * 1 * 0.3162\nlog(γ) = -0.161\n\nNow, we can find the activity coefficient (γ) by taking the antilog of the result:\n\nγ = 10^(-0.161)\nγ ≈ 0.69\n\nTherefore, the activity coefficient of a 1 M solution of sodium chloride at 25°C using the Debye-Hückel limiting law is approximately 0.69."
