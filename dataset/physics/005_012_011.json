    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of an electron, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the electron (0.8c).\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.4 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2.4 × 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.667\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.667 - 1) × (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 0.667 × (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) × (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 5.46 × 10^-31 kg × 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nK.E. ≈ 4.914 × 10^-14 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the electron is approximately 4.914 × 10^-14 joules."
