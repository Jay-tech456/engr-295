    "message_2": "To calculate the total mass of a star-forming region in the interstellar medium, we can use the formula for the mass of a sphere:\n\nMass (M) = (4/3) * π * r^3 * ρ\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere, and ρ (rho) is the average density of the star-forming region.\n\nGiven the radius (r) and average density (ρ) of the star-forming region, we can plug these values into the formula to find the total mass (M)."
