    "message_2": "To find the vapor pressure of ethanol at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 38.56 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 38.56 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 38560 J/mol\n\nWe are also given the normal boiling point of ethanol (T1) as 78.4°C, which we need to convert to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 78.4°C + 273.15 = 351.55 K\n\nAt the normal boiling point, the vapor pressure (P1) is equal to 1 atm, which we need to convert to Pa:\n\nP1 = 1 atm * (101325 Pa/1 atm) = 101325 Pa\n\nWe are asked to find the vapor pressure at 25°C (T2), which we need to convert to Kelvin:\n\nT2 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -38560 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/351.55 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2/101325) ≈ 1.542\nP2/101325 = e^1.542\nP2 ≈ 101325 * e^1.542\nP2 ≈ 69476.6 Pa\n\nThe vapor pressure of ethanol at 25°C is approximately 69476.6 Pa."
