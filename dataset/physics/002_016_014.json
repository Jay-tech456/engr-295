    "message_1": "\"What is the critical temperature of a substance if its pressure is 3.5 MPa and volume is 2.1 m³ when the substance undergoes a phase change from gas to liquid?\"",
    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of a substance, we can use the critical point properties and the van der Waals equation of state. The critical point is the point at which the substance's gas and liquid phases coexist in equilibrium. The van der Waals equation of state is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)²)(V/n - b) = RT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are the van der Waals constants specific to the substance.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate the critical temperature using this equation. We need to know the substance's van der Waals constants (a and b) and the number of moles (n) of the substance.\n\nIf you can provide the substance's van der Waals constants and the number of moles, we can proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, it's not possible to determine the critical temperature with the given information."
