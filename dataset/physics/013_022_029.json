    "message_2": "The mechanism that drives mass accretion in the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is primarily due to the gravitational attraction of the black hole. In the early stages of a black hole's formation, it starts as a stellar-mass black hole, which forms from the collapse of a massive star. As the black hole attracts nearby gas and dust, an accretion disk forms around it. This disk consists of material that spirals inwards towards the black hole due to the loss of angular momentum caused by friction and other processes.\n\nAs the material in the accretion disk gets closer to the black hole, it heats up due to the increasing gravitational energy and friction, emitting radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves. This radiation can exert pressure on the surrounding gas, causing it to be pushed away from the black hole. However, if the radiation pressure is not strong enough to overcome the gravitational pull of the black hole, the gas will continue to spiral inwards and eventually be accreted onto the black hole, increasing its mass.\n\nThe relationship between the mass accretion rate and the growth rate of SMBHs can be described by the Eddington limit, which is the maximum rate at which a black hole can accrete mass without the radiation pressure becoming strong enough to blow away the infalling material. The Eddington limit is proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that more massive black holes can accrete material at a higher rate.\n\nThe growth rate of a black hole can be expressed as the change in mass over time (dM/dt), which is directly related to the mass accretion rate. If a black hole is accreting mass at the Eddington limit, its growth rate will be at its maximum, and the black hole will grow exponentially over time. However, if the accretion rate is lower than the Eddington limit, the growth rate will be slower, and the black hole will take longer to reach a supermassive state.\n\nIn summary, the mass accretion in the formation of SMBHs is driven by gravitational attraction and the dynamics of the accretion disk. The relationship between the mass accretion rate and the growth rate of these objects is governed by the Eddington limit, which sets an upper limit on the rate at which a black hole can grow."
