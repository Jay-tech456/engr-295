    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first and second minima in the single-slit diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for the angular position of minima in single-slit diffraction:\n\nθ = arcsin(m * λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minima, m is the order of the minima (m = 1 for the first minima, m = 2 for the second minima), λ is the wavelength of the laser beam, and d is the slit width.\n\nGiven:\nλ = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\nd = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nFor the first minima (m = 1):\nθ1 = arcsin(1 * 633 * 10^(-9) / 0.2 * 10^(-3))\nθ1 ≈ 0.00316 radians\n\nFor the second minima (m = 2):\nθ2 = arcsin(2 * 633 * 10^(-9) / 0.2 * 10^(-3))\nθ2 ≈ 0.00632 radians\n\nNow, to find the intensity distribution of the first and second minima, we can use the formula for the intensity in single-slit diffraction:\n\nI(θ) = I0 * (sin(π * d * sin(θ) / λ) / (π * d * sin(θ) / λ))^2\n\nwhere I(θ) is the intensity at angle θ, I0 is the maximum intensity at the center of the diffraction pattern, and the other variables are as defined earlier.\n\nFor minima, the intensity I(θ) is zero. Therefore, the intensity distribution at the first and second minima is zero.\n\nIn summary, the angular positions of the first and second minima are approximately 0.00316 radians and 0.00632 radians, respectively, and the intensity distribution at both minima is zero."
