    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. When these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and other charged particles. These secondary particles can penetrate the Earth's surface and even reach living organisms.\n\nThe DNA of living organisms is susceptible to damage from various sources, including ionizing radiation produced by cosmic rays. When cosmic rays or their secondary particles collide with the atoms in DNA molecules, they can cause ionization, which results in the removal of one or more electrons from the atoms. This process can lead to the breaking of chemical bonds within the DNA, causing single or double-strand breaks, base damage, or crosslinks between DNA strands.\n\nIf the DNA damage is not repaired correctly, it can lead to mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence. Some mutations can be harmful, leading to diseases such as cancer, while others can be neutral or even beneficial, providing an advantage to the organism in its environment. In this way, cosmic rays can contribute to the genetic diversity of living organisms and play a role in the process of evolution.\n\nThe effect of cosmic rays on the evolution of life in the universe is still a subject of ongoing research. Some scientists hypothesize that cosmic rays could have played a role in the origin of life on Earth by providing the energy needed to synthesize complex organic molecules from simpler precursors. Additionally, cosmic rays could potentially influence the evolution of life on other planets or moons, particularly those with weaker magnetic fields or thinner atmospheres that provide less protection against cosmic radiation.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays can affect the DNA of living organisms by causing ionization and subsequent damage to the DNA molecules. This damage can lead to mutations, which can contribute to the genetic diversity and evolution of life. The role of cosmic rays in the origin and evolution of life in the universe is an intriguing area of research with many unanswered questions."
