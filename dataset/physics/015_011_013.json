    "message_2": "The expected rate of detection of gravitational waves by future observatories depends on several factors, including advancements in detector sensitivity, the types of sources being observed, and the overall improvement in data analysis techniques.\n\nCurrently, the primary observatory for detecting gravitational waves is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which has been operational since 2015. Together with the Virgo observatory in Europe, they have detected over 50 gravitational wave events, primarily from binary black hole mergers and a few binary neutron star mergers.\n\nThe planned upgrades to LIGO, known as Advanced LIGO Plus (A+), are expected to increase the sensitivity of the detectors by a factor of 2-3, which would allow them to observe a volume of space up to 3-8 times larger than the current observatories. This could potentially increase the detection rate to several hundred events per year.\n\nAdditionally, new observatories are being planned or are under construction, such as the KAGRA detector in Japan and the LIGO-India project. These additional detectors will not only increase the overall detection rate but also improve the localization of the gravitational wave sources in the sky, which is crucial for follow-up observations with telescopes and other instruments.\n\nIn the more distant future, space-based observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to launch in the 2030s. LISA will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, allowing it to detect a wider variety of sources, such as supermassive black hole mergers and compact binaries in our own galaxy. The detection rate for LISA is expected to be in the thousands of events per year.\n\nIn summary, the expected rate of detection of gravitational waves by future observatories is likely to be significantly higher than the current rate, potentially reaching several hundred to thousands of events per year. This increase will be due to improvements in detector sensitivity, the addition of new observatories, and the ability to observe a wider range of gravitational wave sources."
