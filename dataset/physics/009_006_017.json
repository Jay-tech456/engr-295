    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the focal length of a concave mirror that produces an inverted image of a candle that is placed 20 cm in front of it. The height of the candle is 2 cm and the image is formed at a distance of 15 cm from the mirror. What is the focal length of the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To determine the focal length of the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance (distance between the candle and the mirror), and v is the image distance (distance between the image and the mirror).\n\nGiven, u = 20 cm and v = -15 cm (negative sign because the image is formed on the same side as the object in a concave mirror).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-15)\n1/f = (15 - 20) / (20 * -15)\n1/f = -5 / (-300)\n\nNow, we can find the focal length (f):\n\nf = -300 / -5\nf = 60 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the concave mirror is 60 cm."
