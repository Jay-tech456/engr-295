    "message_2": "Topological insulators and topological semimetals are both novel classes of materials that exhibit unique electronic properties due to their non-trivial topological band structures. However, there are key differences between them, which result in their distinct electronic properties.\n\n1. Band structure and electronic properties:\n\nTopological Insulators (TIs): In topological insulators, the bulk of the material behaves as an insulator, meaning that there is a bandgap between the valence and conduction bands. However, the surface or edges of the material host metallic states, which are topologically protected. These surface states form a single Dirac cone, where the valence and conduction bands touch at a single point (the Dirac point). The electronic properties of TIs are characterized by the presence of these gapless, spin-polarized surface states that are robust against non-magnetic impurities and defects.\n\nTopological Semimetals (TSMs): In topological semimetals, the valence and conduction bands also touch, but they do so in the bulk of the material, not just at the surface. Depending on the specific type of TSM, the band touching can occur at isolated points (Weyl semimetals) or along lines (nodal-line semimetals). The electronic properties of TSMs are characterized by the presence of these bulk gapless states, which can lead to exotic phenomena such as chiral anomaly and large negative magnetoresistance.\n\n2. Topological invariants:\n\nTopological invariants are mathematical quantities that describe the topological properties of a material's band structure. They are different for topological insulators and topological semimetals.\n\nTIs: Topological insulators are characterized by a non-zero topological invariant, such as the Z2 invariant in time-reversal invariant TIs or the Chern number in quantum Hall systems. These invariants guarantee the existence of the topologically protected surface states.\n\nTSMs: Topological semimetals are characterized by different topological invariants, such as the Chern number for Weyl semimetals or the winding number for nodal-line semimetals. These invariants describe the topological properties of the bulk band structure and the associated gapless states.\n\n3. Dimensionality:\n\nTIs: Topological insulators can exist in various dimensions, such as 2D (quantum spin Hall insulators) or 3D (strong topological insulators). In each case, the topologically protected states are confined to the lower-dimensional boundaries (edges or surfaces) of the material.\n\nTSMs: Topological semimetals typically exist in 3D, with the bulk band touching points or lines defining their topological properties. However, there are also 2D analogs, such as 2D Weyl semimetals, where the band touching occurs at isolated points in the 2D Brillouin zone.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between topological insulators and topological semimetals lie in their band structures, electronic properties, topological invariants, and dimensionality. Topological insulators have insulating bulk and metallic surface states, while topological semimetals have bulk gapless states. These differences result in distinct electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies."
