    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum system is highly sensitive to initial conditions, making it a classic example of a chaotic system. A double pendulum consists of two pendulums connected end-to-end, with the first pendulum's bob connected to a pivot point and the second pendulum's bob connected to the end of the first pendulum. The motion of the system is governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations that depend on the angles and angular velocities of the two pendulums.\n\nThe initial conditions of the system, such as the initial angles (θ1 and θ2) and initial angular velocities (ω1 and ω2) of the two pendulums, play a crucial role in determining the overall motion of the system. Even small changes in the initial conditions can lead to drastically different trajectories and behaviors of the double pendulum.\n\nHere are some general observations about the effect of initial conditions on the motion of a double pendulum system:\n\n1. If both initial angles are small (close to 0), the motion of the system will be relatively simple and periodic, resembling the motion of two coupled simple pendulums.\n\n2. As the initial angles increase, the motion of the system becomes more complex and less predictable. The pendulums can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, including oscillations, rotations, and chaotic motion.\n\n3. Changing the initial angular velocities can also have a significant impact on the motion of the system. For example, if one pendulum starts with a higher initial velocity, it can transfer energy to the other pendulum, causing it to swing more wildly.\n\n4. In general, the motion of a double pendulum system is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and small changes in the initial angles or velocities can lead to drastically different trajectories. This sensitivity to initial conditions is a hallmark of chaotic systems and makes it difficult to predict the long-term behavior of a double pendulum.\n\nIn summary, the initial conditions of a double pendulum system, including the initial angles and angular velocities of the two pendulums, have a significant impact on the overall motion of the system. The motion can range from simple and periodic to highly complex and chaotic, depending on the specific initial conditions. This sensitivity to initial conditions is a key characteristic of chaotic systems and makes the double pendulum an interesting and challenging system to study."
