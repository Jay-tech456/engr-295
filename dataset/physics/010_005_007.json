    "message_2": "To determine the drag force and lift force acting on the sphere when it reaches terminal velocity, we need to consider the forces acting on the sphere: gravitational force (weight), buoyancy force, and drag force. At terminal velocity, these forces are balanced, and the net force is zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume and mass of the sphere:\nVolume (V) = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere.\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 0.5m / 2 = 0.25m\nV = (4/3)π(0.25)³ = 0.06545 m³\n\nMass (m) = Density (ρ) × Volume (V)\nm = 2000 kg/m³ × 0.06545 m³ = 130.9 kg\n\nNow, let's find the gravitational force (weight) acting on the sphere:\nWeight (W) = Mass (m) × Gravitational acceleration (g)\nW = 130.9 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 1283.7 N\n\nNext, let's find the buoyancy force acting on the sphere:\nBuoyancy force (B) = Density of water (ρ_water) × Volume (V) × Gravitational acceleration (g)\nB = 1000 kg/m³ × 0.06545 m³ × 9.81 m/s² = 641.85 N\n\nAt terminal velocity, the net force is zero, so the drag force (D) is equal to the difference between the weight and the buoyancy force:\nD = W - B = 1283.7 N - 641.85 N = 641.85 N\n\nSince the sphere is denser than the water, it will not experience any lift force. The lift force is zero.\n\nIn summary, the drag force acting on the sphere when it reaches a terminal velocity of 0.5 m/s is 641.85 N, and the lift force is 0 N."
