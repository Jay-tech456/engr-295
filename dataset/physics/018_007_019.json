    "message_2": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical concept in particle physics that proposes a symmetry between fermions (particles with half-integer spins, like electrons and quarks) and bosons (particles with integer spins, like photons and gluons). In supersymmetry, every known particle has a yet undiscovered \"superpartner\" with a spin differing by 1/2. These superpartners are expected to be heavier than their standard model counterparts, and their existence could help explain the missing mass in the universe.\n\nThe missing mass problem arises from the observation that the visible matter in the universe, such as stars and galaxies, is not enough to account for the gravitational effects observed at large scales. This discrepancy led to the hypothesis of dark matter, a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible. Dark matter is estimated to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nSupersymmetry can potentially explain the missing mass in the universe through the existence of these superpartners. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a prime candidate for dark matter. The LSP is expected to be stable, electrically neutral, and only weakly interacting with other particles, which are the desired properties for a dark matter particle. In many supersymmetric models, the LSP is the neutralino, a mixture of the superpartners of neutral gauge bosons and Higgs bosons.\n\nExperimental evidence for supersymmetry is still lacking, as no superpartners have been directly observed in particle collider experiments, such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. However, there are indirect hints that supersymmetry might be a valid theory. For example, the unification of the three fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong) at high energies is more consistent in the context of supersymmetry than in the Standard Model alone.\n\nMoreover, the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, with a mass around 125 GeV, is consistent with the predictions of some supersymmetric models. Additionally, some astrophysical observations, such as the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which could be composed of supersymmetric particles.\n\nIn summary, supersymmetry offers a potential explanation for the missing mass in the universe through the existence of superpartners, with the lightest supersymmetric particle being a candidate for dark matter. While there is no direct experimental evidence for supersymmetry yet, indirect hints and consistency with some observations keep it as an active area of research in particle physics. Future experiments at the LHC and other particle colliders, as well as astrophysical observations and dark matter detection experiments, will continue to search for evidence of supersymmetry and its potential role in explaining the missing mass in the universe."
