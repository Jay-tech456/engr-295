    "message_2": "The critical temperature at which the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition occurs is approximately 150-170 MeV (million electron volts), which corresponds to about 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin.\n\nAt temperatures below the critical temperature, quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. This is due to the strong force, which is mediated by gluons and becomes stronger as quarks are separated. This confinement is a key feature of the QCD phase known as the hadronic phase.\n\nWhen the temperature rises above the critical temperature, the QCD phase transition occurs, and quarks and gluons are no longer confined within hadrons. Instead, they form a new state of matter called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this state, quarks and gluons can move freely over larger distances, and the strong force between them becomes weaker. This deconfinement is a characteristic of the QGP phase.\n\nThe QCD phase transition and the behavior of quarks and gluons in the quark-gluon plasma are important for understanding the early universe, as it is believed that the QGP existed shortly after the Big Bang. Additionally, studying the QCD phase transition and the properties of the QGP can provide insights into the fundamental nature of the strong force and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions."
