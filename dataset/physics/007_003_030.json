    "message_2": "The efficiency of a power plant can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Useful output power / Input power) × 100%\n\nIn this case, the useful output power is the electrical power produced, which is 500 megawatts, and the input power is the thermal power output of the reactor, which is 1500 megawatts.\n\nEfficiency = (500 MW / 1500 MW) × 100%\n\nEfficiency = (1/3) × 100%\n\nEfficiency = 33.33%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the nuclear power plant is 33.33%."
