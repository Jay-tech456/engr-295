    "message_2": "In the fusion of two deuterium atoms to form helium-4, the reaction can be represented as:\n\nD + D → He-4 + energy\n\nHere, D represents a deuterium atom (hydrogen-2), which has one proton, one neutron, and one electron.\n\nTo calculate the energy released in this reaction, we need to find the difference in mass between the reactants (two deuterium atoms) and the product (helium-4), and then convert this mass difference to energy using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².\n\nMass of one deuterium atom = 2.014 amu (atomic mass units)\nMass of helium-4 atom = 4.0026 amu\n\nMass difference:\n2 * 2.014 amu - 4.0026 amu = 0.0254 amu\n\nNow, we need to convert this mass difference to energy. First, we'll convert amu to kilograms:\n\n1 amu = 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg\n\n0.0254 amu = 0.0254 * 1.66054 × 10^(-27) kg = 4.219 × 10^(-29) kg\n\nNow, we'll use Einstein's equation, E=mc², to find the energy:\n\nE = (4.219 × 10^(-29) kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)²\nE ≈ 3.797 × 10^(-12) Joules\n\nSo, approximately 3.797 × 10^(-12) Joules of energy is released from the fusion of two deuterium atoms to form helium-4."
