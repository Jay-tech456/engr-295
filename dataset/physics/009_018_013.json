    "message_1": "A student is trying to determine the distance between two slits in a double-slit interference experiment. They shine a red laser with a wavelength of 650 nm onto the slits and measure the distance between the bright fringes on a screen 2.0 meters away. The distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe is 3.0 cm. Calculate the distance between the two slits.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the two slits, we can use the double-slit interference formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle θ. We can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe (3.0 cm) and L is the distance between the slits and the screen (2.0 meters). Converting y to meters:\n\ny = 3.0 cm * (1 meter / 100 cm) = 0.03 meters\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ 0.03 / 2.0\nθ ≈ arctan(0.03 / 2.0)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 0.015 radians\n\nNow, we can use the double-slit interference formula to find the distance between the slits:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\nsin(0.015) = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / d\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / sin(0.015)\nd ≈ 4.33 * 10^(-5) meters\n\nConverting to micrometers:\n\nd ≈ 4.33 * 10^(-5) * (10^6 μm / 1 meter) = 43.3 μm\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits is approximately 43.3 μm."
