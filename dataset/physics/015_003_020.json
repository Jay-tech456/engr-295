    "message_2": "The polarization angle of the gravitational waves detected by LIGO during the binary black hole merger event observed on September 14, 2015 (known as GW150914) is not directly reported in the published results. However, the LIGO team did provide information about the source's sky location, distance, and the masses of the merging black holes.\n\nGravitational waves have two polarization states, called \"plus\" and \"cross\" polarizations, which are related to the relative orientation of the black hole binary. The polarization angle (Ïˆ) is the angle between the \"plus\" polarization and a fixed reference direction, usually taken to be the line of sight to the source.\n\nThe polarization angle can be inferred from the relative amplitudes and phases of the signals detected at the two LIGO detectors (Hanford and Livingston). However, due to the limited number of detectors and the degeneracy between the source's sky location and polarization angle, it is challenging to accurately determine the polarization angle for a single event like GW150914.\n\nIn general, the polarization angle provides information about the orientation of the binary's orbital plane with respect to the line of sight. A more detailed analysis of the detected gravitational wave signal, combined with additional observations from future detectors, will be required to better constrain the polarization angle and the relative orientation of the black hole binary for events like GW150914."
