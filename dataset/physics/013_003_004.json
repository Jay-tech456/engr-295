    "message_2": "The maximum energy achievable by cosmic rays in the Milky Way galaxy is typically around 10^15 electron volts (eV), or 1 PeV (Peta-electron volt). This limit is known as the \"knee\" in the cosmic ray energy spectrum, where the number of cosmic rays at higher energies drops significantly. Cosmic rays with energies above this limit are considered ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and are believed to originate from extragalactic sources.\n\nThe energy of cosmic rays depends on the acceleration mechanism involved. There are two primary mechanisms for cosmic ray acceleration in the Milky Way:\n\n1. First-order Fermi acceleration (also known as diffusive shock acceleration): This mechanism occurs in the shock waves produced by supernova explosions. When charged particles (like protons) encounter these shock waves, they can be accelerated by scattering off magnetic irregularities in the interstellar medium. The particles gain energy each time they cross the shock front, resulting in an exponential increase in their energy. This process can accelerate cosmic rays up to the \"knee\" energy of around 1 PeV.\n\n2. Second-order Fermi acceleration: This mechanism involves the interaction of charged particles with randomly moving magnetic fields in the interstellar medium. The particles gain energy through multiple small energy transfers as they scatter off the magnetic field irregularities. This process is less efficient than first-order Fermi acceleration and typically results in lower-energy cosmic rays.\n\nThe maximum energy achievable by cosmic rays in the Milky Way is determined by a balance between the acceleration processes and energy losses due to interactions with the interstellar medium, such as synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and pion production. The exact energy limit depends on the specific conditions in the acceleration region and the properties of the interstellar medium."
