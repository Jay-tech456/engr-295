    "message_1": "A rectangular plate is submerged in water with its longest dimension oriented vertically. Its width is 0.5 meters and its height is 1 meter. If the plate starts to vibrate with an amplitude of 5 mm, what is the frequency of the first resonant mode of vibration? The density of water is 1000 kg/m³ and the Young's modulus of the plate material is 2.5 x 10¹¹ Pa with a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Assume the plate is a thin rectangular plate.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the first resonant mode of vibration, we need to find the natural frequency of the plate. For a thin rectangular plate submerged in water, we can use the following formula for the natural frequency:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(D / (ρ * h^4))\n\nwhere:\nf = natural frequency (Hz)\nD = flexural rigidity of the plate\nρ = density of water (1000 kg/m³)\nh = thickness of the plate\n\nFirst, we need to find the flexural rigidity (D) of the plate. The formula for flexural rigidity is:\n\nD = (E * h^3) / (12 * (1 - ν^2))\n\nwhere:\nE = Young's modulus of the plate material (2.5 x 10¹¹ Pa)\nν = Poisson's ratio of the plate material (0.3)\n\nHowever, we don't have the thickness of the plate (h) given in the problem. Since we cannot proceed without the thickness, we can only express the natural frequency in terms of the thickness (h):\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √((E * h^3) / (12 * (1 - ν^2) * ρ * h^4))\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √((2.5 x 10¹¹ * h^3) / (12 * (1 - 0.3^2) * 1000 * h^4))\n\nWithout the thickness (h) of the plate, we cannot calculate the exact frequency of the first resonant mode of vibration."
