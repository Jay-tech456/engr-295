    "message_2": "The relationship between the size of an ion and its ability to pass through an ion channel is based on the selectivity of the channel. Ion channels are specialized proteins embedded in the cell membrane that allow specific ions to pass through based on their size, charge, and other properties. In the case of voltage-gated sodium ion channels in nerve cells, these channels are highly selective for sodium ions (Na+).\n\nThe voltage-gated sodium ion channel has a narrow pore that allows only small, positively charged ions to pass through. The size and charge of the sodium ion make it suitable for passing through this channel. Other ions, such as potassium (K+) and calcium (Ca2+), are either too large or have different charges, preventing them from passing through the sodium ion channel.\n\nDuring a nerve impulse, the voltage-gated sodium ion channels open in response to a change in the membrane potential. This allows sodium ions to flow into the cell, causing a rapid depolarization of the membrane. This depolarization leads to the propagation of the nerve impulse along the nerve cell. After the sodium ions have entered the cell, the channel closes, and the membrane potential returns to its resting state through the action of other ion channels and pumps, such as the potassium ion channels and the sodium-potassium pump.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the size of an ion and its ability to pass through an ion channel, specifically the voltage-gated sodium ion channel in nerve cells, is based on the selectivity of the channel for specific ions. This selectivity allows for the passage of sodium ions during nerve impulses, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system."
