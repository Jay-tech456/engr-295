    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outer space, primarily composed of protons, electrons, and atomic nuclei. When these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere, they can produce secondary particles, such as neutrons, muons, and other subatomic particles. These secondary particles can penetrate living organisms and cause damage to their DNA.\n\nThe impact of cosmic rays on DNA damage can be significant, especially for organisms living in environments with high exposure to cosmic rays, such as astronauts in space or organisms living at high altitudes. DNA damage caused by cosmic rays can lead to mutations, which can have various effects on the organisms, ranging from harmful to beneficial.\n\nIn terms of evolution, cosmic rays can contribute to genetic diversity by inducing mutations in the DNA of living organisms. These mutations can lead to new traits and characteristics, which may be advantageous or disadvantageous for the organism's survival and reproduction. Over time, natural selection will favor the organisms with beneficial mutations, leading to the evolution of new species and adaptations.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the contribution of cosmic rays to the overall rate of mutation and evolution is relatively small compared to other sources of DNA damage, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, chemical mutagens, and errors during DNA replication. Additionally, living organisms have evolved various mechanisms to repair DNA damage, which can minimize the impact of cosmic rays on their genetic material.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays can cause DNA damage and contribute to genetic mutations, which can affect the evolution of life in the universe. However, their impact is relatively small compared to other sources of DNA damage, and living organisms have evolved mechanisms to repair and cope with this damage."
