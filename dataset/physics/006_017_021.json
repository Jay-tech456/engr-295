    "message_2": "Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) is a spectroscopic technique used to study materials with unpaired electrons, such as free radicals and transition metal ions. The basic principle of ESR involves the interaction between an external magnetic field and the magnetic moment associated with the electron spin of the unpaired electrons in the atoms.\n\nThe electron spin resonance frequency is affected by the external magnetic field as follows:\n\n1. Zeeman Effect: When an external magnetic field is applied, it causes the energy levels of the electron spins to split into two or more sublevels. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect. The splitting of the energy levels is proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field.\n\n2. Resonance Condition: The ESR frequency is determined by the resonance condition, which states that the energy difference between the split energy levels must be equal to the energy of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed or emitted during the transition between these levels. This energy is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = hν = gμB * B0\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, h is the Planck's constant, ν is the ESR frequency, g is the g-factor (a dimensionless constant specific to the electron or system being studied), μB is the Bohr magneton (a fundamental constant of magnetic moment), and B0 is the external magnetic field strength.\n\nFrom the resonance condition formula, it is evident that the ESR frequency (ν) is directly proportional to the external magnetic field strength (B0). As the external magnetic field increases, the energy difference between the split energy levels increases, and so does the ESR frequency.\n\nIn summary, an external magnetic field affects the electron spin resonance frequency in atoms by causing the energy levels of the electron spins to split (Zeeman effect) and by altering the ESR frequency through the resonance condition. The ESR frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field."
