    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length L with fixed boundary conditions. The potential energy inside the box is zero, and it is infinite outside the box. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nψ(0) = 0\nψ(L) = 0\n\nTo solve the differential equation, we can propose a solution of the form:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since ψ(0) = 0)\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0 (since ψ(L) = 0)\n\nThe second boundary condition implies that either A = 0 or sin(kL) = 0. Since A = 0 would lead to a trivial solution (ψ(x) = 0), we consider the case sin(kL) = 0. This occurs when kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, k = nπ/L.\n\nNow, we can write the wave function as:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n sin(nπx/L)\n\nTo find the normalization constant A_n, we use the normalization condition:\n\n∫|ψ_n(x)|² dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\n∫(A_n sin(nπx/L))² dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nA_n² ∫sin²(nπx/L) dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nA_n² (L/2) = 1 (after integrating and applying the limits)\n\nA_n = √(2/L)\n\nSo, the normalized wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = √(2/L) sin(nπx/L)\n\nNow, we can find the energy eigenvalues. We substitute the wave function back into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nTaking the second derivative of ψ_n(x) with respect to x:\n\nd²ψ_n(x)/dx² = -(nπ/L)²ψ_n(x)\n\nSubstituting this back into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(-(nπ/L)²ψ_n(x)) = Eψ_n(x)\n\nSimplifying, we get the energy eigenvalues:\n\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nFor the first three energy eigenvalues (n = 1, 2, 3), we have:\n\nE_1 = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\nE_2 = (4π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\nE_3 = (9π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nAnd the corresponding wave functions are:\n\nψ_1(x) = √(2/L) sin(πx/L)\nψ_2(x) = √(2/L) sin(2πx/L)\nψ_3(x) = √(2/L) sin(3πx/L)"
