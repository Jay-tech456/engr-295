Assuming the protostar is composed of hydrogen and helium, calculate the protostar's internal temperature, pressure, and luminosity during the contracting phase until it reaches the main sequence.",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical mass of a protostar, we can use the Jeans mass, which is the minimum mass required for a gas cloud to collapse under its own gravity. The Jeans mass (M_J) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nM_J = (5 * k * T * R) / (G * μ * m_H)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^(-23) J/K), T is the temperature of the gas cloud, R is the radius of the gas cloud, G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2), μ is the mean molecular weight (for a hydrogen and helium mixture, μ ≈ 2.3), and m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 × 10^(-27) kg).\n\nTo calculate the protostar's internal temperature, pressure, and luminosity during the contracting phase, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. Virial theorem: 2 * K + U = 0, where K is the kinetic energy and U is the gravitational potential energy.\n\n2. Ideal gas law: P * V = N * k * T, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, N is the number of particles, and T is the temperature.\n\n3. Luminosity: L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4, where L is the luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10^(-8) W/m^2/K^4), and T is the temperature.\n\nDuring the contracting phase, the protostar's temperature and pressure increase as the gas cloud collapses. The luminosity also increases as the protostar gets hotter. The protostar will continue to contract until it reaches the main sequence, at which point nuclear fusion begins, and the protostar becomes a stable, main-sequence star.\n\nTo calculate the specific values for temperature, pressure, and luminosity, we would need more information about the mass and radius of the gas cloud, as well as the initial temperature."
