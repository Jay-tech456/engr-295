    "message_2": "The Hawking radiation spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions is a thermal spectrum, which means it follows the Planck distribution. The spectrum is characterized by a temperature known as the Hawking temperature, which is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. \n\nThe Hawking temperature (T_H) can be expressed as:\n\nT_H = (ħ * c^3) / (8 * π * G * M * k_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe Hawking radiation spectrum is given by the Planck distribution:\n\nP(ν, T_H) = (8 * π * ν^2 * h) / (c^3 * (e^(h * ν / (k_B * T_H)) - 1))\n\nwhere P(ν, T_H) is the power radiated per unit frequency, ν is the frequency of the radiation, and h is the Planck constant.\n\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, the Hawking temperature decreases, which means the black hole emits less radiation. Consequently, the peak of the radiation spectrum shifts to lower frequencies, and the total power emitted by the black hole decreases. In other words, more massive black holes emit less Hawking radiation and at lower frequencies compared to less massive black holes."
