    "message_2": "To find the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom when an electron is in its first excited state, we can use the formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and the definition of the Bohr radius.\n\nThe energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nGiven that the energy of the electron is -3.4 eV, we can find the principal quantum number n:\n\n-3.4 eV = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn^2 = 13.6 eV / 3.4 eV = 4\n\nn = 2\n\nSo, the electron is in the second energy level (first excited state).\n\nNow, we can find the Bohr radius for this energy level. The Bohr radius for the ground state (n = 1) is given by:\n\na₀ = 0.529 Å\n\nThe Bohr radius for any energy level n is given by:\n\na_n = a₀ * n^2\n\nwhere a_n is the Bohr radius for the nth energy level.\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 2), we have:\n\na_2 = a₀ * 2^2 = 0.529 Å * 4 = 2.116 Å\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom when an electron is in its first excited state is approximately 2.116 Å."
