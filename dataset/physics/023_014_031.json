    "message_2": "The maximum number of qubits that can be encoded using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computing techniques is not a fixed number, as it depends on the specific system and experimental setup. However, the current state-of-the-art NMR quantum computers have been able to work with around 10 to 15 qubits.\n\nThere are several factors that limit the current state-of-the-art NMR systems:\n\n1. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): As the number of qubits increases, the signal strength decreases exponentially, making it harder to distinguish the signal from the noise. This is due to the fact that the NMR signal is proportional to the difference in population between the energy levels, which decreases as the number of qubits increases.\n\n2. Decoherence: Quantum systems are highly susceptible to decoherence, which is the loss of quantum information due to interaction with the environment. In NMR systems, decoherence arises from various sources, such as spin-spin relaxation, spin-lattice relaxation, and inhomogeneities in the magnetic field. As the number of qubits increases, the system becomes more susceptible to decoherence, which limits the size of the quantum computer.\n\n3. Scalability: NMR quantum computing relies on the use of different nuclear spins as qubits. As the number of qubits increases, the complexity of the system also increases, making it difficult to control and manipulate the qubits. Additionally, the number of required radiofrequency pulses and the complexity of the pulse sequences increase with the number of qubits, making it challenging to implement large-scale NMR quantum computers.\n\n4. Spectral resolution: As the number of qubits increases, the spectral resolution of the NMR system becomes a limiting factor. The individual resonances of the qubits must be well-resolved to perform quantum operations accurately. However, as the number of qubits increases, the spectral lines become more crowded, making it difficult to resolve individual resonances.\n\nIn summary, the maximum number of qubits that can be encoded using NMR quantum computing techniques is limited by factors such as signal-to-noise ratio, decoherence, scalability, and spectral resolution. Current state-of-the-art NMR quantum computers have been able to work with around 10 to 15 qubits, but further advancements in technology and techniques are required to overcome these limitations and increase the number of qubits."
