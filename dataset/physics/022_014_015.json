    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. The range of masses for primordial black holes that could make up all of the dark matter in the universe is still a subject of ongoing research and debate among physicists.\n\nHowever, some studies have suggested that the mass range for PBHs to account for all dark matter should be within the \"sub-lunar\" mass range, which is roughly between 10^(-8) and 10^(-2) solar masses (where one solar mass is the mass of our Sun). This range is derived from various observational constraints, such as the effects of PBHs on the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of large-scale structures in the universe, and the absence of observed gravitational lensing events that would be expected if PBHs were more massive.\n\nIt is important to note that this mass range is not definitive, and other mass ranges have been proposed as well. Additionally, it is still an open question whether primordial black holes actually exist and whether they could account for all of the dark matter in the universe. Alternative dark matter candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, are also being explored by the scientific community."
