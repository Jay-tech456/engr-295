    "message_1": "A rectangular loop with dimensions 0.2 m x 0.1 m and carrying a current of 2 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force experienced by the loop if the current flows in the clockwise direction when viewed from the top?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic force experienced by the rectangular loop, we need to consider the force acting on each side of the loop. The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = I * L * B * sin(θ)\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, I is the current, L is the length of the wire, B is the magnetic field, and θ is the angle between the current direction and the magnetic field direction.\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform, we can assume it is either perpendicular or parallel to the plane of the loop. Let's assume it is perpendicular to the plane of the loop for simplicity.\n\nWhen the current flows in the clockwise direction, the magnetic force on the top and bottom sides of the loop will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so they will cancel each other out. The same applies to the left and right sides of the loop. Therefore, we only need to calculate the force on one side of the loop and multiply it by 2 to get the total force.\n\nLet's calculate the force on the top side of the loop (0.2 m long) using the formula:\n\nF_top = I * L * B * sin(θ)\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current direction, θ = 90°, and sin(90°) = 1.\n\nF_top = 2 A * 0.2 m * 0.5 T * 1\nF_top = 0.2 N\n\nNow, let's calculate the force on the left side of the loop (0.1 m long):\n\nF_left = I * L * B * sin(θ)\n\nAgain, θ = 90°, and sin(90°) = 1.\n\nF_left = 2 A * 0.1 m * 0.5 T * 1\nF_left = 0.1 N\n\nSince the forces on the top and bottom sides are equal and opposite, as well as the forces on the left and right sides, the total magnetic force experienced by the loop is:\n\nF_total = 2 * (F_top + F_left)\nF_total = 2 * (0.2 N + 0.1 N)\nF_total = 2 * 0.3 N\nF_total = 0.6 N\n\nThe direction of the magnetic force can be determined using the right-hand rule. For the top side of the loop, the force will be directed into the plane (downwards), and for the left side of the loop, the force will be directed out of the plane (upwards). Since the forces on the bottom and right sides are equal and opposite, they will cancel each other out, and the net force will be 0.6 N acting perpendicular to the plane of the loop."
