    "message_1": "A converging lens has a focal length of 20 cm, and the refractive index of the lens material is 1.5. If an object is placed 30 cm in front of the lens, what is the magnification of the image formed by the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the lens, we first need to determine the image distance (v) using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (converging lens, so f is positive)\nu = -30 cm (object is placed in front of the lens, so u is negative)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(-3 + v) / (20 * -30) = 1/v\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\nv(-3 + v) = 20 * -30\n\nv^2 - 3v = -600\n\nv^2 - 3v + 600 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for v using the quadratic formula:\n\nv = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -3, and c = 600.\n\nv = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4 * 1 * 600)) / (2 * 1)\n\nv = (3 ± √(9 - 2400)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for v. However, in the context of optics, we can ignore the negative square root and consider only the positive square root:\n\nv = (3 + √(2400 - 9)) / 2\n\nv = (3 + √2391) / 2\n\nv ≈ 48.5 cm (positive value indicates that the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens)\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -48.5 / -30\n\nM ≈ 1.62\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the lens is approximately 1.62."
