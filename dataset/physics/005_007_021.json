    "message_1": "Consider two identical twins, Alice and Bob. Alice remains on Earth while Bob travels on a spaceship traveling at a high velocity. After some time, Bob returns to Earth and it is observed that he has aged less than Alice. Calculate the difference in ages between Alice and Bob, given the velocity of the spaceship and the elapsed time on board.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the difference in ages between Alice and Bob, we can use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity. The formula is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\n- Δt' is the time elapsed for Bob in the spaceship (proper time)\n- Δt is the time elapsed for Alice on Earth (coordinate time)\n- v is the velocity of the spaceship\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the time elapsed for Bob (Δt') using the given velocity (v) and elapsed time on Earth (Δt). Then, we can find the difference in ages by subtracting the time elapsed for Bob from the time elapsed for Alice.\n\nLet's assume the velocity of the spaceship (v) and the elapsed time on Earth (Δt) are given. We can calculate the time elapsed for Bob (Δt') using the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nNow, we can find the difference in ages between Alice and Bob:\n\nAge difference = Δt - Δt'\n\nThis will give us the difference in ages between Alice and Bob after Bob returns to Earth."
