    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a toroidal coil, the magnetic field is in the circumferential direction, and its magnitude is constant along a circle with a given radius. Therefore, we can write the closed line integral as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, r is the distance from the center of the toroid, n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since there are 200 turns and the mean radius is 6 cm, the total length of the coil is:\n\nC = 2πR = 2π(6 cm) = 12π cm\n\nSo, the number of turns per unit length is:\n\nn = 200 turns / 12π cm ≈ 5.305 turns/cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the toroid. We will use the formula:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere r = 4 cm, n ≈ 5.305 turns/cm, and I = 2 A. The permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB * 2π(4 cm) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5.305 turns/cm) * (2 A)\n\nB * 8π cm = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5.305 turns/cm) * (2 A)\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = [(4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5.305 turns/cm) * (2 A)] / (8π cm)\n\nB ≈ (4.22 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A) / 8 cm\n\nB ≈ 1.055 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 1.055 × 10^(-7) T (Tesla)."
