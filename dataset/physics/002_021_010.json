    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of ethane in the gas mixture, we need to use the fugacity coefficient. The fugacity coefficient (φ) is a dimensionless quantity that accounts for the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. It is defined as the ratio of the fugacity (f) of a component in a mixture to its partial pressure (P_i).\n\nφ_i = f_i / P_i\n\nFirst, let's find the mole fraction of ethane (x_ethane) in the gas mixture:\n\nx_methane = 0.6\nx_ethane = 1 - x_methane = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nNext, we need to find the partial pressure of ethane (P_ethane):\n\nP_total = 10 bar\nP_ethane = x_ethane * P_total = 0.4 * 10 = 4 bar\n\nNow, we need to find the fugacity coefficient (φ_ethane) for ethane. This can be obtained from a fugacity coefficient chart or calculated using an equation of state, such as the Peng-Robinson equation of state. For simplicity, let's assume that the gas mixture behaves ideally, which means that the fugacity coefficient is equal to 1:\n\nφ_ethane = 1\n\nFinally, we can find the fugacity of ethane (f_ethane) using the fugacity coefficient and partial pressure:\n\nf_ethane = φ_ethane * P_ethane = 1 * 4 = 4 bar\n\nTherefore, the fugacity of ethane in the gas mixture is 4 bar. Keep in mind that this is a simplified calculation assuming ideal behavior. For a more accurate result, you would need to use a fugacity coefficient chart or an equation of state to find the fugacity coefficient for ethane at the given temperature and pressure."
