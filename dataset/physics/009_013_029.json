    "message_2": "To calculate the spherical aberration in a plano-convex lens, we need to find the difference in the focal lengths of the marginal and paraxial rays. We will use the lens maker's formula and the paraxial approximation to find the focal lengths.\n\nLens maker's formula:\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nFor a plano-convex lens, R1 = 20 cm (given) and R2 = ∞ (since the second surface is flat).\n\nNow, let's find the focal length for the paraxial rays (f_paraxial) using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f_paraxial = (1.5-1)(1/20 - 1/∞)\n1/f_paraxial = 0.5(1/20)\nf_paraxial = 40 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the focal length for the marginal rays (f_marginal). To do this, we will use the paraxial approximation:\n\nsinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ (in radians)\n\nwhere θ is the angle of incidence (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, convert the angle of incidence to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, apply the paraxial approximation to find the angle of refraction (θ') using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sinθ = n2 * sinθ'\n1 * sin(π/6) = 1.5 * sinθ'\nsinθ' = (1/1.5) * sin(π/6)\nθ' = arcsin((1/1.5) * sin(π/6))\n\nNow, we can find the radius of curvature for the marginal rays (R_marginal):\n\nR_marginal = R1 / cos(θ - θ')\n\nNow, we can find the focal length for the marginal rays (f_marginal) using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f_marginal = (1.5-1)(1/R_marginal - 1/∞)\nf_marginal = 1 / [(1.5-1)(1/R_marginal)]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the spherical aberration (SA):\n\nSA = f_marginal - f_paraxial\n\nThis will give us the spherical aberration in the plano-convex lens for the given conditions."
