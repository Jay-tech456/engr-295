    "message_2": "The Higgs Mechanism is a fundamental process in the Standard Model of particle physics that explains the origin of mass in subatomic particles. It operates through the Higgs field, an invisible energy field that permeates all of space. The Higgs field is associated with the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN.\n\nThe Higgs Mechanism works by interacting with other particles in the following way:\n\n1. The Higgs field has a non-zero value even in its lowest energy state (vacuum). This means that it is always \"on\" and has a constant value throughout the universe.\n\n2. As other particles, such as quarks and leptons, move through the Higgs field, they interact with it. The strength of this interaction depends on the type of particle and its properties.\n\n3. The interaction with the Higgs field gives particles their mass. The stronger the interaction, the more massive the particle. For example, particles like photons do not interact with the Higgs field and therefore have no mass, while particles like the W and Z bosons have a strong interaction and are quite massive.\n\n4. The Higgs boson is a manifestation of the Higgs field. When the Higgs field is excited, it can create a Higgs boson, which is a massive scalar particle. This particle can then decay into other particles, providing further evidence of the Higgs field's existence.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the Higgs Mechanism comes primarily from the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012. This discovery was made by analyzing the decay products of proton-proton collisions at high energies. The Higgs boson was found to have a mass of approximately 125 GeV/c^2, which is consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.\n\nAdditionally, the properties of the Higgs boson, such as its decay rates and production cross-sections, have been measured and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. This provides strong evidence that the Higgs Mechanism is responsible for giving mass to subatomic particles.\n\nIn summary, the Higgs Mechanism in the Standard Model accounts for the origin of mass in subatomic particles through their interaction with the Higgs field. The discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its properties provide experimental evidence supporting this theory."
