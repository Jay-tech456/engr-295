    "message_2": "To calculate the topological charge and determine if the given quantum field theory supports topological defects such as domain walls or vortices, we first need to analyze the potential term in the Lagrangian density.\n\nThe potential term is given by V(φ) = λ(φ² - v²)². This is a symmetric double-well potential with minima at φ = ±v. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field is non-zero, which means that the theory exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nNow, let's consider the topological defects that can arise in this theory:\n\n1. Domain walls: Domain walls are topological defects that can form in scalar field theories with discrete symmetry breaking. In our case, the potential has a Z2 symmetry (φ → -φ), which is spontaneously broken by the non-zero VEV. Therefore, the theory can support domain walls.\n\n2. Vortices: Vortices are topological defects that can form in scalar field theories with continuous symmetry breaking. However, in our case, the symmetry is discrete (Z2), not continuous. Therefore, the theory does not support vortices.\n\nTo calculate the topological charge, we need to find the homotopy group associated with the symmetry breaking. For a Z2 symmetry, the homotopy group is π₀, which is the set of connected components of the vacuum manifold. In our case, the vacuum manifold consists of two points (φ = ±v), so the homotopy group π₀ has two elements.\n\nThe topological charge is given by the number of distinct elements in the homotopy group. In our case, the topological charge is 2.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological charge of the given quantum field theory is 2, and the theory supports domain walls but not vortices."
