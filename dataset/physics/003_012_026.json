    "message_1": "A square loop of wire with a side length of 10 centimeters carries a current of 2 amperes. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, we can find the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The side length is 10 cm, which is equal to 0.1 m. The current is 2 A. The distance from the center of the side to the center of the loop is half the side length, which is 0.05 m.\n\nFor a straight wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * r)\n\nSo, for one side of the square loop, the magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.05 m) = (8π × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1 m\n\nB_side = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = 4 * 8 × 10^(-6) T = 32 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. For each side of the square loop, the magnetic field at the center will be pointing out of the plane (or into the plane) depending on the direction of the current. Since the loop is symmetrical, the magnetic fields due to opposite sides will have the same direction, and they will add up.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 32 × 10^(-6) T, and the direction is either out of the plane or into the plane, depending on the direction of the current."
