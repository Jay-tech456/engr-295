    "message_1": "A physics student is required to determine the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field for a hydrogen atom in its ground state using the Zeeman effect equation. The magnetic field has a strength of 0.05 T and the spectral line has a wavelength of 656.28 nm. What is the magnitude of the splitting of the spectral line, and how many distinct lines will be observed?",
    "message_2": "To determine the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field, we can use the Zeeman effect equation:\n\nΔE = m_j * e * B * h_bar / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the split levels, m_j is the magnetic quantum number (-1, 0, 1 for the ground state of hydrogen), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), B is the magnetic field strength (0.05 T), h_bar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy difference for each value of m_j:\n\nΔE(-1) = -1 * (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (0.05 T) * (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nΔE(0) = 0\nΔE(1) = 1 * (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (0.05 T) * (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\n\nNow, let's convert the energy difference to a wavelength difference using the equation:\n\nΔλ = (h * c) / (λ^2 * ΔE)\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the initial wavelength (656.28 nm).\n\nΔλ(-1) = (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / ((656.28 × 10^(-9) m)^2 * ΔE(-1))\nΔλ(0) = 0\nΔλ(1) = (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / ((656.28 × 10^(-9) m)^2 * ΔE(1))\n\nFinally, we can calculate the new wavelengths for each split level:\n\nλ(-1) = 656.28 nm - Δλ(-1)\nλ(0) = 656.28 nm\nλ(1) = 656.28 nm + Δλ(1)\n\nThe magnitude of the splitting of the spectral line is the difference between the highest and lowest wavelengths:\n\nΔλ_split = λ(1) - λ(-1)\n\nAs for the number of distinct lines observed, there will be 3 lines corresponding to the 3 magnetic quantum numbers (-1, 0, 1)."
