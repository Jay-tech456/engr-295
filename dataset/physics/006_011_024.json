    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a₀) is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom when the electron is in the ground state (n = 1). It is given by the formula:\n\na₀ = 4πε₀ħ² / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere:\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²)\nħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js)\nm_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n\na₀ = (4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) * (1.054 x 10^(-34))^2) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius in a hydrogen atom when its electron is in the ground state is approximately 5.291 x 10^(-11) meters or 52.91 picometers."
