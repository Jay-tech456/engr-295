    "message_1": "An ideal gas mixture containing 40% nitrogen, 30% oxygen, and 30% carbon dioxide by moles has a total pressure of 15 atm at 298 K. Determine the partial pressure and fugacity of each component in the mixture.",
    "message_2": "To determine the partial pressure of each component in the mixture, we can use the mole fraction and the total pressure. The mole fraction (x) of each component can be calculated as follows:\n\nx_N2 = 0.40 (40% nitrogen)\nx_O2 = 0.30 (30% oxygen)\nx_CO2 = 0.30 (30% carbon dioxide)\n\nThe total pressure (P_total) is given as 15 atm. Now, we can calculate the partial pressure (P_i) of each component using the formula:\n\nP_i = x_i * P_total\n\nFor nitrogen (N2):\nP_N2 = x_N2 * P_total = 0.40 * 15 atm = 6 atm\n\nFor oxygen (O2):\nP_O2 = x_O2 * P_total = 0.30 * 15 atm = 4.5 atm\n\nFor carbon dioxide (CO2):\nP_CO2 = x_CO2 * P_total = 0.30 * 15 atm = 4.5 atm\n\nNow, let's calculate the fugacity (f_i) of each component. For an ideal gas, the fugacity is equal to its partial pressure:\n\nf_N2 = P_N2 = 6 atm\nf_O2 = P_O2 = 4.5 atm\nf_CO2 = P_CO2 = 4.5 atm\n\nSo, the partial pressures and fugacities of the components in the mixture are:\n\nNitrogen (N2): Partial pressure = 6 atm, Fugacity = 6 atm\nOxygen (O2): Partial pressure = 4.5 atm, Fugacity = 4.5 atm\nCarbon dioxide (CO2): Partial pressure = 4.5 atm, Fugacity = 4.5 atm"
