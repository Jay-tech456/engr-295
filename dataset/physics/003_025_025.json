    "message_1": "A long wire carrying 8 A of current is wrapped around a resistor with a resistance of 10 ohms. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor? (Assume the wire wraps around the resistor uniformly and the resistance of the wire is negligible)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) around a long straight wire carrying a current (I) at a distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 8 A, and the distance r is 5 cm (0.05 m). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 8 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 8 A) / (0.05 m)\n\nB = (32 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.05 m)\n\nB = 6.4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the resistor is approximately 6.4 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
