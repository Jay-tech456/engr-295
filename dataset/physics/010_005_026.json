    "message_2": "To determine the drag force and lift force acting on the ball, we need to calculate the Reynolds number and use the drag coefficient to find the drag force. Lift force can be assumed to be negligible for a sphere in a fluid.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nDiameter (D) = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nDensity of ball (ρ_ball) = 0.8 g/cm³ = 800 kg/m³\nDensity of fluid (ρ_fluid) = 1.2 kg/m³\nDynamic viscosity (μ) = 2.5×10⁻⁵ Pa·s\nVelocity (V) = 10 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number (Re):\n\nRe = (ρ_fluid * V * D) / μ\n\nRe = (1.2 kg/m³ * 10 m/s * 0.05 m) / (2.5×10⁻⁵ Pa·s)\nRe ≈ 24000\n\nFor a sphere, the drag coefficient (C_d) can be approximated using the following equation for Reynolds numbers between 10^3 and 2×10^5:\n\nC_d ≈ 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the drag force (F_d) using the drag force equation:\n\nF_d = 0.5 * ρ_fluid * V² * C_d * A\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere:\n\nA = π * (D/2)²\nA = π * (0.05 m / 2)²\nA ≈ 0.001963 m²\n\nNow, let's calculate the drag force:\n\nF_d = 0.5 * 1.2 kg/m³ * (10 m/s)² * 0.5 * 0.001963 m²\nF_d ≈ 0.588 N\n\nFor a sphere in a fluid, the lift force is negligible. Therefore, the lift force (F_L) is approximately zero.\n\nSo, the drag force acting on the ball is approximately 0.588 N, and the lift force is negligible (approximately 0 N)."
