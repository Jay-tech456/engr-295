    "message_1": "A beam of unpolarized light is incident on a polarizer with an axis that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the vertical. What is the intensity of the transmitted light if the incident intensity is 10 mW/cm²?",
    "message_2": "When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light is given by Malus' law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and θ is the angle between the axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the light.\n\nIn this case, the incident intensity (I_incident) is 10 mW/cm² and the angle (θ) is 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_transmitted = 10 mW/cm² * cos²(π/6)\nI_transmitted = 10 mW/cm² * (cos(π/6))^2\nI_transmitted = 10 mW/cm² * (0.866)^2\nI_transmitted ≈ 10 mW/cm² * 0.75\nI_transmitted ≈ 7.5 mW/cm²\n\nSo, the intensity of the transmitted light is approximately 7.5 mW/cm²."
