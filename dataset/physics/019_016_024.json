The chiral anomaly can be understood as a non-conservation of the chiral current due to quantum effects.\n\n1. First, let's write down the massless Dirac equation in two dimensions:\n\n(iγ^μ∂_μ - eγ^μA_μ)ψ = 0\n\nHere, γ^μ are the 2D gamma matrices, A_μ is the gauge field, e is the coupling constant, and ψ is the Dirac fermion field.\n\n2. Next, we define the chiral current J^μ_5:\n\nJ^μ_5 = ψ†γ^μγ^5ψ\n\n3. Now, we need to compute the path integral measure for the fermion fields. To do this, we introduce a regularization by introducing a Pauli-Villars regulator field χ with mass M:\n\nDψDψ† = DψDψ†DχDχ† exp(-M²χ†χ)\n\n4. We then compute the change in the path integral measure under a chiral transformation:\n\nψ → exp(iαγ^5)ψ\nχ → exp(iαγ^5)χ\n\n5. Using the Fujikawa method, we compute the change in the path integral measure by calculating the Jacobian of the transformation. This involves computing the trace of the chiral transformation on the fermion fields:\n\nΔ(α) = Tr[γ^5 exp(iαγ^5)]\n\n6. The trace is computed in the limit M → ∞, and we find that:\n\nΔ(α) = -2iαe²/4πε\n\nHere, ε is the regularization parameter.\n\n7. Finally, we obtain the chiral anomaly by taking the derivative of Δ(α) with respect to α:\n\n∂_μJ^μ_5 = -e²/4πε F\n\nwhere F is the field strength tensor for the gauge field A_μ.\n\nIn conclusion, the chiral anomaly for a massless Dirac fermion in two-dimensional spacetime with a chiral coupling to a gauge field is given by:\n\n∂_μJ^μ_5 = -e²/4πε F"
