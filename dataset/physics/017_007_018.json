    "message_2": "In a three-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological insulator (3D TI), the topological invariants are characterized by the Z2 invariants, which are derived from the electronic band structure of the material. These invariants determine the topological properties of the insulator and are responsible for the unique surface states observed in these materials.\n\nThe Z2 invariants are calculated based on the parity of the occupied electronic states at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) points in the Brillouin zone. In a 3D TI, there are four TRIM points, and thus, there are four Z2 invariants: (ν₀; ν₁, ν₂, ν₃). The first Z2 invariant, ν₀, is called the strong invariant, while the other three, ν₁, ν₂, and ν₃, are called weak invariants.\n\nThe strong invariant, ν₀, is the most crucial in determining the topological properties of the 3D TI. If ν₀ = 1, the material is a nontrivial topological insulator, while if ν₀ = 0, the material is a trivial insulator. The weak invariants, on the other hand, do not affect the existence of surface states but can influence their properties, such as their dispersion and connectivity.\n\nThe surface states in a 3D TI are characterized by the presence of gapless, spin-polarized, and linearly dispersing Dirac cones. These surface states are topologically protected, meaning that they are robust against perturbations and disorder, as long as time-reversal symmetry is preserved. The existence of these surface states is directly related to the nontrivial Z2 invariants of the bulk material.\n\nIn summary, the topological invariants in a 3D time-reversal-invariant topological insulator are the Z2 invariants, which are calculated based on the parity of the occupied electronic states at the TRIM points. The strong invariant, ν₀, determines the topological nature of the insulator, while the weak invariants can influence the properties of the surface states. The surface states in a 3D TI are characterized by gapless, spin-polarized Dirac cones that are topologically protected due to the nontrivial Z2 invariants of the bulk material."
