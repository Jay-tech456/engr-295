    "message_2": "Advancements in technology have played a crucial role in the detection and observation of black holes beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Several cutting-edge instruments and techniques have been developed and refined over the years, enabling scientists to gather more accurate and detailed data about these mysterious cosmic phenomena. Some of the key technological advancements include:\n\n1. Radio telescopes: Radio telescopes are essential tools for observing black holes, as they can detect radio waves emitted by the material surrounding these objects. The development of large, sensitive radio telescope arrays, such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), has significantly improved our ability to detect and study black holes in distant galaxies.\n\n2. X-ray observatories: Black holes emit X-rays when they consume matter from their surroundings. Advanced space-based X-ray observatories, such as NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton, have allowed astronomers to detect and study black holes by capturing high-resolution X-ray images and spectra of these objects.\n\n3. Gravitational wave detectors: The groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo observatories has opened up a new way to study black holes. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as merging black holes. By analyzing the gravitational wave signals, scientists can infer the properties of the black holes involved in the merger, even if they are located in distant galaxies.\n\n4. Optical and infrared telescopes: Advanced optical and infrared telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, have provided valuable information about the environments surrounding black holes. These telescopes can observe the effects of black holes on nearby stars and gas, helping to confirm the presence of black holes and providing insights into their properties.\n\n5. Computational power and simulations: The growth of computational power and the development of sophisticated numerical simulations have allowed scientists to model the complex processes occurring near black holes. These simulations help researchers understand the behavior of matter and energy in the vicinity of black holes, as well as the formation and evolution of these objects.\n\n6. Multi-messenger astronomy: The combination of different observational techniques, such as radio, optical, X-ray, and gravitational wave astronomy, has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of black holes. By studying black holes using multiple methods, scientists can obtain a more complete picture of their properties and behavior.\n\nIn summary, advancements in technology have significantly improved our ability to detect and study black holes beyond the Milky Way galaxy. The development of sensitive instruments, such as radio telescopes, X-ray observatories, and gravitational wave detectors, along with the growth of computational power and multi-messenger astronomy, has allowed scientists to gather more accurate and detailed data about these enigmatic cosmic objects."
