    "message_2": "The estimated rate of gravitational wave detections for future observatories depends on the specific observatory and its sensitivity. Here, we will consider two upcoming observatories: the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).\n\n1. Einstein Telescope (ET): The ET is a proposed third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector that aims to be 10 times more sensitive than current detectors like LIGO and Virgo. With its increased sensitivity, the ET is expected to detect gravitational wave events at a much higher rate. According to some estimates, the ET could detect up to several thousand binary neutron star mergers per year, compared to the current rate of a few per year for LIGO and Virgo.\n\n2. Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA): LISA is a planned space-based gravitational wave observatory that will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves than ground-based detectors. LISA is expected to detect gravitational waves from sources such as supermassive black hole mergers and compact binary systems in our galaxy. Estimates for LISA's detection rate vary depending on the source type, but it is expected to detect several tens of supermassive black hole mergers per year and thousands of compact binary systems over its mission lifetime.\n\nThese estimates are based on current theoretical models of gravitational wave sources, detector sensitivity, and expected observation time. However, it is important to note that these numbers may change as our understanding of gravitational wave sources and detector technology evolves."
