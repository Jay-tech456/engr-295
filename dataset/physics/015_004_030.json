    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the formula for the energy radiated in gravitational waves by an asymmetric system:\n\nE = (G/c^5) * (dE/dt) * t\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), dE/dt is the rate of energy emission, and t is the duration of the gravitational wave emission.\n\nFor a supernova explosion, the rate of energy emission (dE/dt) can be approximated as:\n\ndE/dt = k * M^2 * R^4 * ω^6\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality, M is the mass of the supernova, R is the distance from the center of mass, and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\nGiven the mass of the supernova is 15 times that of the sun (M = 15 * M_sun = 15 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg), and the duration of the gravitational wave emission is 2 seconds (t = 2 s), we can estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves.\n\nHowever, we need more information to calculate the rate of energy emission (dE/dt), such as the distance from the center of mass (R) and the angular frequency of the oscillation (ω). Additionally, the constant of proportionality (k) is not provided.\n\nWith the given information, we cannot accurately estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by the supernova explosion."
