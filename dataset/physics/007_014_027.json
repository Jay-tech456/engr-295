    "message_2": "To calculate the radius of a nucleus, we can use the empirical formula known as the Fermi's approximation, which relates the radius (R) of a nucleus to its atomic mass number (A):\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nHere, R₀ is a constant with a value of approximately 1.2 fm (femtometers, where 1 fm = 10^(-15) meters).\n\nGiven the atomic mass number A = 50, we can calculate the radius of the nucleus:\n\nR = 1.2 fm * (50)^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.2 fm * 3.684\nR ≈ 4.421 fm\n\nSo, the radius of the nucleus with an atomic mass number of 50 and charge of 20 is approximately 4.421 femtometers."
