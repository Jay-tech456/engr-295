    "message_2": "Quantum gravity is an attempt to unify the two major theories in physics: general relativity, which describes gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe, and quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles and forces at the smallest scales. Currently, there is no complete and universally accepted theory of quantum gravity, but there are several approaches being studied, such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, and others.\n\nIn the context of black holes, general relativity predicts the existence of an event horizon, which is a boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, not even light. However, general relativity does not provide a complete description of the behavior of matter and energy inside the event horizon, as it does not account for quantum effects.\n\nHawking radiation is a phenomenon that arises when we consider quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole. In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that, due to quantum fluctuations, particle-antiparticle pairs can be created near the event horizon. One of the particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, making it appear as if the black hole is emitting radiation. This process leads to the gradual loss of mass and the eventual evaporation of the black hole.\n\nA complete theory of quantum gravity would provide a more detailed understanding of the behavior of black holes beyond the event horizon, including the nature of the singularity at the center and the ultimate fate of the information that falls into the black hole. Some approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity, suggest that the singularity at the center of a black hole might be replaced by a bounce, leading to a new region of spacetime. In string theory, black holes are described as complex, higher-dimensional objects called \"fuzzballs,\" which have no event horizon or singularity.\n\nIn any case, a successful theory of quantum gravity would need to account for the phenomenon of Hawking radiation and the evaporation of black holes, as well as provide a consistent description of the behavior of matter and energy inside the event horizon. This remains an open and active area of research in theoretical physics."
