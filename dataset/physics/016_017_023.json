    "message_2": "The energy stored in a superconducting coil can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEnergy (E) = (1/2) * L * I^2\n\nwhere L is the inductance (in henries) and I is the current (in amperes).\n\nGiven the inductance L = 10 H and the current I = 20 A, we can calculate the maximum energy stored in the coil:\n\nE = (1/2) * 10 H * (20 A)^2\nE = 0.5 * 10 H * 400 A^2\nE = 5 * 400 J\nE = 2000 J\n\nThe maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the superconducting coil is 2000 Joules."
