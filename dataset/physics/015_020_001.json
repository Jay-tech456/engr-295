    "message_2": "To estimate the expected rate at which a ground-based laser interferometer detector like LIGO will detect gravitational waves from a population of binary white dwarfs in the Milky Way galaxy, we need to consider several factors, including the number of binary white dwarfs in the galaxy, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by these systems, and the sensitivity of LIGO to these signals.\n\n1. Number of binary white dwarfs in the Milky Way: There are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and around 97% of them will end their lives as white dwarfs. However, not all white dwarfs are in binary systems. Estimates suggest that around 10% of white dwarfs are in binary systems, which gives us approximately 10 billion white dwarfs and 1 billion binary white dwarf systems.\n\n2. Gravitational wave frequency: Binary white dwarfs emit gravitational waves at frequencies that are typically in the millihertz (mHz) range. This is due to their relatively small masses and large separations compared to more compact binary systems like binary neutron stars or black holes.\n\n3. LIGO sensitivity: LIGO is designed to detect gravitational waves in the frequency range of 10 Hz to several kHz. This means that LIGO is not sensitive to the mHz frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by binary white dwarfs. Instead, future space-based detectors like LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) are being developed to detect gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range, which will be more suitable for detecting signals from binary white dwarfs.\n\nConsidering these factors, the expected rate at which LIGO will detect gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs in the Milky Way galaxy is effectively zero, as LIGO is not sensitive to the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by these systems. However, future space-based detectors like LISA will be able to detect these signals and provide valuable information about the population of binary white dwarfs in our galaxy."
