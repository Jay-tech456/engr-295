    "message_2": "Cosmic radiation background refers to the ionizing radiation that originates from outer space and penetrates Earth's atmosphere. In space, humans are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation than on Earth due to the lack of a protective atmosphere. The dose of cosmic radiation a human would receive in space depends on various factors such as altitude, solar activity, and shielding provided by the spacecraft.\n\nOn average, an astronaut residing in space for one year would receive a dose of about 200-300 millisieverts (mSv) of cosmic radiation. This value is based on measurements from the International Space Station (ISS) and other space missions. For comparison, the average annual dose of ionizing radiation on Earth is about 3 mSv, which includes natural background radiation and medical exposures.\n\nThe potential health effects of exposure to cosmic radiation in space are a significant concern for long-duration space missions. The primary risks associated with cosmic radiation exposure include:\n\n1. Increased cancer risk: Ionizing radiation can damage DNA, which may lead to the development of cancer. The lifetime risk of cancer increases with the cumulative dose of radiation received. A dose of 200-300 mSv per year would significantly increase an astronaut's risk of developing cancer over their lifetime.\n\n2. Acute radiation sickness: At extremely high doses (above 1000 mSv), ionizing radiation can cause acute radiation sickness, which includes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and skin burns. However, the expected dose of cosmic radiation for an astronaut in space for one year is not high enough to cause acute radiation sickness.\n\n3. Central nervous system effects: High-energy particles in cosmic radiation can cause damage to the central nervous system, potentially leading to cognitive impairments, memory loss, and other neurological disorders. The long-term effects of cosmic radiation on the central nervous system are still not well understood and are an area of ongoing research.\n\n4. Cataracts: Exposure to ionizing radiation can increase the risk of developing cataracts, which is a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision.\n\n5. Hereditary effects: Although the risk is considered to be low, there is a possibility that radiation-induced genetic damage could lead to hereditary effects in the offspring of exposed individuals.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, spacecraft are designed with shielding materials to reduce radiation exposure, and mission durations are planned to limit the cumulative dose received by astronauts. Additionally, ongoing research aims to develop more effective shielding technologies and better understand the biological effects of cosmic radiation exposure."
