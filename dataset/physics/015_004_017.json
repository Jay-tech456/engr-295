    "message_2": "To calculate the energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we need to know the total energy emitted and the fraction of that energy converted into gravitational waves. \n\nTypically, a supernova releases about 10^44 joules (1 foe) of energy in the form of light, neutrinos, and kinetic energy. However, only a small fraction of this energy is emitted as gravitational waves. The exact fraction depends on the specific details of the supernova explosion, such as the mass and rotation of the progenitor star, and the explosion mechanism. For a typical core-collapse supernova, the fraction of energy emitted as gravitational waves is estimated to be around 10^(-4) to 10^(-9) of the total energy.\n\nLet's take the upper limit of this range, 10^(-4), as an example. In this case, the energy emitted in gravitational waves would be:\n\nE_grav = 10^44 J * 10^(-4) = 10^40 J\n\nIt's important to note that the distance of the supernova from the observer (10 megaparsecs) does not affect the total energy emitted in gravitational waves. However, it does affect the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal that the observer would detect. The amplitude decreases as 1/distance, so the signal would be weaker for more distant supernovae."
