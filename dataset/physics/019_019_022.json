    "message_2": "In a two-dimensional free boson conformal field theory (CFT), the action is given by the free massless scalar field action:\n\nS = (1/4π) ∫ d^2z (∂φ)(∂̄φ),\n\nwhere φ is the scalar field, and ∂ and ∂̄ are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic derivatives, respectively.\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor T(z) and its antiholomorphic counterpart T̄(z̄) can be computed from the action. For the free boson CFT, they are given by:\n\nT(z) = -(1/2) (∂φ)^2,\nT̄(z̄) = -(1/2) (∂̄φ)^2.\n\nThe primary operators in the free boson CFT are the vertex operators V_α(z) = :e^(iαφ(z)):, where α is a real parameter, and :...: denotes normal ordering. The conformal dimension (h, h̄) of a primary operator is given by the eigenvalues of the action of the Virasoro generators L_0 and L̄_0 on the operator:\n\nL_0 V_α(z) = h V_α(z),\nL̄_0 V_α(z) = h̄ V_α(z).\n\nFor the vertex operators, the conformal dimensions can be computed using the OPE (operator product expansion) of the energy-momentum tensor with the vertex operator:\n\nT(z) V_α(w) ~ (h/(z-w)^2) V_α(w) + (∂V_α(w))/(z-w).\n\nUsing the OPE of T(z) with the vertex operator and the definition of T(z) in terms of the free boson field φ, we find that the conformal dimensions (h, h̄) of the vertex operators V_α(z) are given by:\n\nh = h̄ = (α^2)/2.\n\nThe lowest dimension primary operator corresponds to the smallest non-zero value of α. In the free boson CFT, the spectrum is continuous, so there is no smallest non-zero value of α. However, we can consider the limit as α approaches zero. In this limit, the conformal dimensions (h, h̄) of the lowest dimension primary operator approach zero:\n\nh = h̄ = 0.\n\nThus, the conformal dimension of the lowest dimension primary operator in the two-dimensional free boson conformal field theory is (0, 0)."
