    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I * A) / (2 * π * R³)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, A is the area of the loop, and R is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN = 50 turns\nI = 2 A\nA = 10 cm × 10 cm = 0.1 m × 0.1 m = 0.01 m²\n\nSince we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, the distance R is half the diagonal of the square loop. We can find the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal = √(Side₁² + Side₂²) = √(0.1² + 0.1²) = √(0.01 + 0.01) = √0.02\n\nSo, R = Diagonal / 2 = √0.02 / 2 ≈ 0.070710678 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 50 * 2 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * π * (0.070710678 m)³)\nB ≈ (4π × 10⁻⁷ * 50 * 2 * 0.01) / (2 * π * 0.000353453)\n\nB ≈ (4 * 50 * 2 * 0.01) / (0.000353453)\nB ≈ 1.13137085 T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.131 T."
