    "message_2": "Calculating non-perturbative effects in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on the properties of hadrons, such as their mass and spin, is a challenging task due to the strong coupling nature of the QCD at low energies. However, there are a few methods that have been developed to tackle this problem:\n\n1. Lattice QCD: Lattice QCD is a non-perturbative, numerical approach to solving QCD by discretizing spacetime into a lattice of points. By simulating the QCD on a lattice, one can compute the properties of hadrons, such as their mass and spin, by solving the equations of motion for quarks and gluons on the lattice. This method has been successful in calculating various hadron properties, but it requires significant computational resources and can be limited by the finite size of the lattice.\n\n2. Effective Field Theories: Effective field theories (EFTs) are a way to describe the low-energy behavior of a system by integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom. In the context of QCD, EFTs like Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) have been developed to describe the properties of hadrons containing light and heavy quarks, respectively. These EFTs can be used to calculate non-perturbative effects in QCD by matching the EFT to the full QCD at a certain energy scale and then using the EFT to compute hadron properties at lower energies.\n\n3. QCD Sum Rules: QCD sum rules are a method to relate the properties of hadrons to the vacuum expectation values of certain QCD operators. By using the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and dispersion relations, one can derive sum rules that relate hadron properties to non-perturbative QCD effects. These sum rules can then be used to extract information about hadron masses, decay constants, and other properties.\n\n4. AdS/CFT Correspondence: The AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between a strongly coupled gauge theory (like QCD) and a weakly coupled gravity theory in a higher-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. This duality allows one to study non-perturbative QCD effects by solving the corresponding gravity problem in the AdS space. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence has not been proven for QCD, it has been applied to study various aspects of hadron physics, such as the mass spectrum and the quark-gluon plasma.\n\nThese methods, along with others, have been used to study non-perturbative effects in QCD and their impact on hadron properties. However, it is important to note that each method has its limitations and uncertainties, and a combination of these approaches is often necessary to obtain reliable results."
