    "message_2": "At the end of the cosmic inflation period, which occurred around 10^-32 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe was approximately 10^27 Kelvin (or 10^27 degrees Celsius). This extremely high temperature played a crucial role in the subsequent development of the universe.\n\nThe high temperature at the end of the inflation period allowed for the formation of elementary particles, such as quarks, electrons, and neutrinos. As the universe continued to expand and cool, these particles combined to form protons and neutrons, which later combined to form atomic nuclei during the nucleosynthesis era.\n\nThe temperature continued to drop, and around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms, mainly hydrogen and helium. This process is known as recombination, and it led to the release of photons, which we now observe as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.\n\nThe formation of these neutral atoms allowed the universe to become transparent to radiation, enabling the photons from the CMB to travel freely through space. Over time, gravity pulled matter together to form the first stars and galaxies, which eventually led to the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today.\n\nIn summary, the high temperature at the end of the cosmic inflation period was essential for the formation of elementary particles, which later combined to form atoms, stars, and galaxies. The temperature played a critical role in shaping the universe's development and its current structure."
