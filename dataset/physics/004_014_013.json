    "message_2": "The temperature of the universe, as inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, can be determined using the Planck's Law of blackbody radiation. The CMB radiation is the relic radiation from the early universe, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It is a nearly perfect blackbody radiation with a very uniform temperature.\n\nThe Planck's Law for blackbody radiation is given by:\n\nB(ν, T) = (2hν^3/c^2) * (1/(e^(hν/kT) - 1))\n\nwhere:\nB(ν, T) is the spectral radiance (energy per unit area per unit time per unit frequency per unit solid angle)\nν is the frequency of the radiation\nT is the temperature of the blackbody\nh is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nk is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K)\n\nThe peak frequency (ν_max) of the CMB radiation can be found using Wien's Displacement Law:\n\nν_max = b * T\n\nwhere:\nb is Wien's constant (3.29 x 10^10 Hz/K)\n\nThe CMB radiation has a peak frequency of approximately 160.4 GHz (1.604 x 10^11 Hz). Using Wien's Displacement Law, we can find the temperature of the universe:\n\nT = ν_max / b\nT = (1.604 x 10^11 Hz) / (3.29 x 10^10 Hz/K)\nT ≈ 2.725 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the universe, as inferred from the cosmic microwave background radiation, is approximately 2.725 Kelvin."
