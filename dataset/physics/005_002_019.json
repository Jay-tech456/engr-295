    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on the spaceship, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length measured by an observer at rest relative to the object), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the observer on the spaceship is at rest relative to the spaceship, so they would measure the proper length (L0) of the spaceship. To find L0, we can rearrange the length contraction formula:\n\nL0 = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nL = 50 meters (length measured by observers on Earth)\nv = 0.8c (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth)\nc = speed of light ≈ 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL0 = 50 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nL0 = 50 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL0 = 50 / sqrt(0.36)\nL0 = 50 / 0.6\n\nL0 ≈ 83.33 meters\n\nSo the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on the spaceship is approximately 83.33 meters."
