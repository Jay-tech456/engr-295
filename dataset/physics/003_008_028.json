    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the sheet is rectangular, we can simplify the problem by considering the magnetic field produced by two long straight wires carrying the same current, one at the top edge and one at the bottom edge of the sheet.\n\nThe magnetic field produced by a long straight wire carrying a current I at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nFor our problem, we have two wires, one at the top edge (y = 2m) and one at the bottom edge (y = 0m) of the sheet. The point P is located on the y-axis at a distance of 3m from the sheet. So, the distance from the top wire to point P is r1 = 3 - 2 = 1m, and the distance from the bottom wire to point P is r2 = 3m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by each wire at point P:\n\nB1 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r1) = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5A) / (2 * π * 1m) = 10^(-6) T\n\nB2 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r2) = (4 * π * 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5A) / (2 * π * 3m) ≈ 3.33 * 10^(-7) T\n\nSince the magnetic fields produced by the two wires have opposite directions, we need to subtract the smaller magnetic field from the larger one to find the net magnetic field at point P:\n\nB_net = B1 - B2 = 10^(-6) T - 3.33 * 10^(-7) T ≈ 6.67 * 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 6.67 * 10^(-7) T."
