    "message_1": "You are an astronaut traveling in a spaceship at a speed of 0.9c relative to Earth. Suddenly, you encounter a particle moving at a higher speed of 0.95c relative to Earth. Assuming both you and the particle are traveling in the same direction, what is the velocity of the particle relative to you? Additionally, what will be the effect on the energy and speed of the particle if you observe it from your spacecraft's reference frame?",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle relative to you, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv_rel = (v_particle - v_spaceship) / (1 - (v_particle * v_spaceship) / c^2)\n\nwhere v_rel is the relative velocity, v_particle is the velocity of the particle relative to Earth (0.95c), v_spaceship is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth (0.9c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nv_rel = (0.95c - 0.9c) / (1 - (0.95c * 0.9c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (0.05c) / (1 - 0.855c^2 / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (0.05c) / (1 - 0.855)\n\nv_rel = (0.05c) / 0.145\n\nv_rel â‰ˆ 0.3448c\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle relative to you is approximately 0.3448c.\n\nNow, let's discuss the effect on the energy and speed of the particle when observed from your spacecraft's reference frame. The energy of the particle will be affected by the relativistic mass increase due to its velocity. The relativistic mass is given by:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v_rel^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass of the particle, and v_rel is the relative velocity.\n\nSince the relative velocity of the particle is 0.3448c, the relativistic mass will be greater than its rest mass. This means that the energy of the particle will also be greater when observed from your spacecraft's reference frame compared to its energy when observed from Earth's reference frame.\n\nAs for the speed of the particle, it will be observed as moving at a speed of 0.3448c relative to your spacecraft. This is slower than its speed relative to Earth (0.95c), but still a significant fraction of the speed of light."
