    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at a given temperature to its enthalpy of vaporization and molar mass. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nWe are also given the temperature T2 as 25°C, which we need to convert to Kelvin:\n\nT2 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nWe need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (P2). To do this, we need the vapor pressure of water at a known temperature (P1) and the corresponding temperature (T1). We can use the normal boiling point of water as a reference:\n\nT1 = 373.15 K (100°C)\nP1 = 101325 Pa (1 atm)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -40700 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2/101325) ≈ -0.4154\nP2/101325 = e^(-0.4154)\nP2 ≈ 101325 * e^(-0.4154)\nP2 ≈ 3158.8 Pa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3158.8 Pa."
