    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the circular ring, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the circular ring, and x is the distance from the center of the ring along the axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 5 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nx = 15 cm = 0.15 m\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.15 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 5 * 0.01) / (2 * (0.01 + 0.0225)^(3/2))\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7)) / (2 * (0.0325)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-6) / (2 * 0.0325^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-6) / 0.000181\n\nB ≈ 0.0347 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located on the axis of the ring, 15 cm away from the center of the ring, is approximately 0.0347 T (tesla)."
