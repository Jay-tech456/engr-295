    "message_1": "A telescope is tracking a distant star when suddenly a massive object passes between the telescope and the star. As a result, the star appears to shift position. Use the principles of general relativity and gravitational lensing to calculate the mass and distance of the object causing the gravitational lensing effect.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mass and distance of the object causing the gravitational lensing effect, we can use the formula for the Einstein radius, which is a measure of the angular separation between the true position of the star and its apparent position due to lensing.\n\nThe Einstein radius (θ_E) is given by:\n\nθ_E = √(4GM/c² * D_LS / D_L * D_S)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the lensing object, c is the speed of light, D_L is the distance from the observer (telescope) to the lensing object, D_S is the distance from the observer to the star, and D_LS is the distance from the lensing object to the star.\n\nFirst, we need to measure the angular separation (θ_E) between the true position of the star and its apparent position due to lensing. This can be done using the telescope's observations.\n\nNext, we need to determine the distances D_L, D_S, and D_LS. These distances can be estimated using various methods, such as parallax measurements, standard candles, or redshift measurements.\n\nOnce we have the values for θ_E, D_L, D_S, and D_LS, we can rearrange the Einstein radius formula to solve for the mass of the lensing object (M):\n\nM = c² * θ_E² * D_L * D_S / (4G * D_LS)\n\nWith the mass of the lensing object calculated, we can now estimate its distance (D_L) using the measured distances and the Einstein radius formula.\n\nKeep in mind that these calculations involve several assumptions and simplifications, such as treating the lensing object as a point mass and assuming that the lensing effect is due solely to the object's mass. In practice, more sophisticated models and techniques may be needed to account for factors such as the distribution of mass within the lensing object and the presence of other nearby masses."
