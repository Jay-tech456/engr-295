    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the chirp mass formula and the final stages of the inspiral phase before the merger. The chirp mass (M_c) is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the neutron stars. In this case, both neutron stars have masses of 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun). Let's first convert these masses to kilograms:\n\nm1 = m2 = 1.4 * M_sun = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can find the chirp mass:\n\nM_c = (2.7846 x 10^30 * 2.7846 x 10^30)^(3/5) / (2.7846 x 10^30 + 2.7846 x 10^30)^(1/5)\nM_c ≈ 2.527 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves during the final stages of the inspiral phase can be estimated using the formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5 / 96 * π)^(3/8) * (M_c)^(-5/8) * (dE/dt)^(3/8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and dE/dt is the rate of change of energy with respect to time. For neutron star mergers, dE/dt is typically on the order of 10^45 J/s.\n\nf ≈ (3 x 10^8)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11) * (5 / 96 * π)^(3/8) * (2.527 x 10^30)^(-5/8) * (10^45)^(3/8)\nf ≈ 1.5 x 10^3 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger is approximately 1.5 kHz. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency may vary depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and the details of the merger process."
