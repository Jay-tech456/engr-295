    "message_1": "A 2-m-long and 0.1-m-wide rectangular plate is suspended vertically in water with its long edge parallel to the surface. The plate's mass is 5 kg and it has a natural frequency of 5 Hz. Determine the amplitude of the vibrations of the plate when subjected to a harmonic force of 40 N at its natural frequency. Assume that the damping coefficient of the plate is negligible.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude of the vibrations of the plate when subjected to a harmonic force at its natural frequency, we can use the formula for the amplitude of a driven harmonic oscillator:\n\nA = F0 / (m * ω^2)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, F0 is the applied force, m is the mass of the plate, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) from the natural frequency (f):\n\nω = 2 * π * f\n\nGiven that the natural frequency (f) is 5 Hz, we can calculate the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = 2 * π * 5 Hz ≈ 31.42 rad/s\n\nNow we can plug the values into the amplitude formula:\n\nA = F0 / (m * ω^2)\nA = 40 N / (5 kg * (31.42 rad/s)^2)\nA ≈ 40 N / (5 kg * 987.61 rad²/s²)\nA ≈ 40 N / 4938.05 kg * rad²/s²\nA ≈ 0.0081 m\n\nThe amplitude of the vibrations of the plate when subjected to a harmonic force of 40 N at its natural frequency is approximately 0.0081 meters or 8.1 mm."
