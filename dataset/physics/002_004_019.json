(Assume the reaction goes to completion and the specific heat capacity of water vapor is 36.9 J/mol K)",
    "message_2": "a) To find the enthalpy change for the given reaction, we need to multiply the given enthalpy change by the stoichiometric coefficient of the reaction:\n\n2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe stoichiometric coefficient for the given reaction is 2, so we multiply the given enthalpy change by 2:\n\nΔH = 2 * (-286 kJ/mol) = -572 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the given reaction is -572 kJ/mol.\n\nb) To find the energy released or absorbed when 10 g of H₂ reacts with 5 g of O₂, we first need to determine the limiting reactant. The molar mass of H₂ is 2 g/mol, and the molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol.\n\nMoles of H₂ = 10 g / 2 g/mol = 5 mol\nMoles of O₂ = 5 g / 32 g/mol = 0.15625 mol\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio of H₂ to O₂ is 2:1, so we need twice as many moles of H₂ as O₂ for the reaction to go to completion. In this case, O₂ is the limiting reactant.\n\nNow we can calculate the moles of H₂O produced:\n\nMoles of H₂O = 2 * moles of O₂ = 2 * 0.15625 mol = 0.3125 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the energy released or absorbed using the enthalpy change:\n\nEnergy = ΔH * moles of H₂O = -572 kJ/mol * 0.3125 mol = -178.75 kJ\n\nThe energy released when 10 g of H₂ reacts with 5 g of O₂ is 178.75 kJ. Since the enthalpy change is negative, this means that the energy is released during the reaction."
