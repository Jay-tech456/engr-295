    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 T·m/A)\nI is the current (2 A)\nr is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^-7 T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (8 × 10^-7 T) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^-6 Tesla."
