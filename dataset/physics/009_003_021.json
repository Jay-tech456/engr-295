    "message_2": "To determine whether the light ray will undergo total internal reflection, we first need to find the critical angle between the two media. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence in the denser medium (glass) for which the angle of refraction in the rarer medium (air) is 90 degrees. It can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor air, the refractive index (n1) is approximately 1, and for glass, the refractive index (n2) varies depending on the type of glass. We will assume a common value of 1.5 for crown glass.\n\nAt the critical angle, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees. Therefore, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θc):\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\nsin(θc) = 1.5 / 1\nθc = arcsin(1.5)\n\nHowever, the arcsin function has a domain of -1 to 1, and since 1.5 is outside this domain, there is no valid critical angle. This means that total internal reflection is not possible for a light ray passing from air to glass.\n\nNow, let's find the angle of refraction (θ2) for the given angle of incidence (50 degrees) using Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(50°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\nsin(θ2) = sin(50°) / 1.5\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(50°) / 1.5)\n\nθ2 ≈ 30.3°\n\nSince the angle of refraction (30.3°) is less than 90 degrees, the light ray will not undergo total internal reflection when passing from air to glass at an angle of incidence of 50 degrees."
