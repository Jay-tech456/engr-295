    "message_1": "An optics laboratory produces a diffraction grating with 3000 lines per centimeter. A laser beam with a wavelength of 650 nm is projected through this grating, and the diffraction pattern is observed on a screen 2 meters away. What is the angle between the central maximum and the first-order maximum?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the central maximum and the first-order maximum, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of the maximum (n = 1 for the first-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light (650 nm), d is the distance between the lines on the grating, and θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first-order maximum.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating. Since there are 3000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate the distance between the lines as follows:\n\nd = 1 cm / 3000 lines = 1/3000 cm = 1/30000 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the diffraction grating equation:\n\n1 * (650 * 10^(-9) m) = (1/30000 m) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (650 * 10^(-9) m) / (1/30000 m)\n\nsin(θ) = 0.0195\n\nθ = arcsin(0.0195)\n\nθ ≈ 1.12°\n\nSo, the angle between the central maximum and the first-order maximum is approximately 1.12°."
