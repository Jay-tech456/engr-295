    "message_1": "A 635 nm laser beam is passed through a single slit of width 0.025 mm. If the distance between the slit and the screen is 2 m, determine the distance between the first and the third bright fringes on the screen. (Assuming the slit is narrow and the screen is located far away from it).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 3 for the third bright fringe, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's find the angular positions of the first and third bright fringes:\n\nθ₁ = (1 * 635 * 10^(-9)) / (0.025 * 10^(-3))\nθ₁ = 2.54 * 10^(-5) radians\n\nθ₃ = (3 * 635 * 10^(-9)) / (0.025 * 10^(-3))\nθ₃ = 7.62 * 10^(-5) radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance between the first and third bright fringes on the screen:\n\nx₁ = L * θ₁\nx₁ = 2 * 2.54 * 10^(-5)\nx₁ = 5.08 * 10^(-5) m\n\nx₃ = L * θ₃\nx₃ = 2 * 7.62 * 10^(-5)\nx₃ = 1.524 * 10^(-4) m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first and third bright fringes:\n\nΔx = x₃ - x₁\nΔx = 1.524 * 10^(-4) - 5.08 * 10^(-5)\nΔx = 1.016 * 10^(-4) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and third bright fringes on the screen is approximately 1.016 * 10^(-4) meters or 10.16 mm."
