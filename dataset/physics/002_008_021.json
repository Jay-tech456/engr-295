    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a piece of copper with a mass of 100 grams when it absorbs 200 joules of heat and its temperature increases from 25°C to 50°C?",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed (200 Joules), m is the mass of the copper (100 grams), c is the specific heat capacity we want to find, and ΔT is the change in temperature (50°C - 25°C = 25°C).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 200 J / (100 g × 25°C)\n\nc = 200 J / 2500 g°C\n\nc = 0.08 J/(g°C)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the piece of copper is 0.08 J/(g°C)."
