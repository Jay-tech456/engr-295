    "message_2": "To calculate the bending angle of light passing near a non-rotating black hole, we can use the formula for the deflection angle (Δθ) in the weak field limit:\n\nΔθ ≈ (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the distance of closest approach).\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the black hole in kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 1,000,000 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^36 kg\n\nNext, let's find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nPlugging in the values for G, M, and c:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^36 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.954 x 10^9 m\n\nNow, we can find the impact parameter (b) by multiplying the Schwarzschild radius by 1000:\n\nb = 1000 * Rs = 1000 * 2.954 x 10^9 m = 2.954 x 10^12 m\n\nFinally, we can plug in the values into the formula for the deflection angle:\n\nΔθ ≈ (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^36 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * 2.954 x 10^12 m\nΔθ ≈ 1.75 x 10^-6 radians\n\nTo convert the angle to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 radian = 206,265 arcseconds:\n\nΔθ ≈ 1.75 x 10^-6 radians * 206,265 arcseconds/radian ≈ 0.361 arcseconds\n\nSo, the predicted bending angle of light passing near a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses at a distance of 1000 Schwarzschild radii is approximately 0.361 arcseconds."
