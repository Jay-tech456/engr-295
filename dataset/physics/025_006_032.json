    "message_2": "The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines provide maximum allowable exposure limits to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation for both workers (occupational exposure) and the general public (public exposure). These limits are based on the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation and are expressed in terms of power density (W/m²) or electric and magnetic field strength (V/m and A/m, respectively).\n\nFor workers who are continuously exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation, the ICNIRP guidelines provide the following limits:\n\n- For frequencies between 100 kHz and 10 GHz, the maximum allowable power density is 10 W/m² (or 2 W/m² for frequencies between 400 MHz and 2 GHz).\n- For frequencies between 10 GHz and 300 GHz, the maximum allowable power density is 50 W/m².\n\nFor the general public, the exposure limits are lower:\n\n- For frequencies between 100 kHz and 10 GHz, the maximum allowable power density is 2 W/m² (or 0.4 W/m² for frequencies between 400 MHz and 2 GHz).\n- For frequencies between 10 GHz and 300 GHz, the maximum allowable power density is 10 W/m².\n\nIn summary, the maximum allowable exposure limits for workers are generally higher than those for the general public, reflecting the assumption that workers are more likely to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions. The ICNIRP guidelines aim to protect both groups from potential adverse health effects due to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation exposure."
