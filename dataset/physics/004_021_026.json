    "message_2": "The final fate of a massive star depends on its mass and the balance between the gravitational forces trying to collapse the star and the outward pressure forces, such as radiation pressure and gas pressure, trying to counteract the collapse. According to the theory of General Relativity, massive stars can undergo gravitational collapse and form either a supernova or a black hole.\n\n1. Supernova: If a massive star has a mass between 8 and 20 solar masses, it will likely undergo a supernova explosion. During its lifetime, the star undergoes nuclear fusion, converting lighter elements into heavier ones and releasing energy in the process. Once the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure forces decrease, and the gravitational forces take over, causing the core to collapse. The outer layers of the star bounce off the dense core, creating a shockwave that results in a supernova explosion. The remnants of the core can form a neutron star, which is a highly dense object composed mainly of neutrons.\n\n2. Black Hole: If a massive star has a mass greater than 20 solar masses, it is more likely to form a black hole. In this case, the core collapse is so extreme that not even the neutron degeneracy pressure can counteract the gravitational forces. The core continues to collapse until it forms a singularity, a point of infinite density. The region around the singularity where the escape velocity equals the speed of light is called the event horizon, and this marks the boundary of the black hole. Once an object crosses the event horizon, it cannot escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nThe energy and mass of the star play crucial roles in determining its ultimate fate. The more massive a star is, the greater the gravitational forces acting on it, and the more likely it is to form a black hole. On the other hand, stars with lower masses may not have enough gravitational force to overcome the outward pressure forces, resulting in a supernova explosion and the formation of a neutron star.\n\nIn conclusion, the final fate of a massive star undergoing gravitational collapse per the theory of General Relativity can be either a supernova or a black hole, depending on the mass and energy of the star. The balance between gravitational forces and outward pressure forces determines whether the star will explode as a supernova or collapse into a black hole."
