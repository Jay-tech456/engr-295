    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 20 cm and u = -30 cm (object distance is negative for a concave mirror)\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by -60v:\n\n-3v = 2v - 60\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n5v = 60\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12/(-30)\n\nM = 12/30\n\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is 2/5 or 0.4."
