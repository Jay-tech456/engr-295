    "message_1": "A current-carrying wire with a length of 1 meter is bent into a circular loop with a radius of 5 cm. Find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop, if the current passing through the wire is 2 A.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field. In this case, we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, so x = 0.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converting to meters)\nI = 2 A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.05 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * 0.0025 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (0.0025 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB ≈ 0.000503292 T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 0.000503292 Tesla."
