    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a relativistic particle scattering at a particular angle given its initial energy and the energy of the target particle, we need to use the differential cross-section formula. The differential cross-section (dσ/dΩ) represents the probability of scattering into a solid angle dΩ.\n\nFor relativistic particles, the scattering process can be described by the Mandelstam variables s, t, and u, which are related to the initial and final energies and momenta of the particles. The specific formula for the differential cross-section depends on the type of interaction between the particles (e.g., electromagnetic, strong, or weak interaction).\n\nIn general, the differential cross-section can be written as:\n\ndσ/dΩ = f(s, t, u)\n\nwhere f(s, t, u) is a function that depends on the specific interaction and the Mandelstam variables.\n\nTo find the probability of scattering at a particular angle θ, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the solid angle:\n\nP(θ) = ∫(dσ/dΩ) dΩ\n\nThe limits of integration depend on the specific scattering process and the range of possible scattering angles.\n\nTo solve this problem, you would need more information about the type of interaction and the specific scattering process. Additionally, you would need to know the relationship between the Mandelstam variables and the initial energy and target particle energy. Once you have this information, you can calculate the probability of scattering at a particular angle using the differential cross-section formula and integration."
