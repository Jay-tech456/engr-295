What is the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger onboard the spaceship, according to the theory of length contraction in special relativity?",
    "message_2": "According to the theory of length contraction in special relativity, the length of an object moving at a high velocity with respect to an observer will appear shorter than its proper length (the length as measured in the object's rest frame). The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length, v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the contracted length (L = 120 meters) and the velocity (v = 0.8c). We need to find the proper length (L0), which is the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger onboard the spaceship.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for L0, we get:\n\nL0 = L / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nL0 = 120 meters / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\n\nL0 = 120 meters / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL0 = 120 meters / sqrt(0.36)\n\nL0 = 120 meters / 0.6\n\nL0 = 200 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger onboard the spaceship is 200 meters."
