The speed of light in vacuum is 3 x 10^8 m/s while in the medium it is 2 x 10^8 m/s. What is the refractive index of the medium?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of the medium, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the angle of incidence (θ1) is 30 degrees, and the angle of refraction (θ2) is 20 degrees. The refractive index of the vacuum (n1) is 1, since the speed of light in vacuum is the maximum possible speed of light.\n\nWe are also given the speed of light in the medium (v2) as 2 x 10^8 m/s. The refractive index of the medium (n2) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn2 = c / v2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nn2 = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.5\n\nNow we can use Snell's Law to solve for the refractive index of the medium:\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(20°)\n\nsin(20°) = 0.5 / 1.5 = 1/3\n\nNow we have the value of sin(θ2). Since we already know the refractive index of the medium (n2 = 1.5), we can confirm that the given angles of incidence and refraction are consistent with the refractive index value:\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.5 * sin(20°)\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * (1/3)\n\n0.5 = 0.5\n\nThe given angles of incidence and refraction are consistent with the refractive index of the medium, which is 1.5."
