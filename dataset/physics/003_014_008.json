    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the rectangular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a²) / (2 * (a² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a is the radius of an equivalent circular loop with the same area as the rectangular loop, and z is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, let's find the equivalent radius a. The area of the rectangular loop is:\n\nArea = length * width = 5 cm * 10 cm = 50 cm² = 0.0050 m²\n\nFor an equivalent circular loop with the same area:\n\nArea = π * a²\n\nSolving for a:\n\na² = Area / π\na = sqrt(Area / π) = sqrt(0.0050 m² / π) = 0.0397 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field B at the point 15 cm (0.15 m) away from the center of the loop:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.0397 m²) / (2 * (0.0397 m² + 0.15 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.0397 m²) / (0.0397 m² + 0.0225 m²)^(3/2)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.0397 m²) / (0.0622 m²)^(3/2)\nB ≈ 2.01 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the loop, 15 cm away from the center of the loop, is approximately 2.01 × 10^(-5) T."
