    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) for the reaction. We can find these values using the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard molar entropies (S°) for the reactants and products.\n\nΔH° = Σ(ΔHf° of products) - Σ(ΔHf° of reactants)\nΔS° = Σ(S° of products) - Σ(S° of reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 298 K are:\n\nH2(g): 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nO2(g): 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nH2O(g): -241.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe standard molar entropies (S°) at 298 K are:\n\nH2(g): 130.7 J/mol·K\nO2(g): 205.2 J/mol·K\nH2O(g): 188.8 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction:\n\nΔH° = [2 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 × (0 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol] = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\nΔS° = [2 × (188.8 J/mol·K)] - [2 × (130.7 J/mol·K) + 205.2 J/mol·K] = 377.6 - 466.6 = -89 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔG using the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS:\n\nΔG = (-483.6 kJ/mol) - (298 K × (-89 J/mol·K) × (1 kJ/1000 J))\n\nΔG = -483.6 kJ/mol + 26.5 kJ/mol = -457.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 298 K and 1 atm is -457.1 kJ/mol."
