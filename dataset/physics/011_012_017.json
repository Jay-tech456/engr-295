    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility of a cubic crystal with 1000 randomly distributed spins using the spin glass model, we will use the following formula:\n\nχ = (Nμ²)/(3kT)\n\nwhere χ is the magnetic susceptibility, N is the number of spins, μ is the magnetic moment per spin, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnetic moment per spin (μ). In the spin glass model, the magnetic moment per spin is given by:\n\nμ = √(J² + D²)\n\nwhere J is the exchange constant and D is the anisotropy constant. In this case, J = 1.5 K and D = 0.5 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nμ = √((1.5 K)² + (0.5 K)²) = √(2.25 K² + 0.25 K²) = √(2.5 K²) = 1.58 K\n\nNow that we have the magnetic moment per spin, we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility using the formula:\n\nχ = (Nμ²)/(3kT)\n\nWe are given N = 1000 spins, T = 10 K, and the Boltzmann constant k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = (1000 × (1.58 K)²) / (3 × 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K × 10 K)\n\nχ = (1000 × 2.4964 K²) / (4.14 × 10⁻²² J)\n\nχ = 2.4964 × 10³ K² / 4.14 × 10⁻²² J\n\nχ ≈ 6.03 × 10²² m³/J\n\nThus, the magnetic susceptibility of the cubic crystal with 1000 randomly distributed spins at a temperature of 10 Kelvin, when the exchange constant is 1.5 K and the anisotropy constant is 0.5 K, is approximately 6.03 × 10²² m³/J."
