    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 3di + 2di\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\n5di = 60\n\nNext, divide by 5:\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is 12 cm.\n\nNow, to calculate the magnification (M), we can use the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -12/30\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nM = -2/5\n\nThe magnification is -2/5 or -0.4. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
