    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence (θi) at which the reflected light is completely polarized is related to the refractive index (n) of the material by the following equation:\n\ntan(θi) = n\n\nIn this case, the refractive index of the material is given as 1.5. To find the angle of incidence, we need to find the inverse tangent (arctangent) of the refractive index:\n\nθi = arctan(n)\nθi = arctan(1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθi ≈ 56.31°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence for which the reflected light off the surface is completely polarized according to Brewster's Law is approximately 56.31°."
