    "message_2": "Time dilation is a phenomenon in which time appears to pass at different rates for two observers due to their relative motion or the presence of a gravitational field. In the context of a gravitational well, time dilation is described by the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations in general relativity.\n\nFor a photon of light passing through a gravitational well, the time dilation experienced can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - 2GM/c^2R)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time experienced by an observer at a distance R from the massive object (gravitational well)\nΔt0 is the proper time experienced by an observer far away from the massive object\nG is the gravitational constant\nM is the mass of the massive object\nc is the speed of light\nR is the radial coordinate (distance from the massive object)\n\nHowever, it is important to note that photons do not experience time in the same way as objects with mass. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their proper time (Δt0) is always zero. This means that, from the photon's perspective, it does not experience any time dilation.\n\nNevertheless, an observer watching the photon pass through the gravitational well would observe time dilation effects, as the photon's frequency and wavelength would be affected by the gravitational field. This phenomenon is known as gravitational redshift or blueshift, depending on whether the photon is moving away from or towards the massive object, respectively."
