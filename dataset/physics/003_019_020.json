    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a radial distance of 5 mm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a coaxial cable, we can assume that the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the cable. We can choose a circular path of radius r (5 mm in this case) centered on the cable as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field will be constant along this loop, so we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = B * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the loop is outside the cable (5 mm > 4 mm), the entire current of 5 A is enclosed by the loop. Therefore, we can write:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 5 × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (10π × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a radial distance of 5 mm from the center of the coaxial cable is 2 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
