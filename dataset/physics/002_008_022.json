    "message_1": "A physics student wants to investigate the specific heat capacity of a metal. To do this, the student takes a piece of the metal of mass 50g and heats it up to a temperature of 100°C. The student then drops the metal into a beaker of water with a mass of 200g and temperature of 20°C. The final temperature of the water and metal is 35°C. Calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat gained by the water is equal to the heat lost by the metal.\n\nLet's denote the specific heat capacity of the metal as c_metal and the specific heat capacity of water as c_water (which is 4.18 J/g°C).\n\nHeat gained by water = Heat lost by metal\n\nm_water * c_water * ΔT_water = m_metal * c_metal * ΔT_metal\n\nwhere m_water and m_metal are the masses of water and metal, and ΔT_water and ΔT_metal are the changes in temperature of water and metal, respectively.\n\nWe have:\n\nm_water = 200 g\nc_water = 4.18 J/g°C\nΔT_water = 35°C - 20°C = 15°C\n\nm_metal = 50 g\nΔT_metal = 100°C - 35°C = 65°C\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for c_metal:\n\n200 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 15°C = 50 g * c_metal * 65°C\n\n12540 J = 3250 g°C * c_metal\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3250 g°C:\n\nc_metal = 12540 J / 3250 g°C\nc_metal ≈ 3.86 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the metal is approximately 3.86 J/g°C."
