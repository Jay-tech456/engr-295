How does this relationship affect the detectability of axion dark matter through experimental measurements such as the axion-electron coupling experiment?",
    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are also considered as a candidate for dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that makes up a significant portion of the universe's mass. In comparison to other proposed dark matter particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions have a much smaller mass and weaker interaction strength with ordinary matter.\n\nThe mass of axions is expected to be in the range of 10^-6 eV to 10^-3 eV, which is significantly lighter than the mass of WIMPs, which is typically in the range of 10 GeV to 1 TeV. The interaction strength of axions with ordinary matter is also weaker than that of WIMPs. Axions interact primarily through their coupling to photons and electrons, with the axion-photon coupling being the most dominant interaction.\n\nThe relationship between the mass and interaction strength of axion dark matter affects its detectability in experimental measurements. Due to their small mass and weak interaction strength, axions are challenging to detect directly. However, several experimental techniques have been developed to search for axion dark matter, including the axion-electron coupling experiment.\n\nIn the axion-electron coupling experiment, the interaction between axions and electrons is probed by measuring the energy spectrum of electrons in a magnetic field. The presence of axions would cause a small shift in the energy spectrum, which can be detected if the experiment is sensitive enough. The detectability of axion dark matter in this type of experiment depends on the strength of the axion-electron coupling, which is related to the axion mass.\n\nIn summary, axion dark matter has a smaller mass and weaker interaction strength compared to other dark matter candidates like WIMPs. This relationship makes axions challenging to detect directly, but experimental techniques such as the axion-electron coupling experiment have been developed to search for their presence. The detectability of axion dark matter in these experiments depends on the strength of the axion-electron coupling, which is related to the axion mass."
