    "message_2": "The current prevailing theory for the origin of the universe is the Big Bang Theory. This theory posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense state, and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The Big Bang Theory is supported by a variety of observational evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the observed abundance of light elements, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory has evolved over time as new evidence and discoveries have been made in the field of cosmology. Some key milestones in the development of the theory include:\n\n1. Hubble's Law (1929): Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other, suggesting that the universe is expanding. This observation provided the first evidence for the Big Bang Theory.\n\n2. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) (1964): Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally discovered the CMBR, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang. This radiation fills the entire universe and has a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin. The discovery of the CMBR provided strong evidence for the Big Bang Theory and earned Penzias and Wilson the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.\n\n3. Inflation Theory (1980): Alan Guth proposed the idea of cosmic inflation, which suggests that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This theory helps explain the uniformity of the CMBR and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n4. Dark Matter and Dark Energy (1990s): Observations of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe led to the realization that the majority of the universe's mass is made up of dark matter, which does not interact with light. Additionally, the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe led to the proposal of dark energy, an unknown form of energy that is driving this acceleration. Both dark matter and dark energy are now important components of the Big Bang Theory.\n\n5. Planck Satellite (2009-2013): The European Space Agency's Planck satellite provided the most precise measurements of the CMBR to date, allowing for more accurate estimates of the age, composition, and geometry of the universe. These measurements further refined and supported the Big Bang Theory.\n\nIn summary, the Big Bang Theory has evolved over time as new evidence and discoveries have been made in the field of cosmology. The theory continues to be refined and tested as new observations and experiments are conducted, providing a deeper understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe."
