    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole (M) and the size of its event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), is given by the Schwarzschild equation:\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the event horizon size of a black hole with a mass equivalent to that of the sun, we can use the solar mass (Ms) as the mass of the black hole. The solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg.\n\nRs = (2 * G * Ms) / c^2\nRs = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs ≈ (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 * 1.989 × 10^30) / (2.998 × 10^8)^2\nRs ≈ 2.954 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon size (Schwarzschild radius) of a black hole with a mass equivalent to that of the sun is approximately 2.954 × 10^3 meters, or about 2.954 kilometers."
