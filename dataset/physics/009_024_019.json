The first filter is oriented at 30 degrees to the plane of polarized light and the second filter is oriented at an angle θ to the first filter. The angle θ needs to be determined.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Malus's Law, which states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizing filters is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between their transmission axes.\n\nMathematically, Malus's Law is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two filters.\n\nIn this problem, the transmitted intensity (I) is 1/4th of the original intensity (I₀), and the first filter is oriented at 30 degrees to the plane of polarized light. We need to find the angle θ between the two filters.\n\nSince the first filter is oriented at 30 degrees to the plane of polarized light, the angle between the plane of polarized light and the second filter is (30 + θ) degrees. Therefore, we can write Malus's Law as:\n\n1/4 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(30 + θ)\n\nDividing both sides by I₀, we get:\n\n1/4 = cos²(30 + θ)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n1/2 = cos(30 + θ)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle (30 + θ) for which the cosine is equal to 1/2. The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2, so:\n\n30 + θ = 60\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nθ = 60 - 30\nθ = 30 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two polarizing filters is 30 degrees when the intensity of transmitted light becomes 1/4th of the original intensity."
