    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They have been proposed as a possible candidate for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nThe estimated mass range of primordial black holes that could potentially make up dark matter is quite broad, spanning from extremely small (subatomic) scales to thousands of solar masses. However, several constraints have been placed on this mass range through a combination of observational techniques and theoretical models.\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the radiation left over from the early universe, and its properties can be used to constrain the abundance of PBHs. If there were too many massive PBHs, they would have affected the CMB's anisotropies. Current CMB data from the Planck satellite suggests that PBHs with masses above 10^3 solar masses cannot make up a significant fraction of dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Massive objects like PBHs can bend light from distant sources, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing events, such as those from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and the Hubble Space Telescope, have placed constraints on the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of 10^-8 to 10 solar masses.\n\n3. Gravitational wave observations: The merger of black holes can produce gravitational waves, which have been detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The observed rate of black hole mergers can be used to constrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of 1 to 100 solar masses.\n\n4. Dynamical effects on stars and galaxies: The presence of PBHs in large numbers could affect the dynamics of stars and galaxies. Observations of the motion of stars in the Milky Way and the distribution of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way have been used to constrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of 10^-6 to 10^2 solar masses.\n\n5. Gamma-ray and X-ray background: PBHs can emit high-energy radiation through the Hawking radiation process. Observations of the gamma-ray and X-ray background have been used to constrain the abundance of PBHs with masses below 10^15 grams (about 10^-18 solar masses).\n\nConsidering these constraints, it is still possible that PBHs with masses in the range of 10^-18 to 10^-8 solar masses and around 1 to 100 solar masses could potentially make up a significant fraction of dark matter. However, more research and observations are needed to confirm or rule out this possibility."
