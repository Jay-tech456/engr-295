    "message_2": "To estimate the expected rate of gravitational wave detections from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the observable universe, we need to consider several factors, including the sensitivity of current detection technology, the formation and evolution of IMBHs, and the rate of events involving IMBHs that produce gravitational waves.\n\n1. Detection technology: The current generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are primarily sensitive to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars. Their sensitivity to IMBHs is limited, especially for higher mass IMBHs (above 100 solar masses). Future detectors, like LISA and Einstein Telescope, will have improved sensitivity to IMBHs, increasing the chances of detecting gravitational waves from these sources.\n\n2. Formation and evolution of IMBHs: The formation and evolution of IMBHs are still not well understood. There are several proposed formation scenarios, including the direct collapse of massive stars, runaway collisions in dense star clusters, and hierarchical mergers of smaller black holes. The rate of IMBH formation and the resulting mass distribution will affect the expected detection rate of gravitational waves from these sources.\n\n3. Rate of events involving IMBHs: The rate of events involving IMBHs that produce gravitational waves, such as mergers with other black holes or neutron stars, depends on the population of IMBHs and their environments. The local merger rate of IMBHs is highly uncertain due to the limited understanding of their formation and evolution.\n\nGiven these uncertainties, it is challenging to provide a precise expected rate of gravitational wave detections from IMBHs in the observable universe. However, as our understanding of IMBHs improves and the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors increases, we can expect to detect more gravitational wave events involving IMBHs in the future."
