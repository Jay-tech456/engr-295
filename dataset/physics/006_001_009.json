    "message_2": "To calculate the energy levels and wavelengths of the photons emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from the n = 4 state to the n = 2 state, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Energy difference between the two levels (ΔE):\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level, and ni is the initial energy level.\n\n2. Wavelength of the emitted photon (λ):\nλ = hc / ΔE\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and ΔE is the energy difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy difference between the two levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/4^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1/16)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (12/64)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * 0.1875\nΔE = -2.55 eV\n\nNow, let's convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nΔE = -2.55 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\nΔE = -4.085 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon:\n\nλ = hc / ΔE\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (-4.085 x 10^-19 J)\nλ = 4.867 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the energy difference between the n = 4 and n = 2 states is -2.55 eV (or -4.085 x 10^-19 J), and the wavelength of the emitted photon is approximately 4.867 x 10^-7 m (or 486.7 nm)."
