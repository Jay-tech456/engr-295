    "message_2": "A star with an initial mass of 20 times that of the Sun is classified as a massive star. When such a star exhausts all its nuclear fuel, it undergoes several stages before reaching its final fate. Here's a brief overview of the process:\n\n1. Main Sequence: The star spends most of its lifetime in the main sequence phase, where it burns hydrogen in its core through nuclear fusion, producing helium as a byproduct. The energy released during this process provides the necessary outward pressure to counteract the inward pull of gravity.\n\n2. Helium Burning: Once the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, the core contracts and heats up, while a hydrogen-burning shell forms around it. The increased temperature and pressure in the core allow helium to start fusing into carbon and oxygen. This phase is relatively short compared to the main sequence phase.\n\n3. Advanced Nuclear Burning: As the helium in the core is depleted, the core contracts further, and heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and neon start to undergo fusion. This process continues, with the star forming shells of different elements burning around the core. The outer layers of the star expand, and it becomes a red supergiant.\n\n4. Core Collapse and Supernova: When the core starts fusing silicon into iron, the end is near. Iron cannot undergo fusion to release energy, so the core becomes unstable and collapses under its own gravity. This collapse happens rapidly, causing the outer layers of the star to fall inward and then rebound in a massive explosion called a supernova.\n\n5. Final Fate: The fate of the star after the supernova depends on the mass of its core. For a star with an initial mass of 20 times that of the Sun, the core is likely to be between 3 and 20 solar masses. In this case, the core will continue to collapse under gravity, forming a black hole. A black hole is an extremely dense object with such strong gravity that not even light can escape from it.\n\nIn summary, a star with an initial mass of 20 times that of the Sun is expected to end its life as a black hole after going through the main sequence, helium burning, advanced nuclear burning, and a core-collapse supernova. The reason for this fate is the star's high mass, which leads to the production of heavier elements through nuclear fusion and ultimately results in a core collapse and the formation of a black hole."
