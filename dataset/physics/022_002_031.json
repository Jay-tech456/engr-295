    "message_2": "The current best estimate of the abundance of dark matter in the universe is that it makes up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. This estimate is obtained through a combination of various observational and theoretical methods, including:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the composition of the universe. By analyzing the CMB data, particularly from the Planck satellite, scientists have been able to determine the relative abundance of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in the universe.\n\n2. Large Scale Structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. By studying the large scale structure of the universe, scientists can infer the amount of dark matter needed to explain the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n3. Gravitational Lensing: Dark matter affects the path of light from distant objects due to its gravitational influence. By studying the bending of light around massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, scientists can estimate the amount of dark matter present in these objects.\n\n4. Galaxy Rotation Curves: The rotation curves of galaxies provide information about the distribution of mass within galaxies. Observations show that the rotation curves remain flat at large distances from the galactic center, which implies the presence of a significant amount of dark matter in the outer regions of galaxies.\n\n5. Cosmic Nucleosynthesis: The abundance of light elements, such as helium and deuterium, produced in the early universe depends on the density of ordinary matter (baryons). By comparing the observed abundance of these elements with theoretical predictions, scientists can estimate the density of ordinary matter, and hence, the abundance of dark matter in the universe.\n\nBy combining these various lines of evidence, scientists have arrived at the current best estimate that dark matter constitutes about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, with ordinary matter making up about 5%, and dark energy accounting for the remaining 68%."
