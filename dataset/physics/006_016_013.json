    "message_2": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency for a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nNMR frequency = Gyromagnetic ratio × Magnetic field strength\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio for hydrogen is 42.58 MHz/T and the magnetic field strength is 1.5 Tesla, we can calculate the NMR frequency as follows:\n\nNMR frequency = 42.58 MHz/T × 1.5 T\n\nNMR frequency = 63.87 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field with a strength of 1.5 Tesla is 63.87 MHz."
