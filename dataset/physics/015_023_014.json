    "message_2": "Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are black holes with masses in the range of 100 to 100,000 solar masses. The detection of gravitational waves from these black holes depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the distance to the source.\n\nCurrent gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are sensitive to black hole mergers with masses in the range of a few solar masses up to several tens of solar masses. The sensitivity of these detectors decreases with increasing mass, so the minimum mass range for IMBHs that can be detected through gravitational waves would be around 100 solar masses.\n\nThe expected frequency of gravitational waves from IMBHs depends on the rate at which these black holes merge. This rate is currently uncertain due to the limited observational data available for IMBHs. However, as more detections are made and our understanding of the population of IMBHs improves, we will be able to better constrain the expected frequency of gravitational waves from these sources.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the merging black holes and the distance to the source. For IMBHs, the amplitude is expected to be larger than that of smaller black holes due to their larger masses. However, the amplitude will also decrease with increasing distance to the source, so the detectability of these waves will depend on the distribution of IMBHs in the universe and the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass range of IMBHs that can be detected through gravitational waves is around 100 solar masses. The expected frequency and amplitude of these waves are currently uncertain due to limited observational data, but ongoing detections and improvements in detector sensitivity will help to better constrain these values in the future."
