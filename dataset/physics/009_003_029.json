    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (θ₁) to the sine of the angle of refraction (θ₂) is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(θ₂)\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of refraction (θ₂) must be 90 degrees. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θ₁). The refractive index of air (n₁) is approximately 1, and the refractive index of the transparent material (n₂) is given as 1.5. So, the equation becomes:\n\n1 * sin(θ₁) = 1.5\n\nsin(θ₁) = 1.5\n\nTo find the critical angle, we need to take the inverse sine (sin⁻¹) of both sides:\n\nθ₁ = sin⁻¹(1.5)\n\nHowever, the sine function has a maximum value of 1, so sin⁻¹(1.5) is not possible. This means that total internal reflection cannot occur in this case, as the refractive index of the transparent material is too high compared to that of air."
