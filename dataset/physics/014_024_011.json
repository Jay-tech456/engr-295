    "message_2": "The energy distribution of cosmic rays is closely related to their interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from various sources such as supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and other high-energy astrophysical processes. The interstellar medium is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between star systems in a galaxy, consisting of gas, dust, and cosmic rays.\n\nThe relationship between the energy distribution of cosmic rays and their interaction with the interstellar medium can be described as follows:\n\n1. Propagation: As cosmic rays travel through the ISM, they interact with the magnetic fields, gas, and dust particles present in the medium. These interactions cause the cosmic rays to scatter, changing their direction and energy distribution. Lower-energy cosmic rays are more affected by these interactions, while higher-energy cosmic rays can penetrate deeper into the ISM.\n\n2. Energy loss: Cosmic rays lose energy through various processes as they interact with the ISM. These processes include ionization, where cosmic rays collide with atoms and molecules in the ISM, transferring energy and creating ionized particles; and adiabatic energy loss, where cosmic rays lose energy due to the expansion of the universe.\n\n3. Acceleration: Cosmic rays can also gain energy through interactions with the ISM, particularly in shock waves generated by supernovae explosions or other energetic events. These shock waves can accelerate cosmic rays to extremely high energies, contributing to the observed energy distribution.\n\nThe interaction between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium can affect the formation and evolution of celestial objects such as stars and galaxies in several ways:\n\n1. Heating and ionization: The energy transferred from cosmic rays to the ISM can heat and ionize the gas, affecting the thermal and chemical properties of the medium. This can influence the process of star formation, as the temperature and ionization state of the gas can determine the rate at which it collapses under gravity to form new stars.\n\n2. Magnetic field amplification: Cosmic rays can also contribute to the amplification of magnetic fields in the ISM through a process called the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo. This can affect the structure and evolution of galaxies, as magnetic fields play a crucial role in shaping the distribution of gas and dust, and in regulating star formation.\n\n3. Chemical enrichment: Cosmic rays can induce nuclear reactions in the ISM, producing new elements and isotopes. This process, known as cosmic-ray spallation, can contribute to the chemical enrichment of the medium and the subsequent formation of stars and planets with diverse elemental compositions.\n\nIn summary, the energy distribution of cosmic rays and their interaction with the interstellar medium play a significant role in shaping the properties of the ISM and influencing the formation and evolution of celestial objects such as stars and galaxies."
