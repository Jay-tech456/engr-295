    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards a planet at a speed of 0.8c. The planet emits a signal at a frequency of 10 GHz. What frequency will the spaceship detect the signal at? (Assuming the speed of light is c)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Doppler effect formula for the frequency shift of electromagnetic waves due to relative motion between the source and the observer. The formula is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (c + v) / (c - v)\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency detected by the spaceship, f_source is the frequency emitted by the planet (10 GHz), c is the speed of light, and v is the speed of the spaceship (0.8c).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * (1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8)\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * 1.8 / 0.2\n\nf_observed = 90 GHz\n\nSo, the spaceship will detect the signal at a frequency of 90 GHz."
