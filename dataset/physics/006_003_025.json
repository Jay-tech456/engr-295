    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. For a hydrogen atom, we can calculate the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect using the following formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j * g_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, m_j is the magnetic quantum number, and g_j is the Landé g-factor.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * ħ / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.055 x 10^-34 Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg).\n\nCalculating the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.602 x 10^-19 C) * (1.055 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\n\nNow, let's consider the hydrogen atom in the n=2 state. In this state, there are two possible values for the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l): l=0 (2s) and l=1 (2p). For l=0, the magnetic quantum number (m_l) is also 0, and there is no splitting of the spectral lines. For l=1, there are three possible values for m_l: -1, 0, and 1.\n\nThe Landé g-factor (g_j) for hydrogen can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ng_j = 1 + (j(j+1) + s(s+1) - l(l+1)) / (2j(j+1))\n\nwhere j is the total angular momentum quantum number, l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and s is the electron spin quantum number (s=1/2 for hydrogen).\n\nFor l=1, we have two possible values for j: j=1/2 and j=3/2. Let's calculate the g_j for both cases:\n\nFor j=1/2:\ng_j = 1 + (1/2(1/2+1) + 1/2(1/2+1) - 1(1+1)) / (2 * 1/2(1/2+1))\ng_j = 1 + (-1/2) / (3/2)\ng_j = 2/3\n\nFor j=3/2:\ng_j = 1 + (3/2(3/2+1) + 1/2(1/2+1) - 1(1+1)) / (2 * 3/2(3/2+1))\ng_j = 1 + (5/2) / (15/2)\ng_j = 4/3\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy shift (ΔE) for each m_j value:\n\nFor m_j = -1:\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j * g_j\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (2 T) * (-1) * (2/3)\nΔE ≈ -1.236 x 10^-23 J\n\nFor m_j = 0:\nΔE = 0 (since there is no splitting for m_j = 0)\n\nFor m_j = 1:\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j * g_j\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (2 T) * (1) * (4/3)\nΔE ≈ 2.472 x 10^-23 J\n\nSo, in a 2 T magnetic field, the hydrogen atom's spectral lines will split into three lines with energy shifts of approximately -1.236 x 10^-23 J, 0, and 2.472 x 10^-23 J."
