    "message_1": "A sample of a substance has a critical temperature of 60°C and a critical pressure of 5 atm. If the vapor pressure of this substance at a given temperature is 2 atm, what percentage of its molecules are present in the vapor phase? Assume ideal behavior.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe know the critical pressure (Pc) and critical temperature (Tc) of the substance, and we are given the vapor pressure (P2) at a certain temperature (T2). We can use the critical point to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization using the Watson equation:\n\nΔHvap = 0.82 * R * Tc\n\nFirst, we need to convert the critical temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nTc = 60°C + 273.15 = 333.15 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nΔHvap = 0.82 * R * 333.15 K\n\nSince we are dealing with atm, we will use the value of R = 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K):\n\nΔHvap = 0.82 * 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K) * 333.15 K = 22.49 L*atm/mol\n\nNow, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the temperature T2 at which the vapor pressure is 2 atm. We will use the critical point as our reference state (P1 = 5 atm, T1 = 333.15 K):\n\nln(2/5) = (22.49 L*atm/mol / 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K)) * (1/333.15 K - 1/T2)\n\nSolving for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/333.15 K + ln(2/5) * (0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K) / 22.49 L*atm/mol)\n1/T2 ≈ 0.003002 K^(-1)\nT2 ≈ 333.02 K\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the percentage of molecules in the vapor phase:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nAt the given temperature (T2), the vapor pressure is 2 atm. We can assume that the total pressure is also 2 atm. Therefore, the mole fraction of the vapor phase (Xvapor) is:\n\nXvapor = (n_vapor * R * T2) / (P * V)\n\nSince the substance behaves ideally, the mole fraction of the vapor phase is equal to the ratio of the vapor pressure to the total pressure:\n\nXvapor = P_vapor / P_total = 2 atm / 2 atm = 1\n\nSo, 100% of the molecules are present in the vapor phase at the given temperature and vapor pressure."
