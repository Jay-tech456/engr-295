    "message_1": "A straight wire of length 10 cm and resistance 2 ohm carries a current of 0.2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the wire, 5 cm away from the wire?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the current I = 0.2 A and the distance r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since we don't have information about the orientation of the wire, we can only say that the magnetic field will be circular around the wire, perpendicular to the wire's axis."
