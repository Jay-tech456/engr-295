    "message_2": "The gravitational pull of a black hole affects the orbits of nearby stars and planets in several ways. Due to its immense mass and gravitational force, a black hole can cause nearby celestial objects to follow highly elliptical or even chaotic orbits. The closer an object is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational influence and the more extreme the orbital effects.\n\nThere are several observable phenomena that can be used to study the effects of a black hole on nearby stars and planets:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: The strong gravitational field of a black hole can bend light from distant stars and galaxies, causing them to appear distorted or magnified. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to study the mass and location of a black hole.\n\n2. Accretion disk: As a black hole attracts nearby matter, it forms an accretion disk around itself. The matter in the disk becomes superheated and emits X-rays and other forms of radiation, which can be detected by telescopes. By studying the properties of the accretion disk, such as its temperature and luminosity, astronomers can infer information about the black hole's mass and size.\n\n3. Orbital motion of stars: The motion of stars near a black hole can be used to study its gravitational effects. For example, the star S2, which orbits the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, has been observed to follow a highly elliptical orbit with a period of about 16 years. By carefully tracking the motion of such stars, astronomers can determine the mass and location of the black hole.\n\n4. Tidal disruption events: Occasionally, a star may pass too close to a black hole and be torn apart by its tidal forces. The debris from the disrupted star forms an accretion disk around the black hole, which emits a bright flare of radiation that can be observed by telescopes. These events provide valuable information about the black hole's mass and the strength of its gravitational pull.\n\n5. Gravitational waves: When two black holes merge or a black hole captures a neutron star, they can emit gravitational waves â€“ ripples in spacetime that propagate through the universe. The detection of these waves can provide information about the masses and properties of the black holes involved in the event, as well as their effects on nearby celestial objects."
