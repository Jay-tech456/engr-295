    "message_2": "The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (g-2) is a measure of the deviation of the magnetic moment of the muon from its classical value. It arises due to quantum fluctuations and interactions with virtual particles in the vacuum. The total anomalous magnetic moment can be divided into several contributions: QED (quantum electrodynamics), weak, and hadronic.\n\nThe hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is the most challenging to calculate and measure experimentally. It arises from the interactions of the muon with virtual hadrons (particles composed of quarks and gluons) in the vacuum. The hadronic contribution is further divided into two parts: hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL).\n\nThe most accurate way to determine the hadronic contribution is through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Experimental measurements involve analyzing electron-positron annihilation data and using dispersion relations to relate these measurements to the hadronic contribution. Theoretical calculations involve lattice QCD (quantum chromodynamics), a numerical method that simulates the strong interaction on a discrete spacetime lattice.\n\nThe accuracy of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is limited by both experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Currently, the experimental uncertainty is dominated by the statistical and systematic errors in the electron-positron annihilation data. The theoretical uncertainty is mainly due to the limited precision of lattice QCD calculations and the difficulty in estimating the contributions from higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion.\n\nRecent progress in both experimental and theoretical techniques has led to significant improvements in the accuracy of the hadronic contribution. For example, the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with a precision of 140 parts per billion (ppb), which would be a fourfold improvement over previous measurements. Lattice QCD calculations have also been steadily improving, with some recent results reaching a precision of around 1% for the HVP contribution.\n\nIn summary, the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is a complex and challenging quantity to determine. It can be measured using precise measurements of the strong interaction in high-energy physics, with the current accuracy being limited by both experimental and theoretical uncertainties. However, ongoing efforts in both areas are expected to lead to significant improvements in the precision of the hadronic contribution in the coming years."
