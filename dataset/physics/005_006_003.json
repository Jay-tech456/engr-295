    "message_1": "A star located at a certain distance from the Earth emits light of a specific wavelength. If the star's gravitational field causes the light to shift to a longer wavelength, what is the difference in the wavelength of the emitted light compared to the received light on Earth? Assume the gravitational potential at the star's surface is known, and that the star is a non-rotating, spherically symmetric body. Calculate the ratio of emitted and received wavelengths of light in terms of the gravitational potential.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the ratio of emitted and received wavelengths of light in terms of the gravitational potential, we can use the gravitational redshift formula, which is derived from the general theory of relativity. The formula is:\n\n(1 + z) = λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt((1 + 2 * Φ_star) / (1 + 2 * Φ_earth))\n\nHere, z is the redshift, λ_observed is the wavelength of the received light on Earth, λ_emitted is the wavelength of the emitted light at the star's surface, Φ_star is the gravitational potential at the star's surface, and Φ_earth is the gravitational potential at the Earth's surface.\n\nSince the Earth's gravitational potential is much smaller than the star's gravitational potential, we can approximate Φ_earth ≈ 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\n(1 + z) = λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt(1 + 2 * Φ_star)\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of emitted and received wavelengths:\n\nλ_emitted / λ_observed = 1 / (1 + z) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 2 * Φ_star)\n\nThis is the ratio of emitted and received wavelengths of light in terms of the gravitational potential."
