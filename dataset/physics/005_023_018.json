    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a black hole is the radius of the event horizon, which is the boundary around the black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. The formula to calculate the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the black hole in kilograms is:\n\nM = 10^8 solar masses × 1.989 × 10^30 kg/solar mass = 1.989 × 10^38 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.989 × 10^38 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ (1.328 × 10^28 m^2 kg s^-2) / (9.0 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nRs ≈ 1.476 × 10^11 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of this supermassive black hole is approximately 1.476 × 10^11 meters."
