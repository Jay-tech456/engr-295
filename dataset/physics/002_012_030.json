    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula for work done in an isothermal process for an ideal gas:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven:\nn = 2 moles\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\nT = 300 K\nVi = 5 L\nVf = 8 L\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volumes from liters to cubic meters:\n\n1 L = 0.001 m³\nVi = 5 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.005 m³\nVf = 8 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.008 m³\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = (2 moles) * (8.314 J/(mol*K)) * (300 K) * ln(0.008 m³ / 0.005 m³)\n\nW = 16.628 J/K * 300 K * ln(1.6)\n\nW ≈ 4988.4 J * 0.4700\n\nW ≈ 2343.54 J\n\nThe work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 2343.54 J."
