    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect, we can use the formula for time dilation in a moving frame of reference, which is given by:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time interval measured on Earth (the time we want to find),\nΔt0 is the time interval measured on the spaceship (100 days),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.95c),\nc is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's convert 100 days to seconds, as it's more convenient for calculations:\n\n1 day = 24 hours = 24 * 60 * 60 seconds\n100 days = 100 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 8,640,000 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔt = 8,640,000 / √(1 - (0.95c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt = 8,640,000 / √(1 - 0.95^2)\n\nΔt = 8,640,000 / √(1 - 0.9025)\n\nΔt = 8,640,000 / √(0.0975)\n\nΔt ≈ 8,640,000 / 0.312\n\nΔt ≈ 27,692,308 seconds\n\nNow, let's convert the result back to days:\n\n27,692,308 seconds = 27,692,308 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 320.3 days\n\nSo, when the clock on the spaceship reads 100 days, approximately 320.3 days have passed on Earth due to the time dilation effect."
