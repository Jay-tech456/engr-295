    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy levels of electrons in an atom and the wavelengths of X-ray photons absorbed or emitted by the atom is described by the Bohr model of the atom and the Planck-Einstein relation. According to the Bohr model, electrons in an atom occupy discrete energy levels, and they can transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting photons. The energy of the photon (E) is related to its wavelength (λ) through the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nWhen an electron in an atom absorbs a photon with energy equal to the difference between two energy levels, it can jump to a higher energy level. Conversely, when an electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference between the two levels. For X-ray photons, these energy transitions typically involve the innermost electron shells (K and L shells) of the atom.\n\nThe unique X-ray absorption and emission spectra of different atomic elements are a result of the specific energy level differences in each element. Each element has a distinct set of energy levels, which leads to unique patterns of photon absorption and emission. By analyzing these patterns, scientists can identify the elements present in a sample and study their properties.\n\nX-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), are widely used to study the composition and structure of materials, as well as to investigate chemical and physical processes in various fields, including chemistry, materials science, geology, and environmental science."
