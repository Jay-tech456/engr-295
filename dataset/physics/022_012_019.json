    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters and superclusters in the universe. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect light. However, it does interact through gravity, and its presence can be inferred by observing its gravitational effects on visible matter.\n\nDark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (which forms stars, planets, and other visible structures) accounts for only about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nThe influence of dark matter on the formation of large-scale structures can be summarized in the following points:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides additional gravitational force that attracts ordinary matter, helping it to clump together and form structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Without dark matter, the gravitational pull from ordinary matter alone might not be strong enough to overcome the expansion of the universe and form these structures.\n\n2. Cosmic web: Dark matter is believed to form a cosmic web-like structure throughout the universe, with dense regions connected by filaments of dark matter. This web acts as a scaffold for the formation of large-scale structures, as ordinary matter follows the distribution of dark matter and accumulates in the densest regions.\n\n3. Stability of structures: Dark matter contributes to the overall mass of galaxy clusters and superclusters, providing additional gravitational force that helps to hold these structures together. This prevents them from being torn apart by their own rotation or by tidal forces from nearby structures.\n\nThere are several observable effects of dark matter that can help us better understand its distribution and properties within large-scale structures:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: The presence of dark matter can bend the path of light from distant objects due to its gravitational influence. By studying the distorted images of these objects, astronomers can map the distribution of dark matter within galaxy clusters and infer its properties.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation speeds of stars and gas in galaxies can be used to estimate the distribution of mass within the galaxy. Observations show that the rotation curves remain flat or even increase with distance from the galactic center, indicating the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. The distribution of dark matter in the early universe affects the pattern of temperature fluctuations in the CMB. By studying these patterns, cosmologists can learn about the properties and distribution of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure distribution: The distribution of galaxy clusters and superclusters in the universe can provide information about the underlying dark matter distribution. By analyzing the clustering of these structures, researchers can infer the properties of dark matter and its role in the formation of large-scale structures.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter plays a vital role in the formation and stability of large-scale structures in the universe. Observations of gravitational lensing, galaxy rotation curves, the CMB, and the distribution of large-scale structures can help us better understand the properties and distribution of dark matter within these structures."
