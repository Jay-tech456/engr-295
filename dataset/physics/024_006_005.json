    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = 1 - a * x_n^2 + y_n\ny_n+1 = b * x_n\n\nwhere (x_n, y_n) are the coordinates of the system at time n, and a and b are the bifurcation parameters.\n\nThe transition from a period-2 attractor to a chaotic attractor occurs when the bifurcation parameter a reaches a critical value. For the Hénon map, this critical value is approximately a ≈ 1.4 when b = 0.3. However, the exact value may vary depending on the specific system and parameter values being considered."
