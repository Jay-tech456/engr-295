    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the chirp mass formula and the inspiral phase frequency. The chirp mass (M_c) is a combination of the individual masses (m1 and m2) of the neutron stars:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^3/5 / (m1 + m2)^1/5\n\nSince the total mass (M) of the system is given as 2.7 times the mass of the sun (M_sun), we can write:\n\nM = m1 + m2 = 2.7 * M_sun\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's assume that both neutron stars have equal masses, so m1 = m2 = 1.35 * M_sun. Now we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_c = ((1.35 * M_sun) * (1.35 * M_sun))^3/5 / (2.7 * M_sun)^1/5\n\nNow, we can use the chirp mass to estimate the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase. The formula for the frequency (f) is:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96 * π^(-8/3) * M_c^(-5/3) * (dE/dt)^(-3/5))\n\nHere, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and dE/dt is the rate of change of the energy of the system. For neutron star mergers, the energy loss is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves, so we can approximate dE/dt as:\n\ndE/dt ≈ - (32/5) * G^4 / c^5 * (m1 * m2)^2 * (m1 + m2) / r^5\n\nHere, r is the separation between the neutron stars. As the neutron stars inspiral, the separation decreases, and the frequency of the gravitational waves increases. The frequency will be highest just before the merger, when the separation is smallest. For simplicity, let's assume that the separation is roughly equal to the sum of the neutron star radii, which is about 20 kilometers (20,000 meters).\n\nNow we can plug in the values and calculate the frequency:\n\ndE/dt ≈ - (32/5) * G^4 / c^5 * (1.35 * M_sun)^2 * (2.7 * M_sun) / (20,000 m)^5\n\nf ≈ (c^3 / G) * (5/96 * π^(-8/3) * M_c^(-5/3) * (dE/dt)^(-3/5))\n\nAfter plugging in the values for c, G, M_sun, and the calculated values for M_c and dE/dt, we can solve for the frequency f. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency will depend on the specific properties of the neutron star merger.\n\nf ≈ 1500 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger is approximately 1500 Hz, just before the merger."
