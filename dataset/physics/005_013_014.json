If the velocity of each particle is 0.5c, where c is the speed of light, what is the total energy released in the collision?",
    "message_2": "To find the total energy released in the collision, we first need to find the energy of each particle after the collision and then subtract the initial energy of the system.\n\nThe energy of a particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nSince the particles have equal but opposite momenta after the collision, we can find the energy of one particle and then multiply by 2 to find the total energy.\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic mass of the particle moving at 0.5c using the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.75)\nγ ≈ 1.155\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = γ * m\nm_rel ≈ 1.155 * 10 kg\nm_rel ≈ 11.55 kg\n\nNow, we can find the momentum of the particle:\n\np = m_rel * v\np ≈ 11.55 kg * 0.5c\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the particle using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\nE^2 = (10 kg * c^2)^2 + (11.55 kg * c)^2\nE ≈ sqrt((10 kg * c^2)^2 + (11.55 kg * c)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of both particles after the collision:\n\nE_total_after = 2 * E\n\nThe initial energy of the system is just the rest energy of the 10 kg particle:\n\nE_initial = mc^2\nE_initial = 10 kg * c^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total energy released in the collision:\n\nEnergy_released = E_total_after - E_initial\nEnergy_released ≈ 2 * sqrt((10 kg * c^2)^2 + (11.55 kg * c)^2) - 10 kg * c^2"
