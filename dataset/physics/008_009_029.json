    "message_2": "The Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition refers to the change in the state of matter in the early universe, from a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to a hadronic phase, where quarks and gluons combined to form hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other particles). This transition is believed to have occurred around a few microseconds after the Big Bang when the universe cooled down sufficiently for quarks and gluons to be confined within hadrons. There are several key observations and predictions that support this theory, as well as experimental evidence gathered from high-energy particle collisions.\n\nKey observations and predictions:\n\n1. Temperature and energy density: The QCD phase transition is expected to occur at a critical temperature of around 150-170 MeV (million electron volts) and an energy density of around 1 GeV/fm³ (giga-electron volts per cubic femtometer). These conditions are predicted by lattice QCD calculations, which are numerical simulations of QCD on a discrete spacetime lattice.\n\n2. Chiral symmetry restoration: In the high-temperature QGP phase, chiral symmetry is expected to be restored, meaning that left-handed and right-handed quarks become indistinguishable. This symmetry is broken in the low-temperature hadronic phase, giving rise to the masses of hadrons. The restoration of chiral symmetry is a key prediction of the QCD phase transition.\n\n3. Deconfinement: In the QGP phase, quarks and gluons are deconfined, meaning they can move freely over large distances. In the hadronic phase, they are confined within hadrons due to the strong force. The transition between these two phases is another key aspect of the QCD phase transition.\n\nExperimental evidence:\n\n1. Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC): Experiments at these high-energy particle colliders have provided strong evidence for the formation of a QGP in heavy-ion collisions. By smashing heavy ions like gold or lead at nearly the speed of light, these experiments create conditions similar to those in the early universe, allowing the study of the QCD phase transition. Observations such as the suppression of high-energy particle production (jet quenching) and the collective flow of particles (elliptic flow) are consistent with the formation of a strongly interacting QGP.\n\n2. Quarkonium suppression: The suppression of quarkonium states (bound states of heavy quarks and antiquarks, like J/ψ and Υ) in heavy-ion collisions is another piece of evidence for the QCD phase transition. This suppression is expected due to the screening of the strong force between quarks in the QGP, making it difficult for quarkonium states to survive.\n\n3. Fluctuations and correlations: The study of fluctuations and correlations in particle production can provide information about the critical point and the nature of the QCD phase transition. For example, fluctuations in conserved quantities like baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness can signal the approach to the critical point.\n\nIn summary, the theory of a QCD phase transition in the early universe is supported by key observations and predictions from lattice QCD calculations and experimental evidence from high-energy particle collisions. These experiments have provided strong evidence for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma and the associated phenomena, such as chiral symmetry restoration, deconfinement, and quarkonium suppression."
