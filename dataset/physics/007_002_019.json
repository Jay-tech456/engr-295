    "message_2": "To calculate the remaining mass of the radium-226 sample, we can use the formula:\n\nremaining mass = initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nwhere\ninitial mass = 25 grams\ntime elapsed = 800 years\nhalf-life = 1600 years\n\nremaining mass = 25 * (1/2)^(800 / 1600)\nremaining mass = 25 * (1/2)^0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate (1/2)^0.5:\n(1/2)^0.5 ≈ 0.7071\n\nSo, the remaining mass is:\nremaining mass = 25 * 0.7071 ≈ 17.68 grams\n\nAfter 800 years, the remaining mass of the radium-226 sample is approximately 17.68 grams."
