    "message_2": "In quantum cryptography, the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted securely through a single photon is determined by the number of orthogonal quantum states that can be prepared and measured. This is because each orthogonal state can be used to represent a unique piece of information. The most common quantum cryptography protocol, BB84, uses four orthogonal states (two bases with two states each) to encode one bit of information per photon.\n\nHowever, it is possible to use more orthogonal states to encode more information per photon. For example, if we use d orthogonal states (also known as a d-dimensional quantum system or qudit), we can encode log2(d) bits of information per photon. The factors that determine this limit include the ability to prepare and measure these orthogonal states accurately and the noise in the quantum channel.\n\nIn practice, the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted securely through a single photon is limited by the physical properties of the photon and the experimental setup. For example, using the polarization of a photon, we can have two orthogonal states (horizontal and vertical polarization) to encode one bit of information. If we use the orbital angular momentum of a photon, we can have more orthogonal states, potentially encoding more bits of information per photon.\n\nHowever, increasing the number of orthogonal states also increases the complexity of the experimental setup and the probability of errors. Moreover, the security of quantum cryptography relies on the no-cloning theorem, which states that an unknown quantum state cannot be copied perfectly. As the number of orthogonal states increases, the ability to distinguish between them decreases, making it easier for an eavesdropper to gain information without being detected.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted securely through a single photon using quantum cryptography depends on the number of orthogonal quantum states that can be prepared and measured accurately. In practice, this limit is determined by the physical properties of the photon and the experimental setup, with a trade-off between the amount of information encoded per photon and the complexity and error rates of the system."
