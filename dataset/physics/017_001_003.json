    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of graphene is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties are those that are inherent to the material, while extrinsic properties are those that depend on external factors, such as impurities or defects.\n\nIntrinsic properties affecting electrical conductivity of graphene:\n\n1. Band structure: Graphene has a unique band structure with a zero bandgap, which leads to its high electrical conductivity. The linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points results in massless Dirac fermions, which contribute to the high carrier mobility in graphene.\n\n2. Temperature: The electrical conductivity of graphene is influenced by temperature. At low temperatures, the conductivity is dominated by electron-electron interactions, while at higher temperatures, it is dominated by electron-phonon interactions. As temperature increases, the conductivity decreases due to increased scattering of charge carriers by lattice vibrations (phonons).\n\nExtrinsic properties affecting electrical conductivity of graphene:\n\n1. Defects and impurities: The presence of defects, such as vacancies or dislocations, and impurities, such as dopants or adsorbed atoms, can significantly affect the electrical conductivity of graphene. These defects and impurities can act as scattering centers for charge carriers, reducing their mobility and, consequently, the conductivity.\n\n2. Strain: Mechanical strain can modify the band structure of graphene, leading to changes in its electrical conductivity. Strain can either increase or decrease the conductivity, depending on the direction and magnitude of the applied strain.\n\n3. Substrate interactions: The interaction between graphene and its substrate can also influence its electrical conductivity. For example, the substrate can induce charge transfer or strain in the graphene layer, affecting its electronic properties.\n\n4. External electric or magnetic fields: The application of external electric or magnetic fields can modify the electronic properties of graphene, leading to changes in its electrical conductivity.\n\nThe influence of these properties on the electronic transport properties of graphene can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. High carrier mobility: The unique band structure and low defect density in pristine graphene result in high carrier mobility, which contributes to its high electrical conductivity.\n\n2. Tunable conductivity: The electrical conductivity of graphene can be tuned by modifying its extrinsic properties, such as doping, strain, or external fields. This tunability makes graphene a promising material for various electronic applications.\n\n3. Temperature dependence: The temperature-dependent conductivity of graphene, with a decrease in conductivity at higher temperatures, can be exploited for applications such as temperature sensors or thermoelectric devices.\n\n4. Sensitivity to external factors: The electrical conductivity of graphene is sensitive to external factors, such as defects, impurities, or substrate interactions. This sensitivity can be utilized in the development of sensors for detecting various chemical or physical changes in the environment."
