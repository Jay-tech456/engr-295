    "message_1": "A radiation detector is exposed to a source of nuclear radiation with an activity of 5000 Bq. If the detector records an average count rate of 1000 counts per minute, determine the efficiency of the detector.",
    "message_2": "To determine the efficiency of the radiation detector, we need to compare the activity of the source (in Becquerels, Bq) with the count rate recorded by the detector (in counts per minute, cpm).\n\nFirst, let's convert the activity of the source to counts per minute:\nActivity = 5000 Bq = 5000 disintegrations per second\n\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the activity to disintegrations per minute:\nActivity = 5000 disintegrations/second * 60 seconds/minute = 300,000 disintegrations/minute\n\nNow, we can calculate the efficiency of the detector by dividing the count rate recorded by the detector by the activity of the source (both in counts per minute):\nEfficiency = (Count rate recorded by detector) / (Activity of the source)\nEfficiency = (1000 counts/minute) / (300,000 disintegrations/minute)\n\nEfficiency = 0.003333\n\nTo express the efficiency as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nEfficiency = 0.003333 * 100 = 0.3333%\n\nThe efficiency of the radiation detector is approximately 0.3333%."
