    "message_1": "A physics student is performing an experiment on Snell's Law using a piece of glass with an index of refraction of 1.50. When a ray of light enters the glass from air at an angle of incidence of 30 degrees, it is refracted at an angle of 19.47 degrees. What is the angle of refraction for the same ray of light if it enters the glass at an angle of incidence of 60 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for the two media (air and glass in this case), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nWe are given that the index of refraction for air (n1) is approximately 1.00, and the index of refraction for the glass (n2) is 1.50. We are also given that when the angle of incidence (θ1) is 30 degrees, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 19.47 degrees. We can use this information to find the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction:\n\n1.00 * sin(30) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\nsin(30) = 1.50 * sin(19.47)\n\nNow, we want to find the angle of refraction (θ2) when the angle of incidence (θ1) is 60 degrees:\n\n1.00 * sin(60) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nTo solve for θ2, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(θ2) = (1.00/1.50) * sin(60)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = (2/3) * sin(60)\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ2 by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.577:\n\nθ2 ≈ arcsin(0.577)\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction for the same ray of light when it enters the glass at an angle of incidence of 60 degrees is approximately 35.3 degrees."
