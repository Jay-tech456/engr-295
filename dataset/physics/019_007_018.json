    "message_2": "The Casimir force between two parallel metallic plates can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nF_Casimir = (π² * ħ * c * A) / (480 * d³)\n\nwhere:\nF_Casimir is the Casimir force,\nħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s),\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s),\nA is the surface area of the plates (1 m² in this case),\nd is the distance between the plates (10 micrometers or 10 × 10⁻⁶ m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nF_Casimir = (π² * 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s * 1 m²) / (480 * (10 × 10⁻⁶ m)³)\n\nF_Casimir = (9.869604 * 1.0545718 × 10⁻²⁶ J·m/s) / (480 * 10⁻¹⁸ m³)\n\nF_Casimir = (1.039 × 10⁻²⁶ J·m/s) / (480 × 10⁻¹⁸ m³)\n\nF_Casimir ≈ 2.17 × 10⁻⁹ N\n\nSo, the Casimir force between the two parallel metallic plates is approximately 2.17 × 10⁻⁹ N (Newtons)."
