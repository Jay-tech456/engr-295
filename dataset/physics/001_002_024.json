    "message_2": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the momentum of the electron (1 x 10^-25 kg m/s) and asked to find the minimum uncertainty in its position (Δx). We can rearrange the Heisenberg uncertainty principle equation to solve for Δx:\n\nΔx ≥ ħ / (2 * Δp)\n\nWe are given Δp = 1 x 10^-25 kg m/s. Now we can plug in the values:\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1 x 10^-25 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 x 10^-25 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ 5.272859 x 10^-35 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 5.27 x 10^-35 meters."
