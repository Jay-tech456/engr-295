    "message_2": "To estimate the nuclear radius of a Boron-10 nucleus, we can use the empirical formula for the nuclear radius, which is given by:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the nuclear radius, R₀ is a constant (approximately 1.2 x 10^(-15) meters), and A is the mass number of the nucleus (number of protons and neutrons).\n\nFor Boron-10, the mass number A = 10 (5 protons and 5 neutrons). Plugging this value into the formula:\n\nR = (1.2 x 10^(-15) m) * (10^(1/3))\nR ≈ (1.2 x 10^(-15) m) * (2.154)\n\nR ≈ 2.585 x 10^(-15) meters\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of a Boron-10 nucleus is approximately 2.585 x 10^(-15) meters."
