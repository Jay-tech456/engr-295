    "message_1": "What is the change in vapor pressure of water when it is heated from 25°C to 50°C, assuming the enthalpy of vaporization of water remains constant at 40.7 kJ/mol and the molar volume of liquid water is negligible compared to that of steam? (Use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve the problem)",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given:\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\nT1 = 25°C = 298.15 K\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K\n\nWe need to find the change in vapor pressure, which is (P2 - P1). To do this, we first need to find the ratio P2/P1 using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value inside the parentheses:\n\n1/323.15 K - 1/298.15 K = -0.000025 K^(-1)\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (-0.000025 K^(-1))\nln(P2/P1) ≈ 0.123\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides of the equation to get the ratio P2/P1:\n\nP2/P1 = e^(0.123) ≈ 1.131\n\nWe don't have the actual values of P1 and P2, but we know their ratio and that the vapor pressure increases as the temperature increases. Therefore, the change in vapor pressure is:\n\nΔP = P2 - P1 = P1 * (1.131 - 1)\n\nSince we don't have the actual value of P1, we can't find the exact value of ΔP. However, we can say that the vapor pressure at 50°C is approximately 1.131 times the vapor pressure at 25°C."
