    "message_2": "The current best estimate of the contribution of dark energy to the total energy budget of the universe comes from the Planck satellite's measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, combined with observations of distant supernovae and other cosmological data. According to the latest results from the Planck collaboration (2018), dark energy accounts for approximately 68.3% of the total energy content of the universe. This value is derived from the ΛCDM model, which is the standard model of cosmology and describes the universe as consisting of dark energy (Λ), cold dark matter (CDM), and ordinary matter (baryonic matter).\n\nThe contribution of dark energy to the total energy budget of the universe has changed over time. In the early universe, dark energy played a negligible role, as the universe was dominated by radiation and matter (both dark and baryonic). As the universe expanded, the density of matter and radiation decreased, while the density of dark energy remained relatively constant. This led to dark energy becoming the dominant component in the energy budget of the universe.\n\nObservations of distant supernovae, specifically Type Ia supernovae, have provided crucial evidence for the existence of dark energy and its role in the accelerating expansion of the universe. In 1998, two independent teams of astronomers discovered that distant Type Ia supernovae were fainter than expected, implying that they were farther away than anticipated. This observation suggested that the expansion of the universe was not slowing down, as was previously thought, but was instead accelerating. This acceleration could only be explained by the presence of a previously unknown form of energy, which came to be known as dark energy.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang, also provides strong evidence for the existence of dark energy. The CMB contains tiny temperature fluctuations that reveal information about the composition and evolution of the universe. By analyzing these fluctuations, scientists have been able to determine the relative contributions of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter to the total energy budget of the universe. The Planck satellite's precise measurements of the CMB have provided the most accurate estimates of these contributions to date.\n\nIn conclusion, the current best estimate of the contribution of dark energy to the total energy budget of the universe is approximately 68.3%, based on the latest results from the Planck collaboration. This contribution has increased over time, as the universe has expanded and the density of matter and radiation has decreased. Observations of distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation have provided crucial evidence supporting the existence of dark energy and its role in the accelerating expansion of the universe."
