    "message_2": "According to the theory of Relativistic Cosmology, the age of the universe can be estimated using the Hubble constant (H₀), which is a measure of the rate of expansion of the universe. The current estimate of the Hubble constant is about 67.4 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec) as per the Planck mission results.\n\nAssuming a flat universe, we can use the Hubble constant to estimate the age of the universe using the following formula:\n\nAge of the universe = 1 / H₀\n\nHowever, we need to convert the Hubble constant into the appropriate units of inverse time (1/seconds) before using it in the formula. To do this, we'll use the conversion factors:\n\n1 Mpc = 3.086 × 10^19 km\n1 km = 10^3 m\n1 s = 3.154 × 10^7 yr (seconds per year)\n\nFirst, convert the Hubble constant from km/s/Mpc to m/s/Mpc:\n\n67.4 km/s/Mpc × (10^3 m/km) = 67.4 × 10^3 m/s/Mpc\n\nNow, convert from m/s/Mpc to 1/s:\n\n(67.4 × 10^3 m/s/Mpc) × (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 m) = 2.182 × 10^-18 1/s\n\nFinally, calculate the age of the universe:\n\nAge of the universe = 1 / H₀ = 1 / (2.182 × 10^-18 1/s)\n\nAge of the universe ≈ 4.58 × 10^17 s\n\nNow, convert the age of the universe from seconds to years:\n\nAge of the universe ≈ (4.58 × 10^17 s) × (1 yr / 3.154 × 10^7 s) ≈ 14.5 billion years\n\nSo, according to the theory of Relativistic Cosmology and the current estimate of the Hubble constant, the age of the universe is approximately 14.5 billion years, assuming a flat universe."
