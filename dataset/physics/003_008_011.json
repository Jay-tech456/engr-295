    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law for a current-carrying sheet. The magnetic field due to a small segment of the sheet can be calculated and then integrated over the entire sheet.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law for a small segment of the sheet carrying current dI is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * ds) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dI is the current in the small segment, ds is the length of the small segment, and r is the distance from the segment to point P.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed across the sheet, we can calculate the current per unit length (I/L) along the x-direction:\n\nI/L = 5 A / 0.4 m = 12.5 A/m\n\nNow, let's consider a small segment of length dx at a distance x from the left edge of the sheet. The current in this segment is dI = (I/L) * dx = 12.5 * dx A.\n\nThe distance from this segment to point P is given by:\n\nr = sqrt((0.3 m)² + x²)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 12.5 * dx) / (4 * π * (0.3 m)² + x²)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate this expression over the entire length of the sheet (from x = 0 to x = 0.4 m):\n\nB = ∫(4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 12.5 * dx) / (4 * π * (0.3 m)² + x²) from 0 to 0.4\n\nB = (12.5 * 10^(-7) Tm) * ∫(dx) / ((0.3 m)² + x²) from 0 to 0.4\n\nThis integral can be solved using the arctangent function:\n\nB = (12.5 * 10^(-7) Tm) * [arctan(x / 0.3 m)] from 0 to 0.4\n\nB = (12.5 * 10^(-7) Tm) * (arctan(0.4 / 0.3) - arctan(0))\n\nB ≈ (12.5 * 10^(-7) Tm) * 0.93\n\nB ≈ 1.16 * 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.16 μT."
