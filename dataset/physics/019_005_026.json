    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, an electron cannot decay into a neutrino and a photon directly. This is because the electron, being a charged lepton, cannot decay into a neutrino (which is a neutral lepton) and a photon (which is a massless boson) while conserving both energy and momentum, as well as other conservation laws such as electric charge and lepton number.\n\nHowever, you mentioned a scalar quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory, which is a hypothetical scenario that deviates from the Standard Model. In this case, we would need more information about the specific scalar QED theory and its interaction terms to calculate the decay rate of the electron into a neutrino and a photon.\n\nIn general, the decay rate of a particle can be calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule, which states that the decay rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element describing the decay process and the density of final states. The matrix element depends on the specific interaction terms in the scalar QED theory, while the density of final states can be calculated using phase space integrals.\n\nWithout more information about the specific scalar QED theory, it is not possible to provide a numerical value for the decay rate of an electron into a neutrino and a photon."
