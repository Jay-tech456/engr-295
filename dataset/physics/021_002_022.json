    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass of 1 million solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 1,000,000 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^36 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (1.989 × 10^36 kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.95 × 10^9 meters\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is approximately 2.95 × 10^9 meters.\n\nThe event horizon of a black hole is essentially the same as its Schwarzschild radius. It is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. In this case, the size of the event horizon is also approximately 2.95 × 10^9 meters."
