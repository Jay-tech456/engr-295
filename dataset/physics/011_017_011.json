    "message_2": "The ferroelectric phase transition temperature, also known as the Curie temperature (Tc), is the temperature at which a ferroelectric material transitions from a paraelectric phase to a ferroelectric phase. In a crystal system with both spontaneous polarization and anisotropic thermal expansion, the application of an external electric field can have a significant impact on the phase transition temperature.\n\nThe variation of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature with an external electric field can be understood through the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. According to this theory, the free energy of a ferroelectric material can be expressed as a function of polarization and temperature. The phase transition occurs when the free energy is minimized.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied, the free energy of the system is modified due to the interaction between the electric field and the spontaneous polarization. This interaction can either stabilize or destabilize the ferroelectric phase, depending on the direction and magnitude of the applied field.\n\nIn general, the application of an external electric field can lead to the following effects on the ferroelectric phase transition temperature:\n\n1. Increase in Tc: If the applied electric field is parallel to the spontaneous polarization direction, it can stabilize the ferroelectric phase and increase the phase transition temperature. This is known as the positive electrocaloric effect.\n\n2. Decrease in Tc: If the applied electric field is antiparallel to the spontaneous polarization direction, it can destabilize the ferroelectric phase and decrease the phase transition temperature. This is known as the negative electrocaloric effect.\n\n3. No change in Tc: If the applied electric field is perpendicular to the spontaneous polarization direction, it may not have a significant effect on the phase transition temperature.\n\nThe exact variation of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature with the applied electric field depends on the specific material properties, such as the strength of the spontaneous polarization, the anisotropy of the thermal expansion, and the dielectric properties of the material. To determine the precise relationship between the applied electric field and the phase transition temperature, one would need to perform detailed calculations or experiments on the specific crystal system of interest."
