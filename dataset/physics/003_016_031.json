    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the given point, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the triangle has sides of length 5 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm, it is a right-angled triangle (Pythagorean triple: 5² + 8² = 10²). Let's label the vertices A, B, and C, with A being the vertex opposite the shortest side (5 cm), B being the vertex opposite the 8 cm side, and C being the vertex opposite the 10 cm side. The point P is 2 cm away from vertex A on the perpendicular bisector of side BC.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coordinates of point P. Since P is on the perpendicular bisector of side BC, it is equidistant from B and C. Let's place the triangle in the xy-plane with vertex B at the origin (0, 0), vertex C at (5, 0), and vertex A at (0, 8). Then, the midpoint of side BC is at (2.5, 0), and the distance from P to BC is 2 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the y-coordinate of P:\n\n2² = (2.5 - x)² + y²\n4 = 6.25 - 5x + x² + y²\ny² = 5x - 2.25\n\nSince P is equidistant from B and C, we can also write:\n\n(5 - x)² + y² = x² + y²\n25 - 10x + x² = x²\nx = 2.5\n\nSubstituting x back into the equation for y²:\n\ny² = 5(2.5) - 2.25\ny² = 10.25\ny = ±√10.25 ≈ ±3.2\n\nSince point P is above the x-axis, we choose the positive value for y:\n\nP ≈ (2.5, 3.2)\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field at point P due to each side of the triangle using the Biot-Savart law. For a straight wire, the magnetic field is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * L) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire and d is the distance from the wire to the point.\n\nFor side AB:\n\nL = 8 cm = 0.08 m\nd = distance from P to AB = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nB_AB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.08 m) / (2 * π * 0.02 m) = 16 × 10^(-7) T\n\nFor side BC:\n\nL = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nd = distance from P to BC = 3.2 cm = 0.032 m\nB_BC = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.05 m) / (2 * π * 0.032 m) = 6.25 × 10^(-7) T\n\nFor side AC:\n\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nd = distance from P to AC = √((2.5 - 0)² + (3.2 - 8)²) ≈ 0.052 m\nB_AC = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.1 m) / (2 * π * 0.052 m) = 19.23 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we need to find the direction of the magnetic field due to each side. We can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field. For side AB, the magnetic field is into the plane (negative z-direction). For side BC, the magnetic field is out of the plane (positive z-direction). For side AC, the magnetic field is into the plane (negative z-direction).\n\nSince the magnetic fields due to sides AB and AC are in the same direction, we can add their magnitudes:\n\nB_A = B_AB + B_AC = 16 × 10^(-7) T + 19.23 × 10^(-7) T = 35.23 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe net magnetic field at point P is the difference between the magnetic fields due to sides A and BC:\n\nB_net = B_A - B_BC = 35.23 × 10^(-7) T - 6.25 × 10^(-7) T = 28.98 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 28.98 × 10^(-7) T, and the direction is into the plane (negative z-direction)."
