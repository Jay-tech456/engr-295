    "message_2": "To determine the period and amplitude of a gravitational wave signal detected by LIGO, we need the strain amplitude (h) and frequency (f) of the detected signal.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational wave signal is equal to the strain amplitude (h). So, the amplitude is:\n\nAmplitude = h\n\nThe period (T) of the gravitational wave signal is the inverse of the frequency (f). So, the period is:\n\nPeriod (T) = 1 / f\n\nGiven the strain amplitude (h) and frequency (f) of the detected signal, you can now calculate the period and amplitude of the gravitational wave signal."
