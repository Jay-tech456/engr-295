    "message_1": "A sample of hydrogen gas (H2) is subjected to Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The spectrometer produces a signal with a frequency of 42.58 MHz. What is the applied magnetic field strength for this measurement?",
    "message_2": "In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the frequency of the signal produced is related to the applied magnetic field strength (B0) through the Larmor equation:\n\nν = γ * B0 / (2 * π)\n\nwhere ν is the signal frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus being studied (in this case, hydrogen), and B0 is the applied magnetic field strength.\n\nFor hydrogen (1H), the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) is approximately 267.52 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1.\n\nGiven the signal frequency (ν) of 42.58 MHz, we can rearrange the Larmor equation to solve for the magnetic field strength (B0):\n\nB0 = (2 * π * ν) / γ\n\nFirst, we need to convert the frequency from MHz to Hz:\n\n42.58 MHz = 42.58 × 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for B0:\n\nB0 = (2 * π * 42.58 × 10^6 Hz) / (267.52 × 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1)\nB0 ≈ 1.0 T\n\nSo, the applied magnetic field strength for this measurement is approximately 1.0 Tesla."
