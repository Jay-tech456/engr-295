    "message_2": "To determine the relativistic energy of a free particle, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the relativistic momentum. The relativistic momentum is given by:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. Given the rest mass m = 2.5 kg and velocity v = 0.8c, we can first calculate the relativistic momentum:\n\np = (2.5 kg)(0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\np = 2.5 * 0.8c / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = 2.0c / sqrt(0.36)\np = 2.0c / 0.6\np = 10c/3\n\nNow we can plug the momentum back into the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\nE² = (2.5 kg * c²)² + ((10c/3) * c)²\nE² = (2.5² * c⁴) + (100/9 * c² * c²)\nE² = 6.25c⁴ + 100/9 * c⁴\n\nNow we can factor out the c⁴:\n\nE² = c⁴ * (6.25 + 100/9)\nE² = c⁴ * (56.25/9)\nE = c² * sqrt(56.25/9)\n\nFinally, we can take the square root to find the energy:\n\nE = c² * sqrt(56.25/9)\nE = c² * (7.5/3)\nE = 2.5c²\n\nSo the relativistic energy of the free particle is 2.5 times its rest energy, which is:\n\nE = 2.5 * 2.5 kg * c²\nE = 6.25 kg * c²\n\nThus, the relativistic energy of the free particle is 6.25 kg * c²."
