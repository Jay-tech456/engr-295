    "message_2": "The Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity that describes an expanding, homogeneous, and isotropic universe. In the context of the FLRW metric, the age of the universe can be determined by considering the Hubble parameter (H), the matter density (Ω_m), the cosmological constant (Ω_Λ), and the critical density (ρ_c).\n\nFor a flat universe with a critical density (Ω_total = 1), the age of the universe can be estimated using the following equation:\n\nt = (1/H) * ∫[0,1] (1/(Ω_m/a + Ω_Λ*a^2))^(1/2) da\n\nHere, 'a' is the scale factor, and 'H' is the Hubble constant. The current best estimates for these parameters are:\n\nH = 67.4 km/s/Mpc (Planck 2018 results)\nΩ_m = 0.315 (matter density)\nΩ_Λ = 0.685 (cosmological constant)\n\nBy solving the integral numerically, we find that the age of the universe according to the FLRW metric with a cosmological constant and critical density is approximately 13.8 billion years.\n\nThis age estimate is consistent with other age estimates of the universe, such as those derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, nucleosynthesis of light elements, and the ages of the oldest known stars. The Planck satellite mission, which measured the CMB, also provided an age estimate of 13.8 billion years for the universe, further supporting the result obtained from the FLRW metric."
