    "message_1": "A spaceship travels towards Earth at a speed of 0.75c. The ship emits a light beam at an angle of 30 degrees from its travel direction. What is the angle at which the beam appears to an observer on Earth due to Relativistic aberration of light?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic aberration formula:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) * sqrt(1 - v^2)) / (cos(θ) + v)\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the light beam relative to the spaceship's direction (30 degrees), θ' is the angle at which the beam appears to an observer on Earth, v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to the speed of light (0.75c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle θ from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(π / 6) * sqrt(1 - 0.75^2)) / (cos(π / 6) + 0.75)\n\ntan(θ') ≈ (0.5 * sqrt(1 - 0.5625)) / (0.866 + 0.75)\n\ntan(θ') ≈ (0.5 * sqrt(0.4375)) / 1.616\n\ntan(θ') ≈ 0.3281 / 1.616\n\ntan(θ') ≈ 0.2029\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ' by taking the arctangent of the result:\n\nθ' = arctan(0.2029)\n\nθ' ≈ 0.204 radians\n\nFinally, we can convert the angle θ' from radians to degrees:\n\nθ' ≈ 0.204 * (180 / π) ≈ 11.7 degrees\n\nSo, the angle at which the beam appears to an observer on Earth due to relativistic aberration of light is approximately 11.7 degrees."
