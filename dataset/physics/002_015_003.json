    "message_1": "A heat pump operates at a temperature difference of 30Â°C and has a power input of 2 kW. If the heat output of the heat pump is 8 kW, what is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is the ratio of the heat output to the power input. In this case, the heat output is 8 kW, and the power input is 2 kW. To find the COP, we can use the following formula:\n\nCOP = Heat Output / Power Input\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nCOP = 8 kW / 2 kW\n\nCOP = 4\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 4."
