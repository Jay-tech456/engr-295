    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the tube, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current flowing through the wire (3 A), and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nHowever, since the wire is wound around the cylindrical tube, we need to first determine the number of turns (N) of the wire around the tube.\n\nThe circumference of the tube is given by:\n\nC = 2 * π * R\n\nwhere R is the radius of the tube (0.04 m).\n\nC = 2 * π * 0.04 = 0.08π m\n\nNow, we can find the total length of the wire (L) which is 2 m. To find the number of turns, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of one turn (the circumference of the tube):\n\nN = L / C = 2 / (0.08π) ≈ 7.96 ≈ 8 turns (approximately)\n\nSince there are 8 turns of the wire, the total current enclosed by the 8 turns is:\n\nI_total = N * I = 8 * 3 = 24 A\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the tube, which is 10 cm (0.1 m) away from its center. The distance from the wire to the point is the sum of the radius of the tube and the distance from the center:\n\nr_total = R + 0.1 = 0.04 + 0.1 = 0.14 m\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_total) / (2 * π * r_total)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 24 A) / (2 * π * 0.14 m)\nB ≈ (3.0 × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.14 m\nB ≈ 2.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the point on the axis of the tube which is 10 cm away from its center is approximately 2.14 × 10^(-5) T."
