    "message_2": "The detectability of gravitational waves would differ significantly if a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) were present within a given distance compared to a population of only stellar-mass black holes (SMBHs). This is due to several factors, including the mass of the black holes, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves, and the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\n1. Mass: IMBHs have masses ranging from 100 to 100,000 solar masses, while SMBHs have masses ranging from a few to a few tens of solar masses. The amplitude of gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the merging objects. Therefore, the gravitational waves emitted by merging IMBHs would have a higher amplitude compared to those emitted by merging SMBHs. This would make the gravitational waves from IMBHs easier to detect.\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of the emitted gravitational waves depends on the masses of the merging objects and their orbital parameters. Merging IMBHs would emit gravitational waves at lower frequencies compared to merging SMBHs. This is because the orbital frequency of the binary system decreases as the mass of the objects increases. The frequency range of the emitted gravitational waves is crucial for their detectability, as different detectors are sensitive to different frequency ranges.\n\n3. Detector sensitivity: Current gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are most sensitive to frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to a few kHz. This frequency range is well-suited for detecting gravitational waves from merging SMBHs. However, the lower frequencies of gravitational waves emitted by merging IMBHs might fall below the sensitivity range of these detectors. To detect gravitational waves from IMBHs, we would need detectors that are sensitive to lower frequencies, such as the proposed space-based detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna).\n\nIn summary, the presence of a population of intermediate-mass black holes within a given distance would affect the detectability of gravitational waves in several ways. The higher amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by merging IMBHs would make them easier to detect, but their lower frequencies might fall outside the sensitivity range of current detectors. To detect gravitational waves from IMBHs, we would need detectors that are sensitive to lower frequencies, such as LISA."
