    "message_2": "In the context of quantum field theory, the decay rate of a Higgs boson into two photons is determined by the Higgs boson's coupling to the electromagnetic field through a loop of charged particles, such as the W boson or heavy fermions like the top quark.\n\nThe decay rate (Γ) of the Higgs boson (H) into two photons (γ) can be expressed as:\n\nΓ(H → γγ) = (α^2 * G_F * M_H^3) / (256 * π^3)\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137), G_F is the Fermi constant (approximately 1.166 x 10^-5 GeV^-2), and M_H is the mass of the Higgs boson (approximately 125 GeV).\n\nUsing these values, the decay rate of the Higgs boson into two photons is approximately:\n\nΓ(H → γγ) ≈ 8.6 x 10^-6 GeV\n\nIt is important to note that this decay rate is relatively small compared to other decay channels of the Higgs boson, such as decays into W and Z bosons or heavy fermions. However, the decay into two photons is a crucial channel for experimental detection of the Higgs boson, as it provides a clean and easily identifiable signal in particle detectors."
