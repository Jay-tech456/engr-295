    "message_2": "To calculate the compressibility factor (Z) of a gas, we can use the following equation:\n\nZ = (P * Vm) / (R * T)\n\nwhere P is the pressure, Vm is the molar volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 27째C + 273.15 = 300.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the Van der Waals constants a and b for the gas. We can use the following equations:\n\na = (27 * R^2 * Tc^2) / (64 * Pc)\nb = (R * Tc) / (8 * Pc)\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature, Pc is the critical pressure, and R is the gas constant. First, we need to convert the critical temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nTc = 132.5째C + 273.15 = 405.65 K\n\nNow we can find the Van der Waals constants a and b:\n\na = (27 * (0.0821 L atm/mol K)^2 * (405.65 K)^2) / (64 * 80.9 atm) = 3.610 L^2 atm/mol^2\nb = (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 405.65 K) / (8 * 80.9 atm) = 0.0427 L/mol\n\nNow that we have the Van der Waals constants, we can find the pressure P using the Van der Waals equation:\n\n(P + a / Vm^2) * (Vm - b) = R * T\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP = [(R * T) / (Vm - b)] - a / Vm^2\n\nP = [(0.0821 L atm/mol K * 300.15 K) / (24.79 L/mol - 0.0427 L/mol)] - 3.610 L^2 atm/mol^2 / (24.79 L/mol)^2\nP = 1.000 atm\n\nFinally, we can find the compressibility factor Z:\n\nZ = (P * Vm) / (R * T)\nZ = (1.000 atm * 24.79 L/mol) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 300.15 K)\nZ = 1.013\n\nThe compressibility factor of the gas is approximately 1.013."
