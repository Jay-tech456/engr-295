    "message_1": "A physics student is analyzing the chemical composition of a new chemical compound using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. They know that the compound has two different types of hydrogen atoms (protons), and they want to determine how many protons of each type are present. They obtain an NMR spectrum that shows two peaks, one at 2.5 ppm and another at 3.5 ppm. What is the ratio of protons of type A to protons of type B in the compound?",
    "message_2": "To determine the ratio of protons of type A to protons of type B in the compound, we need more information about the NMR spectrum, specifically the integration values or the relative areas under the peaks at 2.5 ppm and 3.5 ppm. The integration values or relative areas under the peaks represent the relative number of protons in each environment.\n\nLet's assume the integration value (or relative area) for the peak at 2.5 ppm is I_A and for the peak at 3.5 ppm is I_B. Then, the ratio of protons of type A to protons of type B can be calculated as:\n\nRatio (A:B) = I_A : I_B\n\nPlease provide the integration values or relative areas for the peaks at 2.5 ppm and 3.5 ppm to determine the ratio of protons of type A to protons of type B in the compound."
