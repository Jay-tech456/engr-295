    "message_2": "To derive the velocity profile of an incompressible fluid flowing through a circular pipe under steady-state conditions, we can use the Navier-Stokes equations. We will assume that the flow is laminar, axisymmetric, and fully developed. The pipe has a diameter D, fluid density ρ, and dynamic viscosity μ.\n\nThe Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid in cylindrical coordinates is:\n\nρ(∂v_r/∂t + v_r∂v_r/∂r + v_θ/r∂v_r/∂θ + v_z∂v_r/∂z) = -∂p/∂r + μ(1/r ∂/∂r(r∂v_r/∂r) + 1/r²∂²v_r/∂θ² + ∂²v_r/∂z²)\n\nSince the flow is steady-state, axisymmetric, and fully developed, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n1. Steady-state: ∂/∂t = 0\n2. Axisymmetric: ∂/∂θ = 0, v_θ = 0\n3. Fully developed: ∂/∂z = 0, v_r = 0\n\nAfter applying these simplifications, the Navier-Stokes equation becomes:\n\n-∂p/∂r = μ(1/r ∂/∂r(r∂v_z/∂r))\n\nNow, we can integrate the equation with respect to r:\n\n∂p/∂r = -μ(∂²v_z/∂r² - (1/r)∂v_z/∂r)\n\nIntegrating once:\n\n∂p/∂r * r = -μ(∂v_z/∂r * r + C1)\n\nIntegrating again:\n\n∂p/∂r * r²/2 = -μ(v_z * r + C1 * r + C2)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. At the pipe wall (r = D/2), the velocity is zero due to the no-slip condition: v_z(D/2) = 0\n2. At the center of the pipe (r = 0), the velocity gradient is zero due to symmetry: ∂v_z/∂r(0) = 0\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we can find the constants C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = 0\nC2 = μv_max * (D/2) - (∂p/∂r) * (D/2)²/2\n\nThe velocity profile v_z(r) is then given by:\n\nv_z(r) = -[(∂p/∂r)/(2μ)] * (r² - (D/2)²)\n\nTo plot the velocity profile as a function of radial distance from the center of the pipe, we can normalize the radial distance (r) and velocity (v_z) by the pipe radius (R = D/2) and maximum velocity (v_max), respectively:\n\nr' = r/R\nv_z' = v_z/v_max\n\nThe normalized velocity profile is:\n\nv_z'(r') = 1 - (r')²\n\nThis is a parabolic profile, with the maximum velocity at the center of the pipe (r' = 0) and zero velocity at the pipe wall (r' = 1)."
