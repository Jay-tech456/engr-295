    "message_1": "A physics student is given the following information about a substance: at its normal boiling point of 373 K, its vapor pressure is 101.3 kPa and its enthalpy of vaporization is 40.7 kJ/mol. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, what will be the vapor pressure of the substance at a temperature of 363 K?",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures, given its enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nP1 = 101.3 kPa\nT1 = 373 K\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol\nT2 = 363 K\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 363 K. First, we need to convert ΔHvap to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -(40700 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/363 K - 1/373 K)\n\nLet's solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40700 / 8.314 * (1/363 - 1/373)\nln(P2/101.3) ≈ -4.895\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural logarithm:\n\nP2/101.3 = e^(-4.895)\nP2 = 101.3 * e^(-4.895)\nP2 ≈ 73.5 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of the substance at a temperature of 363 K is approximately 73.5 kPa."
