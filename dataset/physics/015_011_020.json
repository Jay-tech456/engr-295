    "message_2": "To estimate the expected number of gravitational wave events detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory in a given year, we need to consider several factors, including the population of compact binary systems, the sensitivity of the instrument, and the observational parameters. \n\n1. Population of compact binary systems: The number of detectable events depends on the population of compact binary systems in the universe. These systems include binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and mixed systems with a black hole and a neutron star (BH-NS). The rate of these events is typically given in units of events per year per cubic gigaparsec (Gpc³).\n\n2. Sensitivity of the instrument: LISA is designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves in the range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz. This frequency range is complementary to ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo, which are sensitive to higher frequencies. LISA's sensitivity allows it to detect massive compact binaries at cosmological distances.\n\n3. Observational parameters: The expected number of events also depends on the duration of the observation and the effective volume of the universe that LISA can probe. The longer the observation time, the more events can be detected. The effective volume depends on the sensitivity of the instrument and the distribution of compact binaries in the universe.\n\nTo estimate the number of events, we can use the following formula:\n\nN = R × V × T\n\nwhere N is the expected number of events, R is the rate of events per Gpc³ per year, V is the effective volume of the universe in Gpc³ that LISA can probe, and T is the observation time in years.\n\nThe rate of events (R) depends on the specific population of compact binaries and their merger rates. For example, the rate of BBH mergers detectable by LISA is estimated to be around 1-100 events per Gpc³ per year. The effective volume (V) depends on the sensitivity of LISA and the distribution of compact binaries in the universe. The observation time (T) is typically assumed to be one year for this kind of estimation.\n\nGiven the uncertainties in the population of compact binaries and the sensitivity of LISA, it is difficult to provide a precise number for the expected number of gravitational wave events detected by LISA in a given year. However, based on current estimates, LISA is expected to detect several tens to hundreds of compact binary mergers per year, with a significant contribution from massive black hole binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs)."
