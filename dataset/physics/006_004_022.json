    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines in the hydrogen atom due to the presence of an external electric field. This effect can be analyzed using perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. The mathematical relationship between the electric field strength (E) and the energy level perturbations (ΔE) in a hydrogen atom can be derived from the first-order perturbation theory.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the unperturbed Hamiltonian (H₀) is given by:\n\nH₀ = - (ħ² / 2m) ∇² - (e² / 4πε₀r)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the distance between the electron and the proton.\n\nWhen an external electric field is applied, the perturbation Hamiltonian (H') is given by:\n\nH' = -eEz\n\nwhere E is the electric field strength and z is the position of the electron along the direction of the electric field.\n\nUsing first-order perturbation theory, the energy level perturbations (ΔE) can be calculated as:\n\nΔE = <ψ_nlm|H'|ψ_nlm>\n\nwhere ψ_nlm are the hydrogen atom wavefunctions, which are characterized by the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nFor the Stark effect, only the wavefunctions with non-zero dipole moment along the z-axis will have non-zero energy perturbations. This occurs when the magnetic quantum number m is non-zero. The energy level perturbations for the hydrogen atom in the presence of an electric field can be calculated as:\n\nΔE = (3/2) eEa₀ (m/n²)\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius.\n\nThis equation shows the mathematical relationship between the electric field strength (E) and the energy level perturbations (ΔE) in a hydrogen atom that causes the Stark effect in its spectral lines. Note that this is a simplified expression, and more accurate calculations would require higher-order perturbation theory and consideration of additional quantum numbers."
