    "message_1": "A student is conducting an experiment on single-slit diffraction using monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm. The distance between the slit and the screen is 2 meters, and the width of the slit is 0.03 mm. What is the angle at which the first minimum appears on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the first minimum appears on the screen, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the values:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.03 mm = 0.03 * 10^(-3) m\nm = 1 (for the first minimum)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.03 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 0.0006 / 0.00003\n\nsin(θ) = 20\n\nSince the value of sin(θ) cannot be greater than 1, there must be an error in the given values or the problem statement. Please double-check the values provided for the slit width and wavelength."
