    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can use the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission, which is given by:\n\nA = (64π^4 e^2) / (3 h c^3) * (1 / n1^2 - 1 / n2^2)^3 * ν^3\n\nwhere A is the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, and ν is the frequency of the emitted photon.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency of the emitted photon. We can use the formula:\n\nν = c / λ\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon (656.3 nm).\n\nν = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (656.3 x 10^-9 m)\nν ≈ 4.57 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission:\n\nA = (64π^4 (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2) / (3 (6.63 x 10^-34 Js) (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3) * (1 / 2^2 - 1 / 3^2)^3 * (4.57 x 10^14 Hz)^3\nA ≈ 4.69 x 10^8 s^-1\n\nThe lifetime of the excited state (τ) is the inverse of the Einstein's coefficient of spontaneous emission:\n\nτ = 1 / A\nτ ≈ 1 / (4.69 x 10^8 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 2.13 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state in the hydrogen atom is approximately 2.13 nanoseconds."
