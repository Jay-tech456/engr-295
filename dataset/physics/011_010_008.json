    "message_2": "To calculate the dielectric constant of a simple cubic crystal, we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation, which relates the dielectric constant (ε) to the polarizability (α) and the number density (n) of the atoms in the crystal:\n\nε = 1 + 4πnα\n\nFirst, we need to find the number density (n) of the atoms in the crystal. The number density is the number of atoms per unit volume. Since there is one atom per unit cell and the lattice constant is a, the volume of the unit cell is:\n\nV = a^3 = (5 × 10^-10 m)^3 = 1.25 × 10^-28 m^3\n\nThus, the number density (n) is:\n\nn = 1 atom / V = 1 atom / (1.25 × 10^-28 m^3) = 8 × 10^27 atoms/m^3\n\nNow, we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation to find the dielectric constant (ε):\n\nε = 1 + 4πnα\n\nε = 1 + 4π(8 × 10^27 atoms/m^3)(1.2 × 10^-40 Cm^2)\n\nε = 1 + 4π(9.6 × 10^-13 Cm^2/m^3)\n\nε = 1 + 4π(3.02 × 10^-12 Cm^2/m^3)\n\nε ≈ 1 + 3.8 × 10^-11\n\nε ≈ 1.000000038\n\nThe dielectric constant of the simple cubic crystal is approximately 1.000000038."
