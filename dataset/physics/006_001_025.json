    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from the ground state (n=1) to the first excited state (n=2), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n=1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the first excited state (n=2):\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nTo find the energy required to excite the hydrogen atom from the ground state to the first excited state, we need to find the difference in energy between these two states:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from the ground state to the first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
