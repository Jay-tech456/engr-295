    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of a silicon nanowire, we can use the following formula:\n\nk = (1/3) * C * v * L\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, C is the specific heat capacity, v is the phonon group velocity, and L is the phonon mean free path.\n\nFirst, we need to find the specific heat capacity (C) using the Debye model:\n\nC = 9 * N * k_B * (T / Θ_D)^3 * ∫(x^4 * e^x) / (e^x - 1)^2 dx from 0 to Θ_D / T\n\nwhere N is the number of atoms, k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K), T is the temperature (300 K), and Θ_D is the Debye temperature (640 K).\n\nFor simplicity, we can use the Dulong-Petit law to approximate the specific heat capacity:\n\nC = 3 * N * k_B\n\nNext, we need to find the phonon group velocity (v). For silicon, the average phonon group velocity is approximately 5,000 m/s.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nk = (1/3) * (3 * N * k_B) * 5,000 m/s * 100 nm\n\nk = N * k_B * 5,000 m/s * 100 nm\n\nSince we are interested in the thermal conductivity per unit volume, we can divide by the volume of the nanowire:\n\nk / V = (N / V) * k_B * 5,000 m/s * 100 nm\n\nThe number of atoms per unit volume (N / V) for silicon is approximately 5 × 10^28 m^-3.\n\nk / V = (5 × 10^28 m^-3) * (1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K) * 5,000 m/s * 100 nm\n\nk / V ≈ 3.45 W/m·K\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the silicon nanowire is approximately 3.45 W/m·K."
