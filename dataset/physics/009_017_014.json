    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 650 nm passes through a single slit with a width of 0.15 mm. The screen is placed at a distance of 2.0 m from the slit. What is the distance between the first dark and bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of the dark fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m + 1/2) * (λ / a)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the dark fringe, m is the fringe order (0, 1, 2, ...), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFor the first dark fringe (m = 0), we have:\n\nθ_dark = (0 + 1/2) * (λ / a) = (1/2) * (λ / a)\n\nNow, we can find the linear position of the first dark fringe on the screen (Y_dark) using the formula:\n\nY_dark = L * tan(θ_dark)\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slit and the screen.\n\nFor the first bright fringe (m = 1), we have:\n\nθ_bright = (1 + 1/2) * (λ / a) = (3/2) * (λ / a)\n\nAnd the linear position of the first bright fringe on the screen (Y_bright) is:\n\nY_bright = L * tan(θ_bright)\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the first dark and bright fringes (ΔY) as:\n\nΔY = Y_bright - Y_dark\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.15 mm = 0.15 * 10^(-3) m\nL = 2.0 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first dark and bright fringes:\n\nθ_dark = (1/2) * (650 * 10^(-9) m / 0.15 * 10^(-3) m) = 2.1667 * 10^(-6) rad\nθ_bright = (3/2) * (650 * 10^(-9) m / 0.15 * 10^(-3) m) = 6.5000 * 10^(-6) rad\n\nNext, we can find the linear positions of the first dark and bright fringes on the screen:\n\nY_dark = 2.0 m * tan(2.1667 * 10^(-6) rad) ≈ 2.0 m * (2.1667 * 10^(-6) rad) = 4.3333 * 10^(-6) m\nY_bright = 2.0 m * tan(6.5000 * 10^(-6) rad) ≈ 2.0 m * (6.5000 * 10^(-6) rad) = 1.3000 * 10^(-5) m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first dark and bright fringes:\n\nΔY = Y_bright - Y_dark = 1.3000 * 10^(-5) m - 4.3333 * 10^(-6) m = 8.6667 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first dark and bright fringes on the screen is approximately 8.67 * 10^(-6) m or 8.67 µm."
