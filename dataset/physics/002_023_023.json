    "message_2": "To determine the vapor pressure of water at a specific temperature, we can use the Antoine equation, which is a semi-empirical relationship between vapor pressure and temperature. The equation is as follows:\n\nlog10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))\n\nwhere P is the vapor pressure, T is the temperature in Celsius, and A, B, and C are Antoine coefficients specific to the substance (in this case, water). For water, the Antoine coefficients are:\n\nA = 8.07131\nB = 1730.63\nC = 233.426\n\nNow, we can plug in the temperature (25°C) into the equation:\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / (25 + 233.426))\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - (1730.63 / 258.426)\n\nlog10(P) = 8.07131 - 6.69462\n\nlog10(P) = 1.37669\n\nTo find the vapor pressure, we need to take the antilog (base 10) of the result:\n\nP = 10^1.37669\n\nP ≈ 23.76 mmHg\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 23.76 mmHg."
