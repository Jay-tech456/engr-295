Specifically, how does the gravitational force change as the planet/star approaches the event horizon, and what is the minimum distance from the black hole that an object can orbit without being pulled in?",
    "message_2": "The gravitational pull of a black hole affects the orbit of a nearby planet or star in a similar way to how any massive object affects the orbit of another object in space. The force of gravity between two objects is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nAs a planet or star approaches a black hole, the gravitational force between them increases due to the decrease in distance (r). This can cause the orbit of the planet or star to become more elliptical or even be disrupted, depending on the relative masses and initial conditions.\n\nAs the planet or star gets closer to the event horizon, the gravitational force continues to increase, and the effects of general relativity become more significant. The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, including light. The radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), is given by:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe minimum distance from the black hole that an object can stably orbit without being pulled in is called the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the ISCO is located at:\n\nR_isco = 3 * Rs\n\nThis means that the ISCO is three times the Schwarzschild radius. If an object orbits closer than the ISCO, it will eventually spiral into the black hole due to the loss of angular momentum caused by the emission of gravitational waves and other relativistic effects.\n\nFor a rotating (Kerr) black hole, the ISCO depends on the spin of the black hole and can be closer or farther away from the event horizon. In the case of a maximally spinning black hole, the ISCO can be as close as the event horizon itself.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational pull of a black hole affects the orbit of nearby planets and stars by increasing the gravitational force as they approach the event horizon. The minimum distance from the black hole that an object can orbit without being pulled in depends on the properties of the black hole and is called the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)."
