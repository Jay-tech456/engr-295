    "message_2": "To find the minimum frequency of an incident photon required to eject an electron from a tungsten surface, we can use the formula for the photoelectric effect:\n\nE_photon = E_work_function + E_kinetic\n\nwhere E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, E_work_function is the work function of the tungsten surface, and E_kinetic is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.\n\nThe energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_photon = h * f\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\nFor the minimum frequency, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is zero. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\nh * f_min = E_work_function\n\nNow we can solve for the minimum frequency:\n\nf_min = E_work_function / h\n\nGiven the work function of tungsten is 4.5 eV, we first need to convert it to Joules:\n\nE_work_function = 4.5 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 7.2 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can find the minimum frequency:\n\nf_min = (7.2 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 1.087 x 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we are given that the incident photon has a frequency of 1.5 times the minimum frequency:\n\nf = 1.5 * f_min = 1.5 * 1.087 x 10^15 Hz = 1.631 x 10^15 Hz\n\nWe can now find the energy of this photon:\n\nE_photon = h * f = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (1.631 x 10^15 Hz) = 1.08 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy of the ejected electron using the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE_kinetic = E_photon - E_work_function = 1.08 x 10^-18 J - 7.2 x 10^-19 J = 3.6 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, the minimum frequency of an incident photon required to eject an electron from a tungsten surface is 1.087 x 10^15 Hz, and the kinetic energy of the photoelectron when the incident photon has a frequency of 1.5 times the minimum frequency is 3.6 x 10^-19 J."
