    "message_1": "A disc of radius 0.1 m carries a current of 2 A uniformly distributed over its surface. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, 0.2 m away from its center? Assume that the disc is in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the disc, and that the magnetic permeability of free space is μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (z² + R²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of free space, I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and z is the distance from the center of the disc along the axis.\n\nIn this case, the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, so we need to integrate the magnetic field contribution from each infinitesimally small current loop within the disc. Let's consider a small current loop of radius r and thickness dr within the disc. The area of this loop is dA = 2πr dr, and the total area of the disc is A = πR². Since the total current is 2 A, the current in the small loop is dI = (2/A) dA = (2/πR²) * 2πr dr = (4r/R²) dr.\n\nNow we can find the magnetic field dB due to this small current loop:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * r²) / (2 * (z² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nIntegrating this expression with respect to r from 0 to R will give us the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = ∫[0, R] (μ₀ * (4r/R²) dr * r²) / (2 * (z² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4μ₀/2R²) ∫[0, R] (r³ dr) / (z² + r²)^(3/2)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let x = r² / (z² + r²). Then, dx = (2r dr) / (z² + r²)^(3/2). We can rewrite the integral in terms of x:\n\nB = (2μ₀/z²) ∫[0, R²/(R²+z²)] x dx\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nB = (2μ₀/z²) * [x²/2] evaluated from 0 to R²/(R²+z²)\n\nB = (μ₀/z²) * [R²/(R²+z²)]²\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nR = 0.1 m\nz = 0.2 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T m/A) * [0.1² / (0.1² + 0.2²)]² / (0.2²)\n\nB ≈ 1.25664 × 10⁻⁷ T * 0.01 / 0.04\n\nB ≈ 3.1416 × 10⁻⁹ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the disc, 0.2 m away from its center, is approximately 3.14 × 10⁻⁹ T. The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the disc and depends on the direction of the current. If the current is flowing clockwise when viewed from above, the magnetic field will be pointing downward, and if the current is flowing counterclockwise, the magnetic field will be pointing upward."
