    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the loop lying in the plane of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the loop is triangular, we need to break it into three segments and find the magnetic field due to each segment and then add them up.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the point is in the plane of the loop, the magnetic field due to each side will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Let's find the magnetic field due to each side of the triangle.\n\n1. Side 1: Let's assume the point is along the perpendicular bisector of side 1. The distance from the midpoint of side 1 to the point is 10 - 4 = 6 cm. The angle between the position vector and the current element is 90 degrees. So, the magnetic field due to side 1 is:\n\ndB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(90)) / (0.06)^2\n\n2. Side 2 and Side 3: The magnetic field due to the other two sides will have the same magnitude but opposite directions, so they will cancel each other out.\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB₁ along the side 1 of the triangle to find the total magnetic field due to side 1. Since the other two sides cancel each other out, the total magnetic field at the point will be due to side 1 only.\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(90)) / (0.06)^2\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dl / (0.06)^2) from 0 to 0.08\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.5 A / 4π) * (0.08 m / (0.06 m)^2)\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-7) T) * (0.08 / 0.0036)\n\nB = 4.44 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop and can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is in the clockwise direction, the magnetic field will be pointing into the plane of the loop.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the given point is 4.44 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is into the plane of the loop."
