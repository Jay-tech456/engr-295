    "message_2": "To find the critical pressure of water at its boiling point, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. The equation is as follows:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the ideal gas constant, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the boiling point of water, which is 100 °C. We need to convert this to Kelvin:\n\nT2 = 100 °C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\n\nThe normal boiling point of water is defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. We will use the standard atmospheric pressure as P1:\n\nP1 = 1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization for water is approximately ΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol. We need to convert this to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nThe ideal gas constant R can be expressed in J/(mol*K):\n\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = (40700/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/T1)\n\nWe need to find the critical temperature T1, which is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the critical pressure. For water, the critical temperature is approximately 647.1 K.\n\nln(P2/101325) = (40700/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/647.1)\n\nNow we can solve for P2, the critical pressure:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp((40700/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/647.1))\n\nP2 ≈ 22064000 Pa\n\nSo, the critical pressure of water at its boiling point of 100 °C is approximately 22.06 MPa."
