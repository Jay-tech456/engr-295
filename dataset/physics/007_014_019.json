    "message_2": "To calculate the nuclear radius of an oxygen-16 (O-16) nucleus, we can use the empirical formula for the nuclear radius, which is given by:\n\nR = R₀ * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere R is the nuclear radius, R₀ is a constant (approximately 1.2 fm, where fm stands for femtometers), and A is the mass number of the nucleus (number of protons and neutrons).\n\nFor oxygen-16 (O-16), the mass number A is 16. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nR = 1.2 * (16)^(1/3)\nR ≈ 1.2 * 2.52\nR ≈ 3.02 fm\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of an oxygen-16 (O-16) nucleus is approximately 3.02 femtometers."
