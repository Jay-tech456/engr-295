    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we can use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the object.\n\nIn this case, v = 0.8c. So, we can plug this into the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow we can plug this value into the kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (1.6667 - 1)(2 kg)(c^2)\nK ≈ 0.6667(2 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 0.6667(2 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 1.3334 x 10^17 kg m^2/s^2\n\nTherefore, the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is approximately 1.3334 x 10^17 Joules."
