    "message_1": "A rocket is launched from the surface of the Earth and reaches a distance where the gravitational potential is half that of the Earth's surface. Calculate the fractional change in the frequency of the radio signal transmitted from the rocket to the Earth's surface, given that the frequency of the signal at the launch point is 10 GHz. (Assume negligible velocity of the rocket and the Earth's surface)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of gravitational redshift. Gravitational redshift occurs when a photon (or in this case, a radio signal) escapes from a gravitational field, causing a shift in its frequency. The formula for gravitational redshift is:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔΦ/c^2)\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, ΔΦ is the change in gravitational potential, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in gravitational potential. We are given that the gravitational potential at the new location is half that of the Earth's surface. The gravitational potential at the Earth's surface (Φ_E) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΦ_E = -GM/R\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 N m²/kg²), M is the mass of the Earth (5.972 × 10^24 kg), and R is the radius of the Earth (6.371 × 10^6 m).\n\nΦ_E = -(6.674 × 10^-11 N m²/kg²)(5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (6.371 × 10^6 m)\nΦ_E ≈ -6.25 × 10^7 J/kg\n\nNow, we know that the gravitational potential at the new location is half of this value:\n\nΦ_new = 0.5 × Φ_E\nΦ_new ≈ -3.125 × 10^7 J/kg\n\nThe change in gravitational potential (ΔΦ) is the difference between the new potential and the initial potential:\n\nΔΦ = Φ_new - Φ_E\nΔΦ ≈ 3.125 × 10^7 J/kg\n\nNow we can calculate the fractional change in frequency using the gravitational redshift formula:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔΦ/c^2)\nΔf/f = (3.125 × 10^7 J/kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nΔf/f ≈ 3.472 × 10^-10\n\nThe fractional change in frequency is approximately 3.472 × 10^-10. To find the change in frequency (Δf), we can multiply this value by the initial frequency (10 GHz):\n\nΔf = (3.472 × 10^-10)(10 × 10^9 Hz)\nΔf ≈ 3.472 Hz\n\nSo, the change in frequency of the radio signal transmitted from the rocket to the Earth's surface is approximately 3.472 Hz."
