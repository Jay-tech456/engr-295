    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the latent heat of vaporization of a substance. If he places a container containing 100 g of the substance on a heater that provides heat at a constant rate of 50 W, how long will it take for the substance to completely vaporize? The initial temperature and the boiling point of the substance are known to be 25 °C and 100 °C, respectively. Calculate the latent heat of vaporization of the substance.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of vaporization of the substance, we need to first determine the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the substance from 25 °C to 100 °C, and then the amount of heat required to vaporize the substance completely.\n\n1. Heat required to raise the temperature of the substance to its boiling point:\n\nWe can use the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat required, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven the initial temperature (T1) is 25 °C and the boiling point (T2) is 100 °C, the change in temperature (ΔT) is:\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 100 °C - 25 °C = 75 °C\n\nAssuming the substance is water, the specific heat capacity (c) of water is 4.18 J/g°C. The mass (m) of the substance is given as 100 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat required (Q1) to raise the temperature of the substance:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT = (100 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(75 °C) = 31350 J\n\n2. Heat required to vaporize the substance completely:\n\nLet L be the latent heat of vaporization of the substance. The heat required (Q2) to vaporize the substance completely can be calculated using the formula Q2 = mL.\n\n3. Total heat required:\n\nThe total heat required (Q_total) to raise the temperature of the substance and vaporize it completely is the sum of Q1 and Q2:\n\nQ_total = Q1 + Q2 = 31350 J + (100 g)L\n\n4. Time taken to provide the total heat:\n\nThe heater provides heat at a constant rate of 50 W (50 J/s). We can calculate the time (t) taken to provide the total heat using the formula Q_total = P × t, where P is the power of the heater.\n\nt = Q_total / P = (31350 J + (100 g)L) / 50 J/s\n\n5. Solve for the latent heat of vaporization (L):\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine the exact time taken for the substance to vaporize completely. However, we can express the latent heat of vaporization (L) in terms of the time taken (t):\n\n100 g × L = 50 J/s × t - 31350 J\n\nL = (50 J/s × t - 31350 J) / 100 g\n\nWithout knowing the exact time taken for the substance to vaporize completely, we cannot determine the exact value of the latent heat of vaporization (L). However, we have expressed L in terms of the time taken (t), which can be used to calculate L once the time is known."
