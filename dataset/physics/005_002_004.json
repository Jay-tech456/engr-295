    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction states that the length of an object moving at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light) will appear shorter to an observer at rest relative to the object. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length as measured by the observer at rest (in this case, the observer on Earth), L0 is the proper length as measured by the passenger on board the spaceship, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given L = 60 meters and v = 0.8c. We need to solve for L0, the length of the spaceship as measured by the passenger on board.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for L0, we get:\n\nL0 = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL0 = 60 meters / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nL0 = 60 meters / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL0 = 60 meters / sqrt(0.36)\n\nL0 = 60 meters / 0.6\nL0 = 100 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger on board is 100 meters."
