    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half of the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(15 + 10) / (10 * 15) = 1/di\n\n25 / 150 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\n\ndi = 150 / 25 = 6 cm\n\nThe image is formed 6 cm away from the mirror.\n\nNext, we can determine the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nM = -6 cm / 15 cm\n\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification is -0.4, which means the image is inverted and reduced in size compared to the object."
