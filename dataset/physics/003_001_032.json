    "message_1": "A wire carrying a current of 4A is bent into a circular loop of radius 10cm. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of loop. (Assume the wire to be infinitely thin and the current to be uniformly distributed throughout the wire)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. For a circular loop, the formula for the magnetic field at the center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the current I = 4 A and the radius r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm * 4 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (16 × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = (16 × 10⁻⁷ T) / (2 × 10⁻¹ m)\n\nB = 8 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is 8 × 10⁻⁶ T (Tesla)."
