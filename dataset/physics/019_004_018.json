    "message_2": "In the context of Quantum Field Theory, the cross-section for the process of electron-positron annihilation into a muon-antimuon pair can be calculated using the leading-order Feynman diagrams. There are two leading-order diagrams for this process: the s-channel and the t-channel.\n\nThe s-channel diagram involves the exchange of a virtual photon between the electron and positron, which then annihilates into a muon-antimuon pair. The t-channel diagram involves the exchange of a virtual photon between the electron and antimuon, with the positron and muon being created as a result.\n\nThe matrix element for each diagram can be calculated using the Feynman rules for QED (Quantum Electrodynamics). The total matrix element is the sum of the matrix elements for the s-channel and t-channel diagrams.\n\nThe differential cross-section for this process can be written as:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2)/(4s) * |M|^2\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137), s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, and |M|^2 is the square of the total matrix element, summed and averaged over initial and final spins.\n\nTo obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫(dσ/dΩ) dΩ\n\nThe calculation of the matrix element and the integration can be quite involved. However, the result for the total cross-section at leading order in QED is:\n\nσ = (4πα^2)/(3s) * (1 + (2m_e^2)/(s) - (4m_e^4)/(s^2))\n\nwhere m_e is the mass of the electron.\n\nThis formula gives the cross-section for the process of electron-positron annihilation into a muon-antimuon pair, including the contributions from all leading-order Feynman diagrams."
