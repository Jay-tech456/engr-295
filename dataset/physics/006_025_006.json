    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during nuclear fission, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect (m) = 0.1865 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 3.095 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (3.095 x 10^-28 kg) * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.095 x 10^-28 kg * 8.987 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE â‰ˆ 2.78 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released when one nucleus of uranium-235 undergoes nuclear fission is approximately 2.78 x 10^-11 Joules."
