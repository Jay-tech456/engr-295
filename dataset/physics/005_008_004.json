    "message_1": "A physics student is observing two spaceships moving with a relative speed of 0.98c according to an observer standing still on Earth. The first spaceship emits a signal at time t=0, which is received by the second spaceship at time t=10 seconds (according to the observer on Earth). What is the time difference between the reception of the signal by the second spaceship according to the observer on the first spaceship and according to the observer on the Earth? Use Lorentz transformations of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the first spaceship as A and the second spaceship as B. We are given that the relative speed between the spaceships is 0.98c, and the time it takes for the signal to be received by spaceship B according to the Earth observer is 10 seconds.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) for the relative speed between the spaceships:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nwhere v is the relative speed and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.98c)²/c²)\nγ ≈ 5.025\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for the signal to be received by spaceship B according to an observer on spaceship A using the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = t / γ\nwhere t is the time according to the Earth observer (10 seconds) and t' is the time according to the observer on spaceship A.\n\nt' = 10 s / 5.025\nt' ≈ 1.99 s\n\nNow we can find the time difference between the reception of the signal by the second spaceship according to the observer on the first spaceship and according to the observer on the Earth:\n\nΔt = t - t'\nΔt = 10 s - 1.99 s\nΔt ≈ 8.01 s\n\nSo, the time difference between the reception of the signal by the second spaceship according to the observer on the first spaceship and according to the observer on the Earth is approximately 8.01 seconds."
