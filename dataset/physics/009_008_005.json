    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram for the given problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a concave mirror with its principal axis (a horizontal line).\n2. Mark the center of curvature (C) and the focal point (F) on the principal axis. Since the focal length is 10 cm, place F at 10 cm from the mirror and C at 20 cm (twice the focal length) from the mirror.\n3. Place the object (A) on the principal axis at a distance of 20 cm from the mirror (the same distance as C).\n4. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object (A) towards the mirror. After reflecting from the mirror, this ray will pass through the focal point (F).\n5. Draw another ray from the top of the object (A) towards the center of curvature (C). This ray will hit the mirror at a 90-degree angle and reflect back along the same path.\n6. The point where the two reflected rays intersect will be the location of the top of the image (A').\n\nSince the object is placed at the center of curvature, the image formed will also be at the center of curvature (20 cm from the mirror). The image will be the same size as the object, inverted, and real because it is formed by the intersection of actual light rays.\n\nSo, the image formed is real, inverted, and of the same size as the object."
