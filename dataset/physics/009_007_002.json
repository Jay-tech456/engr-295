    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a convex lens, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. For a biconvex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative, with the same absolute value (since both surfaces have the same radius of curvature).\n\nIn this case, n = 1.5 and R1 = 20 cm, so R2 = -20 cm. Plugging these values into the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/20 - 1/(-20))\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/20 + 1/20)\n1/f = 0.5 * (2/20)\n1/f = 1/20\n\nNow, we can find the focal length by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nf = 20 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the convex lens is 20 cm."
