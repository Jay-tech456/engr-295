    "message_2": "The Curie law states that the magnetization (M) of a paramagnetic material is directly proportional to the applied magnetic field (H) and inversely proportional to the temperature (T). Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nM = C * H / T\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, which can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nC = (μ₀ * N * μ^2) / (3 * k_B)\n\nHere, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 T m/A), N is the spin concentration (2.5 × 10^28 m^-3), μ is the magnetic moment (3.5 × 10^-23 J/T), and k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Curie constant (C):\n\nC = (4π × 10^-7 T m/A * 2.5 × 10^28 m^-3 * (3.5 × 10^-23 J/T)^2) / (3 * 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K)\nC ≈ 1.05 × 10^-3 m^3 K A^-1\n\nNow, we can use the Curie law to find the magnetization (M) of the material when placed in a magnetic field of 0.5 T. We need the temperature (T) to calculate the magnetization. Assuming room temperature (approximately 298 K):\n\nM = (1.05 × 10^-3 m^3 K A^-1 * 0.5 T) / 298 K\nM ≈ 1.76 × 10^-6 A/m\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility (χ) is the ratio of the magnetization (M) to the applied magnetic field (H). Since H = B / μ₀, where B is the magnetic field (0.5 T):\n\nH = 0.5 T / (4π × 10^-7 T m/A)\nH ≈ 397900 A/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = M / H\nχ = 1.76 × 10^-6 A/m / 397900 A/m\nχ ≈ 4.42 × 10^-12\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility of the material is approximately 4.42 × 10^-12."
