    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the central axis of the toroid, we can use Ampere's law and the Biot-Savart law. The magnetic field inside a toroid is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns of wire, I is the current flowing through the wire, and r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nIn this case, the toroid has 500 turns of wire (N = 500), an inner radius of 10 cm (0.1 m), an outer radius of 20 cm (0.2 m), and a uniform current of 2 A (I = 2 A). We want to calculate the magnetic field at a point on the central axis of the toroid located at a distance of 15 cm (0.15 m) from the center.\n\nSince the point is on the central axis of the toroid, we can assume that the magnetic field is approximately the same as if we were calculating it at the average radius of the toroid, which is:\n\nr_avg = (inner_radius + outer_radius) / 2\nr_avg = (0.1 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.15 m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 500 * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 1000) / (0.3 m)\n\nB ≈ 4.19 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a point on the central axis of the toroid located at a distance of 15 cm from the center is approximately 4.19 × 10⁻⁴ T."
