    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a material is the temperature below which it enters the superconducting state, where it exhibits zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields (Meissner effect). The relationship between the critical temperature and the applied magnetic field strength is described by the critical magnetic field (Hc), which is the maximum magnetic field a superconductor can tolerate before it loses its superconducting properties.\n\nThe critical magnetic field is a function of temperature and can be described by the empirical relation:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field at absolute zero temperature (0 K), T is the temperature, and Tc is the critical temperature of the material.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that as the temperature approaches the critical temperature (T -> Tc), the critical magnetic field decreases (Hc -> 0). This means that as the temperature increases, the superconductor can tolerate lower magnetic field strengths before losing its superconducting properties.\n\nNow, let's consider the application of different magnetic field strengths on the critical temperature. When a magnetic field is applied to a superconductor, it can affect the critical temperature in two ways:\n\n1. If the applied magnetic field is less than the critical magnetic field (H < Hc), the superconductor will remain in the superconducting state, and the critical temperature will not be affected.\n\n2. If the applied magnetic field is greater than the critical magnetic field (H > Hc), the superconductor will lose its superconducting properties, and the critical temperature will decrease. This is because the magnetic field disrupts the Cooper pairs (bound electron pairs responsible for superconductivity) and increases the energy required for the material to maintain the superconducting state.\n\nIn summary, the application of different magnetic field strengths affects the critical temperature at which a material enters the superconducting state by altering the critical magnetic field. If the applied magnetic field is less than the critical magnetic field, the critical temperature remains unchanged. However, if the applied magnetic field is greater than the critical magnetic field, the critical temperature decreases, as the magnetic field disrupts the superconducting state."
