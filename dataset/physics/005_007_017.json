    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the twin paradox in special relativity. To solve this problem, we need to find the time dilation experienced by the traveling twin.\n\nThe time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the traveling twin, Δt is the time experienced by the twin on Earth, v is the velocity of the traveling twin, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, Δt = 10 years, v = 0.9c, and c = 1 (in units where c = 1).\n\nΔt' = 10 * sqrt(1 - (0.9)^2)\nΔt' = 10 * sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nΔt' = 10 * sqrt(0.19)\nΔt' ≈ 10 * 0.4359\nΔt' ≈ 4.359 years\n\nSo, the traveling twin experiences approximately 4.359 years of time during their journey.\n\nNow, we can find the age difference between the twins:\n\nAge difference = Δt - Δt'\nAge difference = 10 years - 4.359 years\nAge difference ≈ 5.641 years\n\nTherefore, the age difference between the twin who travels at a speed of 0.9c for 10 years and the other twin who stays on Earth is approximately 5.641 years."
