    "message_2": "The minimum mass that a star must have in order to undergo a supernova explosion and leave behind a neutron star or black hole is typically around 8 to 10 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). This is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit.\n\nStars with masses below this limit will not have enough gravitational force to overcome the outward pressure generated by nuclear reactions in their cores. Instead, they will eventually exhaust their nuclear fuel and evolve into white dwarfs, which are supported by electron degeneracy pressure.\n\nStars with masses above the TOV limit will undergo a series of nuclear reactions throughout their lifetimes, fusing progressively heavier elements in their cores. Once the core reaches the mass of iron, further fusion becomes energetically unfavorable, and the core collapses under its own gravity. This collapse releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of neutrinos, which can drive a shockwave through the outer layers of the star, causing a supernova explosion.\n\nThe remnant core left behind after the supernova can form either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on its mass. If the core's mass is below the TOV limit (typically around 2 to 3 solar masses), it will be supported by neutron degeneracy pressure and form a neutron star. If the core's mass is above the TOV limit, it will continue to collapse under its own gravity and form a black hole."
