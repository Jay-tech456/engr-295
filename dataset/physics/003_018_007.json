    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying conductor, which is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dL is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nSince the wire is bent into a helix, we need to consider the contribution of each small segment of the wire to the magnetic field at the point of interest. Let's first find the angle α between the helix and the axis. The pitch distance is 2 cm, and we can assume that the helix makes one complete turn over this distance. Therefore, the length of one turn of the helix is:\n\nL = 2πR\n\nwhere R is the radius of the helix. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the pitch distance, the length of one turn, and the angle α:\n\ntan(α) = (2 cm) / (2πR)\n\nNow, we can express the differential length dL in terms of the angle α and the differential angle dθ:\n\ndL = R * dθ * cos(α)\n\nThe distance r from the wire to the point on the axis is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(R^2 + (10 cm)^2)\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions into the Biot-Savart law and integrate over one complete turn of the helix (from 0 to 2π):\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * ∫(dL × r) / r^3 * dθ\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * ∫(R * cos(α) * dθ) / (R^2 + (10 cm)^2)^(3/2) * dθ\n\nIntegrating over one complete turn of the helix (from 0 to 2π):\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R * cos(α)) / (4 * π * (R^2 + (10 cm)^2)^(3/2)) * ∫dθ\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R * cos(α)) / (4 * π * (R^2 + (10 cm)^2)^(3/2)) * [θ] (from 0 to 2π)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R * cos(α)) / (2 * (R^2 + (10 cm)^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow we need to find the radius R and the angle α. We can use the given pitch distance and the relationship between the pitch distance, the length of one turn, and the angle α:\n\ntan(α) = (2 cm) / (2πR)\n\nR = (2 cm) / (2π * tan(α))\n\nSubstituting this expression for R into the magnetic field formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (2 cm) * cos(α)) / (8 * π^2 * tan(α) * (4π^2 * tan^2(α) + (10 cm)^2)^(3/2))\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the helix, we cannot determine the exact value of the magnetic field at the point located on the axis of the helix, 10 cm away from the center of the helix. However, we have derived a general expression for the magnetic field that depends on the angle α between the helix and the axis."
