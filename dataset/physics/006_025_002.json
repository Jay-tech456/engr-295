    "message_2": "In the nuclear fusion process, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons) along with the release of two positrons, two neutrinos, and several gamma-ray photons. The process involves multiple steps, including the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle.\n\nThe energy released in this process is due to the mass difference between the initial hydrogen nuclei and the final helium nucleus. This mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 atomic mass units (amu), and the mass of a helium nucleus is approximately 4.001506 amu. The mass difference is:\n\n4 * 1.007276 amu - 4.001506 amu = 0.027094 amu\n\nNow, we can convert this mass difference into energy:\n\nE = (0.027094 amu) * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE â‰ˆ 4.03 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nThis is the energy released per fusion event. In the Sun, this process occurs on a massive scale, producing an enormous amount of energy that powers the Sun and provides light and heat to the Earth."
