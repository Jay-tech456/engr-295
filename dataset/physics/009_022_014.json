    "message_1": "A physics student must solve the following problem related to Brewster's Law: \n\nAn incident light with an intensity of 60 W/m² strikes a glass surface at an angle of incidence of 50°. The polarizing angle for the glass is found to be 56°. If 30% of the incident light is reflected, what is the angle of refraction for the transmitted light?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the refractive index of the glass (n2). We can use Brewster's Law, which states that the polarizing angle (θp) is related to the refractive index by:\n\ntan(θp) = n2\n\nPlugging in the polarizing angle of 56°, we get:\n\ntan(56°) = n2\nn2 ≈ 1.482\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction (θ2). The refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1. We are given the angle of incidence (θ1) as 50°. Plugging these values into Snell's Law, we get:\n\n1 * sin(50°) = 1.482 * sin(θ2)\n\nSolving for θ2, we get:\n\nsin(θ2) = sin(50°) / 1.482\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(50°) / 1.482)\nθ2 ≈ 32.1°\n\nTherefore, the angle of refraction for the transmitted light is approximately 32.1°."
