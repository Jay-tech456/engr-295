    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as α_s, is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the strength of the strong nuclear force in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Its value depends on the energy scale at which it is probed, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. As the energy scale increases, the strong coupling constant decreases, and vice versa.\n\nTo determine the value of α_s at a specific energy scale, we need to know the energy scale (Q) and use the renormalization group equations. The energy scale is typically given in units of electron volts (eV) or giga-electron volts (GeV). The value of α_s at the Z boson mass scale (m_Z ≈ 91.2 GeV) is often used as a reference point, with α_s(m_Z) ≈ 0.118.\n\nIn the confinement phase, the energy scale is low, which means the strong coupling constant is large. This strong coupling leads to the confinement of quarks and gluons within hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. Quarks and gluons cannot be isolated as free particles in this phase due to the strong force between them. Instead, they are bound together in color-neutral combinations called hadrons.\n\nThe behavior of quarks and gluons within hadrons is influenced by the large value of the strong coupling constant in the confinement phase. The strong force between quarks and gluons becomes stronger as they are separated, making it nearly impossible to isolate individual quarks or gluons. This is in contrast to the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energy scales, where the strong coupling constant is smaller, and they can behave as nearly free particles.\n\nIn summary, the value of the strong coupling constant at a specific energy scale during the confinement phase is large, leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within hadrons. This strong coupling affects the behavior of quarks and gluons, making them tightly bound together in color-neutral combinations."
