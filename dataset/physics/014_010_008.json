    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass and size of a black hole is given by the Schwarzschild radius, which determines the event horizon of a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light.\n\nThe innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is the smallest stable orbit that a test particle can have around a black hole without falling into it. The ISCO depends on the black hole's mass and its angular momentum (spin). For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the ISCO is at a radius of 3 times the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nR_ISCO = 3Rs = 6GM/c^2\n\nFor a rotating (Kerr) black hole, the ISCO depends on the black hole's spin parameter (a), which is defined as the ratio of the black hole's angular momentum to its mass:\n\na = J/M\n\nThe ISCO for a Kerr black hole is given by:\n\nR_ISCO = GM/c^2 * (3 + Z2 - sqrt((3-Z1)(3+Z1+2Z2)))\n\nwhere Z1 = 1 + (1 - a^2)^(1/3) * ((1 + a)^(1/3) + (1 - a)^(1/3)) and Z2 = sqrt(3 * a^2 + Z1^2)\n\nAs the spin parameter a increases, the ISCO moves closer to the black hole's event horizon. This means that particles can orbit closer to a rotating black hole than to a non-rotating one before becoming unstable and falling in.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a black hole determines its size through the Schwarzschild radius, and the ISCO depends on both the mass and the spin of the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, the ISCO is at 3 times the Schwarzschild radius, while for rotating black holes, the ISCO moves closer to the event horizon as the spin increases."
