    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of 20 cm. An object is placed 10 cm in front of the mirror. What will be the position and magnification of the image formed by the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is related to the focal length by:\n\nf = R/2\n\nIn this case, R = 20 cm, so the focal length f = 20/2 = 10 cm.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/10\n1/v = 2/10\nv = 10/2\nv = 5 cm\n\nThe image is formed 5 cm in front of the mirror.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (M) of the image, we can use the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nM = -5/(-10)\nM = 1/2\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1/2 or 0.5, which means the image is half the size of the object.\n\nSo, the image is formed 5 cm in front of the mirror, and its magnification is 0.5."
