    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the adiabatic process equation and the work done equation for an adiabatic process.\n\nFor an adiabatic process, the equation is:\n\nPV^γ = constant\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index, which is equal to the ratio of specific heat capacities (Cp/Cv). For an ideal diatomic gas, γ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant in the adiabatic process equation using the initial pressure and volume:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\n2 atm * (5 L)^1.4 = 1 atm * (10 L)^1.4\n\nNow, we'll solve for the constant:\n\nconstant = 2 atm * (5 L)^1.4\n\nNext, we'll use the work done equation for an adiabatic process:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nW = (2 atm * 5 L - 1 atm * 10 L) / (1.4 - 1)\n\nW = (10 atm L - 10 atm L) / 0.4\n\nW = 0 atm L / 0.4\n\nW = 0 J\n\nThe amount of work done by the gas during this adiabatic process is 0 Joules."
