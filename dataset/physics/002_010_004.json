    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat required to vaporize 50 grams of water to steam at 100°C, we can use the following formula:\n\nQ = m * L\n\nwhere Q is the amount of heat, m is the mass of water, and L is the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water from grams to moles. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of water = (mass of water) / (molar mass of water)\nmoles of water = 50 g / 18.015 g/mol\nmoles of water ≈ 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of heat required:\n\nQ = m * L\nQ = 2.775 moles * 40.7 kJ/mol\nQ ≈ 112.9425 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat required to vaporize 50 grams of water to steam at 100°C is approximately 112.94 kJ."
