    "message_1": "Sure, here's a sample problem:\n\n\"A sample of water at 100°C and a pressure of 1 atm has a heat of vaporization of 40.7 kJ/mol. If the pressure is lowered to 0.5 atm, what is the new boiling point of water, assuming that the heat of vaporization remains constant with temperature and pressure?\" \n\nThe student would need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to calculate the new boiling point temperature.",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures (in atm)\nT1 and T2 are the initial and final boiling point temperatures (in Kelvin)\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization (in J/mol)\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K)\n\nWe are given:\nP1 = 1 atm\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\nP2 = 0.5 atm\n\nWe need to find T2.\n\nRearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/T1 + R/ΔHvap * ln(P2/P1)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 + (8.314/40700) * ln(0.5/1)\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 - (8.314/40700) * ln(2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of 1/T2:\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002680 - 0.000169\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002511\n\nTo find T2, we take the reciprocal of the value we just calculated:\n\nT2 ≈ 1/0.002511\nT2 ≈ 398.3 K\n\nNow, we convert the temperature back to Celsius:\n\nT2 ≈ 398.3 - 273.15\nT2 ≈ 125.15°C\n\nSo, the new boiling point of water at 0.5 atm is approximately 125.15°C."
