    "message_2": "To calculate the cross section for the nuclear reaction between a helium-4 nucleus and a carbon-12 nucleus, we can use the classical formula for the nuclear cross section, which is given by:\n\nσ = π(R₁ + R₂)²\n\nwhere σ is the cross section, R₁ is the radius of the helium-4 nucleus, and R₂ is the radius of the carbon-12 nucleus.\n\nGiven that the radius of the helium-4 nucleus is 1.2 femtometers (fm) and the radius of the carbon-12 nucleus is 3.3 femtometers (fm), we can calculate the cross section as follows:\n\nσ = π(1.2 fm + 3.3 fm)²\nσ = π(4.5 fm)²\nσ = π(20.25 fm²)\nσ ≈ 63.62 fm²\n\nSo, the cross section for the nuclear reaction between a helium-4 nucleus and a carbon-12 nucleus at a collision energy of 2 MeV is approximately 63.62 femtometers squared (fm²)."
