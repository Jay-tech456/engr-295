    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a measure of the strength of the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together within protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. Its value depends on the energy scale at which it is probed, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. This means that αs decreases as the energy scale (or momentum transfer) increases.\n\nThe Z boson mass is approximately 91.2 GeV. To determine the value of the strong coupling constant at this energy scale, we need to use the deep inelastic scattering data and the renormalization group equations that describe the running of αs with energy.\n\nThe specific value of αs at the Z boson mass scale can vary slightly depending on the experimental data and the order of the perturbative QCD calculations used. However, a commonly cited value for the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale is:\n\nαs(Mz) ≈ 0.118\n\nThis value is determined from a combination of experimental data, including deep inelastic scattering, as well as other processes like e+e- annihilation and hadron collider measurements. Keep in mind that this value has some uncertainty associated with it, and ongoing experimental and theoretical work aims to reduce this uncertainty and improve our understanding of the strong force."
