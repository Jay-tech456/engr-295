    "message_2": "A single photon can be used to encode one qubit of information, as it can exist in a superposition of two states. These two states can represent the binary values 0 and 1, which are the basis states for a qubit. \n\nAs for the success rate of this encoding scheme, it is important to note that increasing the number of qubits requires more photons, as each photon can only encode one qubit. The success rate of the encoding scheme will depend on the efficiency and reliability of the quantum system being used, such as the quality of the photon sources, detectors, and any potential noise or errors that may be introduced during the encoding and decoding processes.\n\nIn summary, a single photon can encode one qubit, and the success rate of the encoding scheme will depend on the quality and efficiency of the quantum system being used, rather than the number of qubits being encoded."
