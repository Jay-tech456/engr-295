    "message_2": "To gather evidence supporting the hypothesis that dark matter is made up of dark atoms or dark molecules, we can focus on several experimental and observational approaches:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter is known to affect the path of light due to its gravitational influence. By studying the distribution of dark matter through gravitational lensing, we can gain insights into its properties and potentially identify signatures of dark atoms or dark molecules.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is a relic from the early universe and contains information about the distribution and properties of dark matter. Analyzing the CMB data might reveal clues about the nature of dark matter, including the possibility of dark atoms or dark molecules.\n\n3. Large-scale structure formation: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe. By studying the distribution and behavior of these structures, we can infer properties of dark matter and test the dark atom or dark molecule hypothesis.\n\n4. Direct detection experiments: Several experiments are currently underway to directly detect dark matter particles, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various underground detectors. If dark atoms or dark molecules exist, they might be detected in these experiments through their interactions with ordinary matter.\n\n5. Indirect detection experiments: Dark matter particles might also be detected indirectly through their annihilation or decay products. Observations of high-energy gamma rays, cosmic rays, or neutrinos could provide evidence for dark atoms or dark molecules if their signatures match theoretical predictions.\n\n6. Theoretical models and simulations: Developing theoretical models and running simulations of dark matter interactions can help us understand the possible behavior of dark atoms or dark molecules. Comparing these models with observational data can provide support for or against the hypothesis.\n\nBy combining the results from these various approaches, we can gather evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that dark matter is made up of dark atoms or dark molecules. However, it is important to note that the nature of dark matter is still a major unsolved problem in physics, and further research is needed to fully understand its properties and composition."
