    "message_2": "The expected rate of detection of gravitational waves generated by a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of current and upcoming gravitational-wave detectors, the formation and evolution of black holes, and the frequency of events involving IMBHs.\n\nIntermediate-mass black holes are those with masses between approximately 100 and 10,000 solar masses. They are expected to form through various processes, such as the collapse of massive stars, the merger of smaller black holes, or the direct collapse of massive gas clouds.\n\nCurrent gravitational-wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, have primarily detected gravitational waves from the mergers of stellar-mass black holes (with masses between 1 and 100 solar masses) and neutron stars. The sensitivity of these detectors is limited by their design and noise sources, which makes the detection of IMBHs more challenging. However, they have already detected a few events that could involve IMBHs, such as GW190521, which resulted from the merger of two black holes with masses of about 85 and 66 solar masses.\n\nUpcoming gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, are expected to have improved sensitivity and frequency coverage, which will increase the chances of detecting IMBHs. The Einstein Telescope, a ground-based detector, will have a sensitivity about ten times better than LIGO and Virgo, while LISA, a space-based detector, will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, which are expected from the mergers of more massive black holes.\n\nTheoretical models of the formation and evolution of black holes can provide estimates of the rate of IMBH mergers. However, these estimates are uncertain due to the limited understanding of the processes involved in the formation and evolution of IMBHs. Some studies suggest that the merger rate of IMBHs could be between 0.1 and 100 per Gpc^3 per year.\n\nConsidering the sensitivity of current and upcoming gravitational-wave detectors and the uncertainties in the theoretical models, it is difficult to provide a precise expected rate of detection of gravitational waves generated by IMBHs. However, with the improvements in detector sensitivity and the increasing number of observations, it is likely that the detection rate of IMBHs will increase in the coming years, providing valuable insights into their formation and evolution."
