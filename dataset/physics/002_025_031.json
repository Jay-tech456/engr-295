    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of a mixture of water and ethanol with a mass ratio of 1:1, we can use the formula for the specific heat capacity of a mixture:\n\nC_mix = (m1 * C1 + m2 * C2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of water and ethanol, respectively, and C1 and C2 are their specific heat capacities.\n\nAt 25°C and 1 atmosphere, the specific heat capacity of water (C1) is approximately 4.18 J/g°C, and the specific heat capacity of ethanol (C2) is approximately 2.44 J/g°C.\n\nSince the mass ratio of water to ethanol is 1:1, we can assume m1 = m2. Let's call this mass m. Then the formula becomes:\n\nC_mix = (m * 4.18 + m * 2.44) / (m + m)\n\nC_mix = (m * (4.18 + 2.44)) / (2m)\n\nC_mix = (m * 6.62) / (2m)\n\nC_mix = 6.62 / 2\n\nC_mix ≈ 3.31 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of a 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol at 25°C and 1 atmosphere is approximately 3.31 J/g°C."
