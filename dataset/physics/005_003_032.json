What is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth? (Assume the direction of motion is the same for both spaceships.)",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth (0.9c), v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = (0.9c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.9c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nv = (1.7c) / (1 + 0.72c^2 / c^2)\n\nv = (1.7c) / (1 + 0.72)\n\nv = (1.7c) / 1.72\n\nv = 0.98837c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to Earth is approximately 0.98837c, or 98.837% of the speed of light."
