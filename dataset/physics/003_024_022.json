    "message_1": "A circular loop of wire with a radius of 0.10 meters carries a current of 3.0 amps. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop? Assume the wire is thin and the current is uniformly distributed around the loop.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3.0 A) / (2 * 0.10 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) T·m) / 0.20 m\n\nB = 60π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 1.885 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.885 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
