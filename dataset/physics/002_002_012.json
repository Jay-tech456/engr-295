    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat transferred to the gas, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass of the gas, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 2 kg\nc = 20 J/K\nInitial temperature (T1) = 200 K\nFinal temperature (T2) = 400 K\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 400 K - 200 K\nΔT = 200 K\n\nNow, we can find the amount of heat transferred (Q):\n\nQ = mcΔT\nQ = (2 kg)(20 J/K)(200 K)\nQ = 40 J/K * 200 K\nQ = 8000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat transferred to the gas is 8000 Joules."
