    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (h-bar) divided by 2:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js.\n\nWe are given the momentum uncertainty (Δp) as 5.0 × 10^-26 kg m/s. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in the position (Δx).\n\nRearranging the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula to solve for Δx:\n\nΔx ≥ ħ/(2 * Δp)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 5.0 × 10^-26 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (1.0 × 10^-25 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ 1.0545718 × 10^-9 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 1.05 × 10^-9 meters or 1.05 nm."
