    "message_2": "In Young's double slit experiment, the interference pattern of light on the screen is due to the superposition of waves from two slits. The distance between the bright fringes can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\(n * λ = (d * x) / L\\)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the order of the bright fringe (1 for the first bright fringe, 2 for the second, etc.)\n- λ is the wavelength of the light (550 nm in this case)\n- d is the distance between the slits\n- x is the distance between the central bright fringe and the nth bright fringe (2.5 cm in this case)\n- L is the distance between the screen and the slits (1 meter in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find the order of the bright fringe (n). Since we know the distance between the central bright fringe and the nth bright fringe (x), we can use the formula for the distance between adjacent bright fringes:\n\n\\(x = n * λ * L / d\\)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for n:\n\n\\(n = (x * d) / (λ * L)\\)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n\\(n = (2.5 * 10^{-2} m * d) / (550 * 10^{-9} m * 1 m)\\)\n\nTo solve for the distance between the slits (d), we can rearrange the formula:\n\n\\(d = (n * λ * L) / x\\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\(d = (n * 550 * 10^{-9} m * 1 m) / (2.5 * 10^{-2} m)\\)\n\nSince we don't know the value of n, we can't find the exact distance between the slits (d). However, we can express the distance between the slits in terms of n:\n\n\\(d = (n * 550 * 10^{-9} m * 1 m) / (2.5 * 10^{-2} m)\\)\n\n\\(d = (22 * 10^{-7} m * n)\\)\n\nSo, the distance between the slits in Young's double slit experiment is 22 * 10^{-7} meters times the order of the bright fringe (n)."
