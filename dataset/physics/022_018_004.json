    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are a type of dark matter candidate that includes objects such as black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and other massive compact objects. They were proposed as a possible explanation for the missing mass in the Universe that is not accounted for by visible matter.\n\nThe upper limit on the percentage of dark matter that can be composed of MACHOs has been constrained by various observational data, such as gravitational microlensing surveys, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and the large-scale structure of the Universe.\n\nGravitational microlensing surveys, such as the MACHO Project, EROS, and OGLE, have provided strong constraints on the abundance of MACHOs in the mass range of 10^-7 to 10^2 solar masses. These surveys have found that MACHOs with masses in this range can only account for a small fraction of the total dark matter, typically less than 20%.\n\nAdditionally, the CMB radiation and large-scale structure observations have provided further constraints on the amount of baryonic matter (which includes MACHOs) in the Universe. These observations indicate that baryonic matter can only account for about 5% of the total mass-energy content of the Universe, while dark matter accounts for about 27%. This means that MACHOs, as a subset of baryonic matter, can only contribute a small fraction of the total dark matter content.\n\nBased on these observational constraints, the upper limit on the percentage of dark matter that can be composed of MACHOs is likely less than 20%, and possibly much lower. This has led to a greater focus on non-baryonic dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions, which are not subject to the same observational constraints as MACHOs."
