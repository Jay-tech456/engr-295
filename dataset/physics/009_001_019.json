    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 (air) = 1, θ1 = 30 degrees, and n2 (glass) = 1.5. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.5 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.3333 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction when the ray of light travels from air to glass is approximately 19.47 degrees."
