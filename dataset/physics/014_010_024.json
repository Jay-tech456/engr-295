    "message_2": "There is no known maximum mass limit for a black hole to exist. Black holes can grow indefinitely by accreting mass from their surroundings or merging with other black holes. However, the growth of black holes may be limited by the availability of matter in their vicinity and the rate at which they can accrete it.\n\nThe size of a black hole's event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, is directly proportional to its mass. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. As the mass of the black hole increases, so does the size of its event horizon.\n\nThe gravitational pull of a black hole is determined by its mass and the distance from its center. The gravitational force (F) between two objects can be calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF = GMm/r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, m is the mass of the object being attracted, and r is the distance between the centers of the two masses. As the mass of the black hole increases, its gravitational pull becomes stronger.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the gravitational pull of a black hole at a given distance from its center is the same as that of any other object with the same mass. The key difference is that the black hole's mass is concentrated within an extremely small volume, leading to the formation of an event horizon and the unique properties associated with black holes."
