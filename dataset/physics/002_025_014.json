    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) of the mixture, we need to know the specific heat capacity of each individual gas and then calculate the weighted average based on their percentage in the mixture.\n\nThe specific heat capacity at constant volume for each gas can be found in standard tables or literature. The values are as follows:\n\n1. Nitrogen (N2): Cv = 20.8 J/mol·K\n2. Oxygen (O2): Cv = 20.8 J/mol·K\n3. Carbon dioxide (CO2): Cv = 28.6 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the weighted average of the specific heat capacity for the mixture:\n\nCv_mixture = (Cv_N2 × %N2) + (Cv_O2 × %O2) + (Cv_CO2 × %CO2)\n\nCv_mixture = (20.8 J/mol·K × 0.6) + (20.8 J/mol·K × 0.2) + (28.6 J/mol·K × 0.2)\n\nCv_mixture = (12.48 J/mol·K) + (4.16 J/mol·K) + (5.72 J/mol·K)\n\nCv_mixture = 22.36 J/mol·K\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity at constant volume of the mixture is approximately 22.36 J/mol·K at 298 K and 1 atm pressure."
