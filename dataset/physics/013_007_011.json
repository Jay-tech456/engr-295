    "message_2": "The mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo can be estimated using the observed kinematics of its satellite galaxies. The methodology for calculating the mass estimate involves several steps, which are outlined below:\n\n1. Identify satellite galaxies: First, we need to identify the satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. These galaxies are gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and can provide valuable information about the mass distribution of our galaxy.\n\n2. Measure velocities: Next, we need to measure the velocities of these satellite galaxies. This can be done using Doppler shift measurements of spectral lines emitted by stars within the satellite galaxies. The Doppler shift allows us to determine the radial velocities of the galaxies relative to the Milky Way.\n\n3. Calculate mass using the Virial Theorem: The Virial Theorem relates the kinetic energy and potential energy of a gravitationally bound system, such as the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies. The theorem states that the total kinetic energy (T) and the total potential energy (U) of the system are related as follows:\n\n   2T + U = 0\n\nUsing the measured velocities of the satellite galaxies, we can calculate the total kinetic energy of the system. The potential energy can be calculated using the gravitational force between the satellite galaxies and the Milky Way. By solving the Virial Theorem equation, we can estimate the total mass of the Milky Way, including its dark matter halo.\n\n4. Subtract baryonic mass: To estimate the mass of the dark matter halo, we need to subtract the baryonic mass (mass of stars, gas, and dust) of the Milky Way from the total mass calculated in step 3. The baryonic mass can be estimated using various observational techniques, such as measuring the luminosity of the galaxy and assuming a mass-to-light ratio.\n\nThe estimated mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo based on the observed kinematics of its satellite galaxies is approximately 1-2 x 10^12 solar masses. This value is subject to uncertainties due to factors such as the assumptions made in the mass-to-light ratio and the limited number of satellite galaxies with measured velocities. However, this method provides a reasonable estimate of the dark matter halo mass and helps us understand the distribution of mass in our galaxy."
