    "message_2": "The ground state energy of carbon-12 (12C) is the lowest energy level that the nucleus can occupy, and it is defined as zero energy. In this state, the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are arranged in the most stable configuration. When the nucleus is excited to a higher energy level, it is said to be in an excited state.\n\nThe excited states of carbon-12 are characterized by higher energy levels compared to the ground state. These excited states can be reached when the nucleus absorbs energy, such as through the interaction with a high-energy photon or a collision with another particle. The energy levels of the excited states are quantized, meaning they can only take on specific values.\n\nThe behavior of the different energy levels in carbon-12 can be explained by the nuclear shell model. In this model, protons and neutrons are arranged in energy levels or shells, similar to the arrangement of electrons in atomic orbitals. The energy levels are determined by the balance between the attractive strong nuclear force and the repulsive Coulomb force between protons.\n\nIn carbon-12, the ground state has six protons and six neutrons arranged in the most stable configuration. The first excited state of carbon-12 is at an energy level of approximately 4.44 MeV (million electron volts) above the ground state. This state is characterized by a rearrangement of the protons and neutrons within the nucleus, leading to a less stable configuration.\n\nThe physical properties that explain the behavior of the different energy levels in carbon-12 include the strong nuclear force, which holds the protons and neutrons together, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two nucleons (protons or neutrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. The energy levels are also influenced by the spin and angular momentum of the nucleons, as well as the symmetry of the nuclear wave function.\n\nIn summary, the ground state energy of carbon-12 is defined as zero, and its excited states have higher energy levels due to the rearrangement of protons and neutrons within the nucleus. The behavior of these energy levels can be explained by the nuclear shell model and the balance between the strong nuclear force and the Coulomb force, as well as other quantum mechanical properties."
