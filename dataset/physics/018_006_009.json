    "message_2": "The evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy in our universe comes from various observations and measurements that cannot be explained by the presence of ordinary matter and energy alone. These mysterious substances play a crucial role in the behavior and evolution of galaxies and other large-scale structures in the universe. Here are some key pieces of evidence and their effects on the cosmos:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, as predicted by general relativity, has been observed in many instances. In some cases, the amount of lensing is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass of the objects. This excess lensing can be attributed to the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal a specific pattern that can only be explained if dark matter exists and contributes to the overall mass-energy content of the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of cosmic evolution show that without dark matter, the large-scale structures we observe today would not have formed.\n\n5. Accelerating expansion of the universe: Observations of distant supernovae have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, rather than slowing down as expected due to the gravitational attraction of matter. This accelerated expansion can be explained by the presence of dark energy, which acts as a repulsive force, counteracting gravity.\n\nDark matter and dark energy have significant effects on the behavior and evolution of galaxies and other large-scale structures:\n\n- Dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to hold galaxies together and helps to shape their structure. It also plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n- Dark energy, on the other hand, affects the overall expansion rate of the universe. Its repulsive force counteracts gravity and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. This acceleration influences the growth and evolution of large-scale structures, as it limits the formation of new galaxy clusters and affects the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for dark matter and dark energy comes from various observations that cannot be explained by ordinary matter and energy alone. These mysterious substances play crucial roles in shaping the behavior and evolution of galaxies and other large-scale structures in the universe."
