    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first dark fringe and the central bright fringe, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe, m is the order of the dark fringe (m = 1 for the first dark fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\nL (distance from the slit to the screen) = 1.2 m\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3))\nθ = arcsin((1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)))\n\nθ ≈ 0.0025 radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the distance y between the first dark fringe and the central bright fringe on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\ny = 1.2 * 0.0025\ny ≈ 0.003 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first dark fringe and the central bright fringe on the screen is approximately 0.003 meters or 3 millimeters."
