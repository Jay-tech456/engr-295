    "message_1": "A toroidal solenoid has 2000 turns, an inner radius of 5 cm and outer radius of 10 cm. The current flowing through the solenoid is 5 A. What is the magnetic field inside the toroid at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field inside the toroid at a distance of 3 cm from the center, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) inside a toroidal solenoid is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nN = 2000 turns (number of turns in the solenoid)\nI = 5 A (current flowing through the solenoid)\nr = 0.03 m (distance from the center of the toroid, converted from 3 cm to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2000 * 5) / (2 * π * 0.03)\n\nB ≈ (4 * 10^(-7) * 2000 * 5) / (2 * 0.03)\n\nB ≈ (4 * 10^(-7) * 10000) / 0.06\n\nB ≈ (4 * 10^(-3)) / 0.06\n\nB ≈ 0.0667 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field inside the toroid at a distance of 3 cm from the center is approximately 0.0667 Tesla."
