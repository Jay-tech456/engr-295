    "message_1": "A heat pump is used to maintain a room at a temperature of 25°C using air from outside which is at a temperature of 5°C. The heat pump has a power input of 5 kW and it extracts heat from the surroundings at a rate of 8 kW. Calculate the coefficient of performance of the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat energy transferred to the room (Q) to the work input (W) required to run the heat pump. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nCOP = Q / W\n\nIn this problem, the heat pump extracts heat from the surroundings at a rate of 8 kW (Q) and has a power input of 5 kW (W). Therefore, the coefficient of performance can be calculated as:\n\nCOP = Q / W\nCOP = 8 kW / 5 kW\nCOP = 1.6\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 1.6."
