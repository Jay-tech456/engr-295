    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through different parts of a lens converge at different points along the optical axis. This is due to the fact that the lens has a spherical shape, and the curvature of the lens is not ideal for focusing all rays at the same point. To minimize spherical aberration, we can use the paraxial approximation, which assumes that the rays are close to the optical axis and make a small angle with it.\n\nTo determine the spherical aberration, we can use the formula:\n\nSA = (n-1) * (R1 - R2) * h^4 / (64 * n * f^3)\n\nwhere SA is the spherical aberration, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces, h is the height of the ray from the optical axis, and f is the focal length of the lens.\n\nHowever, we are not given the refractive index or the radii of curvature of the lens. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the spherical aberration using this formula.\n\nTo find the distance from the axis where the spherical aberration is minimum, we can use the formula:\n\nh_min = (8 * f * (n-1) * (R1 - R2) / (3 * n))^1/4\n\nAgain, we do not have the refractive index or the radii of curvature, so we cannot directly calculate the minimum distance from the axis.\n\nIn summary, without the refractive index and radii of curvature of the lens, we cannot determine the spherical aberration or the distance from the axis where the spherical aberration is minimum."
