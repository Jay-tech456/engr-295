    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves generated by the collapse of a massive star are influenced by several factors, including the mass of the collapsing star and the distance between the source of the waves and the observer. Here's a general overview of how these factors affect the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\n1. Mass of the collapsing star: The mass of the collapsing star plays a crucial role in determining the amplitude and frequency of the generated gravitational waves. More massive stars generate stronger gravitational waves with higher amplitudes. The frequency of the waves is also related to the mass of the star. In general, more massive stars produce gravitational waves with lower frequencies, while less massive stars produce waves with higher frequencies.\n\n2. Distance from the source: The amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases as the distance from the source increases. This is because the waves spread out over a larger area as they travel through space, causing their energy to be distributed over a larger volume. The relationship between the amplitude and distance is an inverse relationship, meaning that the amplitude of the waves is inversely proportional to the distance from the source. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nAmplitude ‚àù 1/distance\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves, however, is not affected by the distance from the source. The frequency remains constant as the waves travel through space.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of gravitational waves generated by the collapse of a massive star is directly proportional to the mass of the star and inversely proportional to the distance from the source. The frequency of the waves is related to the mass of the star, with more massive stars producing lower frequency waves and less massive stars producing higher frequency waves. The frequency remains constant as the waves travel through space, regardless of the distance from the source."
