    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal power produced by the pressurized water reactor, we can use the formula:\n\nThermal Power = Reactor Core Power / Thermal Efficiency\n\nGiven the thermal efficiency of 33% (0.33) and the reactor core generating 3,000 MW of energy, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nThermal Power = 3,000 MW / 0.33\n\nThermal Power â‰ˆ 9,090.91 MW\n\nTherefore, the thermal power produced by the pressurized water reactor is approximately 9,090.91 MW."
