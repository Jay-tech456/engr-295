    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise problem for a physics student to solve in the subtopic of Study of thermal properties of materials in Condensed matter physics:\n\nWhat is the thermal conductivity of a metal rod of length L, cross-sectional area A, and thermal diffusivity D, given that the temperature difference between the ends of the rod is ΔT and that the time it takes for heat to flow through the rod is t? Use the formula κ = DA/L to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the thermal conductivity (κ) of the metal rod, we can use the given formula:\n\nκ = DA/L\n\nHowever, we need the values for the thermal diffusivity (D), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) to calculate the thermal conductivity. Since these values are not provided, I will use some example values to demonstrate the calculation.\n\nLet's assume the following values:\nThermal diffusivity (D) = 1.0 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\nLength (L) = 0.5 m\nCross-sectional area (A) = 0.01 m²\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nκ = (1.0 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s) × (0.01 m²) / (0.5 m)\n\nκ = 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ m³/s\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the metal rod with the given example values is 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ m³/s. Please note that this is just an example calculation, and the actual thermal conductivity will depend on the specific values provided for D, L, and A."
