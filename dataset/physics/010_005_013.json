    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum height reached by the soccer ball, we need to consider the forces acting on the ball and the initial velocity. The forces acting on the ball are gravity, drag force, and lift force.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial vertical velocity component. We don't have the angle at which the ball was kicked, so let's assume it was kicked at a 45-degree angle for simplicity. This means the vertical and horizontal components of the initial velocity are equal.\n\nInitial vertical velocity (v_y) = 15 m/s * sin(45) = 15 * 0.707 = 10.605 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the net force acting on the ball in the vertical direction. The gravitational force (F_g) is given by:\n\nF_g = m * g\nwhere m = 0.45 kg (mass of the ball) and g = 9.81 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)\n\nF_g = 0.45 * 9.81 = 4.4145 N\n\nThe net force in the vertical direction (F_net) is the difference between the gravitational force, drag force, and lift force:\n\nF_net = F_g - F_drag - F_lift = 4.4145 - 0.2 - 0.05 = 4.1645 N\n\nNow, we can use the work-energy theorem to find the maximum height (h) reached by the ball:\n\nW = ΔK.E\nwhere W is the work done by the net force, and ΔK.E is the change in kinetic energy\n\nSince the ball comes to a stop at its maximum height, the final kinetic energy is 0. Thus, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the initial kinetic energy:\n\nΔK.E = 0.5 * m * (v_y)^2 = 0.5 * 0.45 * (10.605)^2 = 25.313 J\n\nThe work done by the net force is given by:\n\nW = F_net * h\n\nNow, equating the work done by the net force to the change in kinetic energy:\n\nF_net * h = ΔK.E\nh = ΔK.E / F_net = 25.313 / 4.1645 = 6.079 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum height reached by the soccer ball before it hits the ground is approximately 6.08 meters."
