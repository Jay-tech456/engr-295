    "message_2": "To estimate the thermal radiation radius of a nuclear weapon, we can use the following formula:\n\nR = (Y^2/3 * E / Q)^1/2\n\nWhere:\n- R is the thermal radiation radius\n- Y is the yield of the explosion in kilotons of TNT equivalent (1 megaton = 1000 kilotons)\n- E is the thermal energy fraction (typically around 0.35 for nuclear weapons)\n- Q is the thermal radiation exposure in cal/cm^2 (calories per square centimeter)\n\nFor this problem, we will consider a thermal radiation exposure of 5 cal/cm^2, which is a common threshold for causing third-degree burns on exposed skin.\n\nR = ((1000)^2/3 * 0.35 / 5)^1/2\n\nR â‰ˆ 8.1 km\n\nThe thermal radiation radius for a 1-megaton nuclear weapon is approximately 8.1 kilometers, where people within this radius would likely experience third-degree burns on exposed skin. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and various factors such as weather conditions, altitude of the explosion, and the presence of structures can influence the actual thermal radiation radius."
