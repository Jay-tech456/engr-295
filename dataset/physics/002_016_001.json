Please solve for the critical temperature in Kelvin.",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical temperature of a substance, we can use the Van der Waals equation of state for real gases. The critical constants (critical temperature Tc, critical pressure Pc, and critical volume Vc) are related to the Van der Waals constants \"a\" and \"b\" as follows:\n\nTc = (8 * a) / (27 * R * b)\nPc = (a) / (27 * b^2)\nVc = 3 * b\n\nWe are given the critical pressure Pc = 50 atm and the critical volume Vc = 100 L. We also know the Van der Waals constants \"a\" = 3.5 atm L^2/mol^2 and \"b\" = 0.05 L/mol. The gas constant R = 0.0821 L atm / (K mol).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles (n) using the critical volume and the constant \"b\":\n\nVc = 3 * b\n100 L = 3 * 0.05 L/mol\nn = 100 L / (3 * 0.05 L/mol) = 666.67 mol\n\nNow, we can use the critical pressure equation to find the constant \"a\":\n\nPc = (a) / (27 * b^2)\n50 atm = (3.5 atm L^2/mol^2) / (27 * (0.05 L/mol)^2)\n50 atm = (3.5 atm L^2/mol^2) / (27 * 0.0025 L^2/mol^2)\na = 50 atm * 27 * 0.0025 L^2/mol^2 = 3.375 atm L^2/mol^2\n\nNow we can use the critical temperature equation to find Tc:\n\nTc = (8 * a) / (27 * R * b)\nTc = (8 * 3.375 atm L^2/mol^2) / (27 * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 0.05 L/mol)\nTc = 27 K\n\nThe critical temperature of the substance is 27 Kelvin."
