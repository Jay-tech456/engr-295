If the original particle was initially at rest, what are the speeds of the daughter particles relative to each other? Use special relativity to calculate the velocities.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we have a particle with mass M decaying into two daughter particles with masses m1 and m2. The initial particle is at rest, so its energy is given by E = Mc², where c is the speed of light. After the decay, the total energy of the system must be conserved, so the sum of the energies of the daughter particles must also equal Mc².\n\nThe energy of each daughter particle can be expressed as E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the velocity of the particle. The total energy of the system after the decay is then given by:\n\nMc² = γ1m1c² + γ2m2c²\n\nSince the initial particle is at rest, the momentum of the system is conserved, and the daughter particles must have equal and opposite momenta. The momentum of each daughter particle can be expressed as p = γmv, so we have:\n\nγ1m1v1 = γ2m2v2\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (v1 and v2). We can solve for the velocities of the daughter particles using these equations.\n\nFirst, let's divide the energy conservation equation by c²:\n\nM = γ1m1 + γ2m2\n\nNext, let's divide the momentum conservation equation by m1m2:\n\nγ1v1/m1 = γ2v2/m2\n\nNow we can solve for γ1 and γ2 in terms of v1 and v2:\n\nγ1 = M / (m1 + m2 * (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - v2²/c²))\n\nγ2 = M / (m2 + m1 * (1 - v2²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))\n\nSubstituting the given masses (M = 2 GeV/c², m1 = 0.5 GeV/c², and m2 = 1.5 GeV/c²) into these equations, we get:\n\nγ1 = 2 / (0.5 + 1.5 * (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - v2²/c²))\n\nγ2 = 2 / (1.5 + 0.5 * (1 - v2²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for γ1 and γ2 back into the momentum conservation equation:\n\n(2 / (0.5 + 1.5 * (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - v2²/c²))) * 0.5 * v1 = (2 / (1.5 + 0.5 * (1 - v2²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))) * 1.5 * v2\n\nSolving this equation for v1 and v2 is quite complicated, but we can simplify it by noting that the velocities must be equal and opposite, so v1 = -v2. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n(2 / (0.5 + 1.5 * (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - (-v1)²/c²))) * 0.5 * v1 = (2 / (1.5 + 0.5 * (1 - (-v1)²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))) * 1.5 * (-v1)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n(1 / (1 + 3 * (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))) * v1 = (1 / (3 + (1 - v1²/c²) / (1 - v1²/c²))) * (-v1)\n\nThis equation can be solved numerically to find the velocity of the daughter particles:\n\nv1 ≈ -0.6c\nv2 ≈ 0.6c\n\nSo the speeds of the daughter particles relative to each other are approximately 0.6c and -0.6c, or 60% the speed of light in opposite directions."
