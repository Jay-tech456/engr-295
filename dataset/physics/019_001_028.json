    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the scattering amplitude of a process is given by the S-matrix element, which can be calculated using Feynman diagrams. For Compton scattering, there are two relevant Feynman diagrams: one where the electron emits a photon before interacting with the other electron, and one where the electron absorbs a photon after interacting with the other electron.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for Compton scattering at an angle of 90 degrees can be calculated using the Mandelstam variables s, t, and u, which are functions of the energy and momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles. For a 90-degree scattering angle, the Mandelstam variables are:\n\ns = (p1 + k1)^2\nt = (p1 - p2)^2\nu = (p1 - k2)^2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the initial and final momenta of the electron, and k1 and k2 are the initial and final momenta of the photon.\n\nThe scattering amplitude M for Compton scattering can be expressed in terms of the fine-structure constant (α) and the Mandelstam variables:\n\nM = -e^2 (u/s + s/u)\n\nwhere e^2 = 4πα, and α ≈ 1/137.\n\nTo find the probability of the scattering process occurring, we need to square the scattering amplitude and integrate over the phase space of the final particles. The differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / 2π^2) (u^2 + s^2) / (s^2 * u^2)\n\nFor a 90-degree scattering angle, we can simplify this expression to:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / 2π^2) (1 + (s/u)^2) / (s * u)\n\nTo find the total probability, we need to integrate this expression over the solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫ dσ/dΩ dΩ\n\nThe result of this integration will depend on the specific energy and momentum of the incoming particles. In general, the probability of Compton scattering occurring will be small, as it is suppressed by the fine-structure constant."
