    "message_2": "The current estimate of the amount of dark energy present in the universe is approximately 68% of the total energy content. This value is derived from various observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nDark energy is believed to be the driving force behind the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but it is often described as a form of vacuum energy that permeates all of space. It has a negative pressure, which means that it has a repulsive effect on the fabric of spacetime.\n\nThe leading theoretical explanation for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which was first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. The cosmological constant represents a constant energy density that fills space homogeneously and contributes to the expansion of the universe.\n\nAs the universe expands, the density of matter (both ordinary and dark matter) decreases, while the density of dark energy remains constant. This causes the influence of dark energy to become more dominant over time, leading to an accelerating expansion of the universe. This acceleration has been confirmed by observations of distant supernovae, which show that the expansion rate of the universe is increasing with time.\n\nIn summary, dark energy is estimated to make up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe, and it is the primary cause of the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. However, the exact nature of dark energy and its underlying physical properties are still subjects of ongoing research and debate among physicists."
