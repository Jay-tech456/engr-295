    "message_2": "The probability of a tau lepton decaying into an electron-positron pair in a high-energy collision, given that lepton flavor violation occurs and the branching ratio of this decay mode is 0.178%, can be expressed as a decimal by dividing the branching ratio by 100.\n\nProbability = 0.178% / 100 = 0.00178\n\nSo, the probability of this decay mode occurring is 0.00178 or 0.178% in a high-energy collision."
