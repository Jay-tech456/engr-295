    "message_2": "To calculate the power required for ohmic heating in a plasma, we need to find the current flowing through the plasma and the resistance of the plasma. Then, we can use the formula P = I^2 * R, where P is the power, I is the current, and R is the resistance.\n\nFirst, let's find the resistance of the plasma using the formula R = ρ * (L / A), where R is the resistance, ρ is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nR = (2.5 x 10^-8 Ωm) * (2 m / 1 m^2)\nR = 5 x 10^-8 Ω\n\nNext, we need to find the current flowing through the plasma. We can use the formula I = n * e * A * v, where I is the current, n is the density of the plasma, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), A is the cross-sectional area, and v is the drift velocity of the electrons.\n\nTo find the drift velocity, we can use the formula v = (2 * k * T) / m, where v is the drift velocity, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and m is the mass of an electron (9.11 x 10^-31 kg). First, we need to convert the temperature from eV to Kelvin using the formula T(K) = T(eV) * e / k.\n\nT(K) = (10 eV) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K)\nT(K) = 1.16 x 10^5 K\n\nNow, we can find the drift velocity:\n\nv = (2 * 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K * 1.16 x 10^5 K) / (9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\nv = 3.5 x 10^5 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the current:\n\nI = (1.5 x 10^19 m^-3) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (1 m^2) * (3.5 x 10^5 m/s)\nI = 8.4 x 10^5 A\n\nFinally, we can find the power required for ohmic heating:\n\nP = I^2 * R\nP = (8.4 x 10^5 A)^2 * (5 x 10^-8 Ω)\nP = 3.53 x 10^14 W\n\nSo, the power required for ohmic heating in the plasma is 3.53 x 10^14 watts."
