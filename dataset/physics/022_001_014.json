    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation. There are several leading theories on the nature of dark matter particles, and various experiments have been designed to test or observe them. Some of the prominent theories include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through gravity and the weak nuclear force. WIMPs are expected to have masses in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton. Experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and direct detection experiments such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) and XENON1T aim to detect WIMPs through their interactions with ordinary matter.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are much lighter than WIMPs and interact very weakly with ordinary matter. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) are two experiments designed to detect axions, either by converting them into photons in a strong magnetic field or by observing their effects on the properties of other particles.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrino species. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the dark matter content. Experiments like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the MiniBooNE experiment are searching for sterile neutrinos by looking for anomalies in the behavior of ordinary neutrinos.\n\n4. Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM): This theory proposes that dark matter particles can interact with each other through a new force, in addition to gravity. This self-interaction could help explain some discrepancies in the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. Experiments like the LHC and the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) could potentially discover new particles or forces associated with SIDM.\n\n5. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs): PBHs are black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could range in size from much smaller than a proton to several solar masses. While not composed of particles, PBHs could still contribute to the dark matter content of the universe. Observations of gravitational waves, such as those made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), could provide evidence for the existence of PBHs.\n\nThese theories are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible that dark matter is composed of a combination of different particles or phenomena. As experiments continue to refine their sensitivity and explore new regions of parameter space, we may eventually uncover the true nature of dark matter."
