    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of the excited state of the hydrogen atom, we first need to determine the energy of the emitted photon. We can do this using the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n\nEnergy difference (ΔE) = E_excited - E_ground = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nNow, we need to convert the energy difference to joules:\n\nΔE (in joules) = 10.2 eV * (1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV) = 1.632 * 10^(-18) J\n\nNext, we can use the wavelength of the emitted photon (656 nm) to find its frequency (ν) using the speed of light (c):\n\nν = c / λ = (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (656 * 10^(-9) m) = 4.573 * 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can use the energy of the photon (ΔE) and its frequency (ν) to find the lifetime (τ) of the excited state using the following relation:\n\nΔE = h * ν\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 * 10^(-34) Js).\n\nτ = h / ΔE = (6.626 * 10^(-34) Js) / (1.632 * 10^(-18) J) = 4.06 * 10^(-16) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state of the hydrogen atom (n = 2) is approximately 4.06 * 10^(-16) seconds."
