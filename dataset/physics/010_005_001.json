If the fluid is moving at a velocity of 2 m/s, determine the magnitude of drag force and lift force acting on the plate, assuming that the plate is resting on a smooth surface and there is zero pressure difference between the two sides of the plate.",
    "message_2": "To determine the drag force acting on the plate, we can use the drag force equation:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * ρ * v^2 * A * C_D\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, ρ is the fluid density, v is the fluid velocity, A is the area of the plate, and C_D is the drag coefficient. Since the plate is perpendicular to the flow, the drag coefficient for a flat plate is approximately 2.0.\n\nThe area of the plate (A) can be calculated as:\n\nA = width * height = 0.3 m * 0.4 m = 0.12 m²\n\nNow we can calculate the drag force:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * 1000 kg/m³ * (2 m/s)^2 * 0.12 m² * 2.0\nF_D = 480 N\n\nThe drag force acting on the plate is 480 N.\n\nAs for the lift force, since there is zero pressure difference between the two sides of the plate and it is resting on a smooth surface, there is no lift force acting on the plate. Therefore, the lift force is 0 N."
