    "message_2": "To initiate a fusion reaction in a plasma containing deuterium and tritium, the temperature must be high enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. This temperature is typically referred to as the ignition temperature.\n\nFor deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion, the minimum temperature required is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 x 10^6 K). At this temperature, the kinetic energy of the particles is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb barrier, allowing the nuclei to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together and initiate the fusion reaction."
