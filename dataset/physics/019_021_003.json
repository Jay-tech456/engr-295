    "message_2": "In the framework of string theory, the scattering of two closed strings in the first order of perturbation theory can be calculated using the tools of quantum field theory, specifically through the use of string amplitudes. The first order of perturbation theory corresponds to the tree-level diagrams in string theory, which are represented by the so-called \"worldsheet\" diagrams.\n\nThe calculation involves the evaluation of the string amplitude, which is given by the integral over the moduli space of the worldsheet with the insertion of vertex operators representing the initial and final states of the strings. For the scattering of two closed strings, the relevant worldsheet diagram is the sphere with four punctures, corresponding to the four vertex operators.\n\nThe string amplitude can be written as:\n\nA = ∫ d²z₁ d²z₂ d²z₃ d²z₄ V₁(z₁) V₂(z₂) V₃(z₃) V₄(z₄) exp(-k₁·k₂ G(z₁, z₂) - k₁·k₃ G(z₁, z₃) - k₁·k₄ G(z₁, z₄) - k₂·k₃ G(z₂, z₃) - k₂·k₄ G(z₂, z₄) - k₃·k₄ G(z₃, z₄))\n\nHere, the integral is over the positions of the vertex operators (z₁, z₂, z₃, z₄) on the worldsheet, Vᵢ(zᵢ) are the vertex operators representing the initial and final states of the strings, kᵢ are the momenta of the strings, and G(zᵢ, zⱼ) is the Green's function on the worldsheet.\n\nThe physical interpretation of the various terms in the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. The vertex operators Vᵢ(zᵢ) represent the initial and final states of the strings. They encode the quantum numbers of the strings, such as their momenta and internal degrees of freedom.\n\n2. The Green's function G(zᵢ, zⱼ) encodes the propagation of the strings on the worldsheet. It describes how the strings interact with each other through the exchange of closed string states.\n\n3. The exponential term in the amplitude represents the interaction between the strings. The terms kᵢ·kⱼ G(zᵢ, zⱼ) describe the interaction between strings i and j, with their momenta kᵢ and kⱼ.\n\n4. The integral over the moduli space of the worldsheet takes into account the different ways the strings can interact on the worldsheet. This integral is crucial for obtaining the correct scattering amplitude in string theory and ensures that the amplitude is invariant under the symmetries of the worldsheet.\n\nIn summary, the calculation for the scattering of two closed strings in the first order of perturbation theory in string theory involves the evaluation of the string amplitude, which is given by the integral over the moduli space of the worldsheet with the insertion of vertex operators. The various terms in the calculation have physical interpretations related to the initial and final states of the strings, their propagation on the worldsheet, and their interactions with each other."
