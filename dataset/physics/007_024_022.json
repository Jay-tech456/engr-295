    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required for nuclear fusion to occur in hydrogen plasma is around 10 million Kelvin (10 MK or approximately 10^7 K). At this temperature, hydrogen nuclei (protons) have enough kinetic energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them and come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together, resulting in nuclear fusion.\n\nThe main method of confinement used in practical nuclear fusion reactors is magnetic confinement. This approach uses strong magnetic fields to confine and control the hot plasma, preventing it from coming into contact with the reactor walls and losing energy. The most common magnetic confinement devices are tokamaks and stellarators. Another approach to nuclear fusion is inertial confinement, which uses high-energy lasers or particle beams to compress and heat a small fuel pellet, inducing fusion reactions. However, magnetic confinement is currently the most advanced and widely studied method for practical nuclear fusion reactors."
