    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is the remnant thermal radiation from the early universe, dating back to around 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It is a crucial piece of evidence for the Big Bang theory and provides valuable information about the structure, composition, and evolution of the universe.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB is remarkably uniform across the sky, with an average value of approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K). This value was measured with high precision by the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite in the early 1990s and has been confirmed by subsequent experiments, such as the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) and Planck satellite missions.\n\nDespite its overall uniformity, the CMB temperature exhibits small fluctuations or anisotropies at the level of about 1 part in 100,000. These tiny temperature variations are believed to be the seeds of the large-scale structure we observe in the universe today, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The observed temperature pattern can be analyzed to extract information about the structure, composition, and evolution of the universe.\n\n1. Structure: The CMB anisotropies reveal the distribution of matter and energy in the early universe. The pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the predictions of the inflationary Big Bang model, which posits a brief period of rapid expansion in the early universe. This supports the idea that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.\n\n2. Composition: By analyzing the CMB anisotropies, we can determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter (baryons), dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. Current measurements indicate that the universe is composed of roughly 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n3. Evolution: The CMB anisotropies also provide information about the age and expansion rate of the universe. By studying the pattern of fluctuations, we can determine the Hubble constant, which describes the expansion rate of the universe. This, in turn, allows us to estimate the age of the universe, which is currently estimated to be around 13.8 billion years.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 2.725 K, with small fluctuations across the sky. These fluctuations provide crucial information about the structure, composition, and evolution of the universe, supporting the inflationary Big Bang model and helping us understand the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe."
