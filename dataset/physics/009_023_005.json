    "message_1": "A physics student is using a polarizing filter to analyze the light intensity of a beam of light. The first polarizer is set at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal and the second polarizer has its axis perpendicular to the first one. If the initial intensity of the light beam is 10 W/m², determine the intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer. Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light after passing through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the final intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizers.\n\nIn this case, the initial intensity I₀ is 10 W/m², and the angle θ between the polarizers is 90° (since the second polarizer is perpendicular to the first one).\n\nLet's calculate the final intensity:\n\nI = 10 * cos²(90°)\n\nSince cos(90°) = 0, we have:\n\nI = 10 * 0²\nI = 10 * 0\nI = 0 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer is 0 W/m²."
