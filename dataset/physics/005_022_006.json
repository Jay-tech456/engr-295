    "message_2": "First, let's find the relativistic mass of the particle. The relativistic mass (m) is given by the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nm = (1 x 10^-26 kg) / sqrt(1 - (0.98c)^2/c^2)\nm = (1 x 10^-26 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.98^2)\nm = (1 x 10^-26 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.9604)\nm = (1 x 10^-26 kg) / sqrt(0.0396)\nm = (1 x 10^-26 kg) / 0.199\n\nm ≈ 5.03 x 10^-26 kg\n\nNow, let's find the kinetic energy (K) of the particle. The kinetic energy is given by the equation:\n\nK = (m - m0) * c^2\n\nK = (5.03 x 10^-26 kg - 1 x 10^-26 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK = (4.03 x 10^-26 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nK ≈ 3.63 x 10^-9 J\n\nNow, let's find the electric field strength (E) required to accelerate the particle. The work done (W) on the particle by the electric field is equal to the kinetic energy of the particle:\n\nW = K = q * E * d\n\nwhere q is the charge of the particle, E is the electric field strength, and d is the distance over which the particle is accelerated. We are not given the charge of the particle, so we cannot find the exact electric field strength. However, we can find the electric field strength in terms of the charge:\n\nE = K / (q * d)\n\nWithout knowing the charge (q) and the distance (d) over which the particle is accelerated, we cannot find the exact value of the electric field strength. However, we have found the kinetic energy of the particle to be approximately 3.63 x 10^-9 J."
