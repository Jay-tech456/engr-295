    "message_2": "In a monolayer graphene sheet, the electrical conductivity (σ) is primarily determined by the charge carrier concentration (n) and the carrier mobility (μ). The relationship between conductivity and these parameters is given by:\n\nσ = e * n * μ\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 C).\n\nThe temperature dependence of electrical conductivity in graphene is mainly due to the temperature dependence of carrier mobility. In general, the carrier mobility decreases with increasing temperature due to increased scattering of charge carriers by lattice vibrations (phonons) and other scattering mechanisms.\n\nFor monolayer graphene, the temperature dependence of carrier mobility can be described by the following empirical formula:\n\nμ(T) = μ(0) / (1 + α * T)\n\nwhere μ(0) is the carrier mobility at 0 K, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and α is a temperature coefficient that depends on the specific sample and its impurities.\n\nThe charge carrier concentration in graphene is relatively insensitive to temperature, especially in the case of highly doped graphene. Therefore, the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity in monolayer graphene can be approximated as:\n\nσ(T) = σ(0) / (1 + α * T)\n\nwhere σ(0) is the electrical conductivity at 0 K.\n\nIn summary, the electrical conductivity of a monolayer graphene sheet generally decreases with increasing temperature due to the reduction in carrier mobility caused by increased scattering from lattice vibrations and other mechanisms. The exact relationship between conductivity and temperature depends on the specific sample and its impurities."
