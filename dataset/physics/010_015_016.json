    "message_1": "A water pump designed to deliver 10 liters of water per second is experiencing failure due to cavitation. Determine the minimum inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation from occurring inside the pump. Assume the temperature of the water to be 20°C and that the inlet pipe of the pump is located at a depth of 5 meters below the water surface.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation, we need to consider the vapor pressure of water at the given temperature and the hydrostatic pressure at the depth of the inlet pipe.\n\n1. Vapor pressure of water at 20°C:\nThe vapor pressure of water at 20°C is approximately 2.34 kPa.\n\n2. Hydrostatic pressure at a depth of 5 meters:\nTo calculate the hydrostatic pressure, we can use the formula:\n\nP_hydrostatic = ρ * g * h\n\nwhere:\nρ is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m³ at 20°C)\ng is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nh is the depth below the water surface (5 meters)\n\nP_hydrostatic = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 5 m = 49050 Pa = 49.05 kPa\n\n3. Minimum inlet pressure:\nTo prevent cavitation, the inlet pressure must be greater than the sum of the vapor pressure and the hydrostatic pressure.\n\nP_min = P_vapor + P_hydrostatic\nP_min = 2.34 kPa + 49.05 kPa = 51.39 kPa\n\nTherefore, the minimum inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation is 51.39 kPa."
