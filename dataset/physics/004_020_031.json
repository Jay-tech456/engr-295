    "message_2": "To determine the expected frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted from a binary system consisting of two neutron stars with masses of 1.4 solar masses each in a tightly orbiting configuration, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f):\nf = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (fgw):\nfgw = 2 * f\n\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h):\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * a)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance between the binary system and the observer.\n\nHowever, we need more information about the semi-major axis (a) to calculate the exact values of frequency and amplitude. Assuming we have the value of a, we can calculate the frequency and amplitude using the above formulas.\n\nTo infer the distance between the binary system and the observer, we can use the gravitational wave amplitude formula (h). If we measure the amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) and know the masses of the neutron stars (M1 and M2) and the semi-major axis (a), we can rearrange the formula to solve for the distance (r):\n\nr = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * h * a)\n\nBy measuring the gravitational wave amplitude and knowing the properties of the binary system, we can estimate the distance between the binary system and the observer."
