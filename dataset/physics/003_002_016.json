    "message_1": "A solenoid has 200 turns per meter and a length of 0.5m. If the current flowing through the solenoid is 2A, what is the magnetic field inside the solenoid?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nn = 200 turns/m\nI = 2 A\nμ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (200 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (400 turns*m⁻¹*A)\n\nB = 1.6π × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nB ≈ 5.027 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 5.027 × 10⁻⁴ T (tesla)."
