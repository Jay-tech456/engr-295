    "message_1": "Calculate the electrical conductivity of a copper wire with a length of 2 m and a cross-sectional area of 2 mm². Assume that the wire follows Ohm's law and has a resistivity of 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm at room temperature. If a potential difference of 5 V is applied across the wire, what is the current flowing through it?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) of the copper wire. Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity (ρ). So, σ = 1/ρ.\n\nGiven the resistivity of copper (ρ) = 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm, we can calculate the electrical conductivity:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm) ≈ 5.95 × 10⁷ S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the resistance (R) of the wire using the formula:\n\nR = ρ × (L / A)\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire (2 m) and A is the cross-sectional area (2 mm²). First, we need to convert the cross-sectional area from mm² to m²:\n\n2 mm² = 2 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm) × (2 m / 2 × 10⁻⁶ m²) ≈ 0.0168 Ω\n\nFinally, we can use Ohm's law to calculate the current (I) flowing through the wire when a potential difference of 5 V is applied:\n\nI = V / R\n\nwhere V is the potential difference (5 V) and R is the resistance (0.0168 Ω):\n\nI = 5 V / 0.0168 Ω ≈ 297.62 A\n\nSo, the current flowing through the copper wire is approximately 297.62 A."
