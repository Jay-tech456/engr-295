The block is then transferred to a room maintained at 25°C, and it cools down to 22°C in 20 minutes. Determine the rate of heat transfer during the heating process and the cooling process.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the amount of heat transferred to the block during the heating process. We are given the power of the electric heater (100W) and the time it is used (10 minutes).\n\nPower = Energy / Time\nEnergy = Power × Time\n\nEnergy = 100 W × 10 minutes × (60 seconds/minute) = 60000 J\n\nNow, let's find the final temperature of the block after the heating process. We can use the specific heat capacity formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass of the block, c is the specific heat capacity of iron, and ΔT is the change in temperature. The specific heat capacity of iron is 450 J/kg°C.\n\n60000 J = (0.5 kg)(450 J/kg°C)(T_final - 20°C)\n\nSolving for T_final:\n\nT_final = (60000 J / (0.5 kg × 450 J/kg°C)) + 20°C = 266.67°C\n\nNow, let's find the amount of heat transferred during the cooling process. We know that the block cools down from 266.67°C to 22°C in 20 minutes.\n\nΔT = T_initial - T_final = 266.67°C - 22°C = 244.67°C\n\nUsing the specific heat capacity formula again:\n\nQ = mcΔT\nQ = (0.5 kg)(450 J/kg°C)(244.67°C) = 55050.75 J\n\nSince the cooling process takes 20 minutes, we can find the rate of heat transfer:\n\nRate of heat transfer = Energy / Time\nRate of heat transfer = 55050.75 J / (20 minutes × 60 seconds/minute) = 45.88 W\n\nSo, the rate of heat transfer during the heating process is 100 W, and the rate of heat transfer during the cooling process is 45.88 W."
