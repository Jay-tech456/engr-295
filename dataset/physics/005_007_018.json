    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a speed of 0.9c for 10 years according to its clock. Meanwhile, its identical twin sibling stays on Earth. How much time has passed on Earth when the spaceship returns, as measured by the Earth’s clock? What is the age difference between the twins, and how can this be explained by the twin paradox?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. In this case, the spaceship is moving at 0.9c relative to Earth.\n\nThe time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time interval measured by the Earth's clock (the observer), Δt0 is the time interval measured by the spaceship's clock (the moving object), v is the relative velocity (0.9c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the spaceship's clock measures a time interval of 10 years, we can calculate the time interval measured by the Earth's clock:\n\nΔt = 10 years / √(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nΔt = 10 years / √(1 - 0.81)\nΔt = 10 years / √0.19\nΔt ≈ 22.91 years\n\nSo, 22.91 years have passed on Earth when the spaceship returns, as measured by the Earth's clock. Since the spaceship's clock measures 10 years, the age difference between the twins is:\n\nAge difference = 22.91 years - 10 years = 12.91 years\n\nThe twin paradox can be explained by the fact that the twin on the spaceship is in a non-inertial frame of reference, as they have to accelerate to reach the speed of 0.9c and decelerate to return to Earth. This acceleration and deceleration cause the twin on the spaceship to experience time dilation, making their clock run slower relative to the Earth's clock. As a result, the twin on the spaceship ages less than the twin on Earth, leading to the age difference of 12.91 years."
