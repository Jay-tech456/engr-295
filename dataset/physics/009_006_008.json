    "message_2": "To determine the magnification and the position of the image, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nMagnification formula:\nM = -di/do = hi/ho\n\nWhere M is the magnification, di is the image distance, do is the object distance, hi is the image height, and ho is the object height.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\ndo = 30 cm\nho = 4 cm\n\nFirst, we'll find the image distance (di) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator (30):\n\n2/30 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find di:\n\ndi = 30 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -di/do = hi/ho\nM = -30/30 = hi/4\n\nSimplify:\n\nM = -1 = hi/4\n\nNow, we can find the image height (hi):\n\nhi = -1 * 4\nhi = -4 cm\n\nThe magnification is -1, and the image is 4 cm tall and located 30 cm in front of the mirror. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
