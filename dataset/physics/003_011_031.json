    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop and integrate over the entire disc.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying circular loop of radius r and current I at a point on its axis at a distance x from the center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * r²) / (2 * (x² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, we can consider an infinitesimally small circular loop of radius r and thickness dr within the disc. The current in this small loop (dI) can be calculated as follows:\n\ndI = (I * 2π * r * dr) / (π * R²)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the entire disc (5 cm).\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB due to this small loop at the given point:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI * r²) / (2 * (x² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nSubstituting the expression for dI:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * r³ * dr) / (R² * (x² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = R) to find the total magnetic field at the given point:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * r³ * dr) / (R² * (x² + r²)^(3/2)) from r = 0 to r = R\n\nLet's plug in the given values: R = 5 cm, I = 2 A, x = 10 cm, and μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB = ∫(4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * r³ * dr) / (25 * (100 + r²)^(3/2)) from r = 0 to r = 5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use numerical integration methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. Using a numerical integration calculator, we get:\n\nB ≈ 2.52 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, 10 cm away from its center, is approximately 2.52 × 10^(-7) T."
