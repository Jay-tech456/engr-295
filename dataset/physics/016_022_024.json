    "message_2": "Determining the exact critical transition temperature (Tc) and critical magnetic field (Hc) of a specific superconducting alloy requires experimental data, as these properties depend on the detailed microstructure and composition of the alloy. However, we can provide some general trends and estimations based on the properties of the individual elements and their alloys.\n\nFor the given alloy composition (60% niobium, 5% titanium, and 35% tin), we can consider the following properties of the individual elements:\n\n1. Niobium (Nb): Tc ≈ 9.2 K, Hc ≈ 0.2 T (Tesla)\n2. Titanium (Ti): Tc ≈ 0.4 K, Hc ≈ 0.01 T\n3. Tin (Sn): Tc ≈ 3.7 K, Hc ≈ 0.03 T\n\nSince the alloy is primarily composed of niobium, we can expect the critical transition temperature and critical magnetic field to be closer to those of niobium. However, the presence of titanium and tin will likely reduce the Tc and Hc compared to pure niobium. The exact values would require experimental measurements.\n\nAs for the effect of varying composition percentages, we can make some general observations:\n\n1. Increasing the percentage of niobium would likely increase both Tc and Hc, as niobium has the highest Tc and Hc among the three elements.\n2. Increasing the percentage of titanium would likely decrease both Tc and Hc, as titanium has the lowest Tc and Hc among the three elements.\n3. Increasing the percentage of tin would have a more complex effect on Tc and Hc, as it has intermediate values for both properties. The exact effect would depend on the specific alloy composition and microstructure.\n\nIn summary, the exact critical transition temperature and critical magnetic field of the given superconducting alloy would require experimental data. However, we can expect the values to be closer to those of niobium, with some reduction due to the presence of titanium and tin. The effect of varying composition percentages would depend on the specific alloy composition and microstructure."
