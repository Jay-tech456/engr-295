    "message_2": "The current understanding of the amount and distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the observable universe is based on various observations and measurements, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy clustering, and supernovae data. According to the latest results from the Planck satellite mission, the composition of the universe is approximately 68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter (baryonic matter).\n\nDark matter is believed to be distributed in a web-like structure, with filaments connecting galaxy clusters and forming the cosmic web. It is not evenly distributed throughout the universe. Dark matter cannot be directly observed, as it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and gravitational lensing.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is even more mysterious. It is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Unlike dark matter, dark energy is thought to be uniformly distributed throughout the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, and it remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in modern physics.\n\nBoth dark matter and dark energy have significant impacts on the overall structure and evolution of the universe:\n\n1. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures. Its gravitational influence causes ordinary matter to clump together and form galaxies. Without dark matter, it would be challenging to explain the observed distribution of galaxies and the cosmic web structure.\n\n2. Dark energy affects the expansion rate of the universe. The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe in the late 1990s led to the hypothesis of dark energy. This accelerated expansion counteracts the attractive force of gravity, preventing the universe from collapsing back on itself. The balance between dark energy and gravity will determine the ultimate fate of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter and dark energy are essential components of our current understanding of the universe. They play crucial roles in shaping the large-scale structure and the evolution of the universe. However, their exact nature remains elusive, and further research is needed to uncover their fundamental properties and origins."
