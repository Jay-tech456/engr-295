    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the wire is infinitely long, we can use Ampere's Law to simplify the calculation. The formula for the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a current I at a perpendicular distance r from the wire is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 4 A, and the distance r is 5 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 5 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 * 10^(-7) Tm * 4 A) / (2 * 5 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (16 * 10^(-7) T) / 10 m\n\nB = 1.6 * 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced by the wire at a point on the y-axis located at y = 5 m is 1.6 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
