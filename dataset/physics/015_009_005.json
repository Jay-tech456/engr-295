    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which relates the orbital period of two objects to their distance and masses. The formula for the orbital period (T) is:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere:\n- T is the orbital period\n- a is the distance between the two objects (in this case, the binary neutron star system)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects (in this case, the neutron stars)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to SI units. The combined mass of the binary neutron star system is 2.9 solar masses. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM_total = 2.9 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 5.7671 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe distance between the two neutron stars is given as 300 km, which is:\n\na = 300 km * (1000 m/km) = 3 x 10^5 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into Kepler's third law formula:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * (3 x 10^5 m)^3) / (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.7671 x 10^30 kg)\n\nT^2 ≈ 1.282 x 10^11 s^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nT ≈ 3.582 x 10^5 s\n\nNow, we need to find the time between two consecutive peaks of the waveform of gravitational waves. The waveform period is half of the orbital period since the waveform has two peaks per orbit (one for each neutron star):\n\nt_peak = T / 2 ≈ 3.582 x 10^5 s / 2 ≈ 1.791 x 10^5 s\n\nSo, the time between two consecutive peaks of the waveform of gravitational waves emitted by this binary neutron star system is approximately 1.791 x 10^5 seconds."
