    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of electromagnetic radiation that will cause a transition between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom under the influence of a magnetic field, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nν = γ * B / (2 * π)\n\nwhere ν is the frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (for hydrogen, γ = 42.577 MHz/T), and B is the magnetic field strength (1.5 T in this case).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nν = (42.577 MHz/T) * (1.5 T) / (2 * π)\n\nν ≈ 10.2 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of electromagnetic radiation that will cause a transition between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom under a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T is approximately 10.2 MHz. This is the frequency required to detect the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect in the hydrogen atom."
