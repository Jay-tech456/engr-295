    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a proton after being accelerated to 99.9% of the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass of the proton (1.67 x 10^-27 kg), c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the velocity of the proton (0.999c).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the velocity of the proton:\n\nv = 0.999c = 0.999 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 2.997 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy:\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(1 - (2.997 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(1 - 0.999^2)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(1 - 0.998001)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / sqrt(0.001999)\n\nE = (1.67 x 10^-27 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / 0.0447\n\nE â‰ˆ 3.37 x 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the energy of the proton after being accelerated to 99.9% of the speed of light is approximately 3.37 x 10^-10 Joules."
