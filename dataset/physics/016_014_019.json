    "message_2": "To determine the critical magnetic field of a superconducting magnet, we can use the formula for the temperature dependence of the critical magnetic field:\n\nH_c(T) = H_c(0) * (1 - (T/T_c)^2)\n\nwhere H_c(T) is the critical magnetic field at temperature T, H_c(0) is the critical magnetic field at 0 K, T is the temperature, and T_c is the critical temperature.\n\nGiven the critical temperature T_c = 10 K and the critical magnetic field H_c(0) = 14 T, we can calculate the critical magnetic field at different temperatures.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical magnetic field at 10 K:\n\nH_c(10) = 14 T * (1 - (10/10)^2) = 14 T * (1 - 1) = 0 T\n\nAs expected, the critical magnetic field is 0 T at the critical temperature.\n\nNow, let's find the critical magnetic field at 5 K:\n\nH_c(5) = 14 T * (1 - (5/10)^2) = 14 T * (1 - 0.25) = 14 T * 0.75 = 10.5 T\n\nSo, the critical magnetic field of the NbTi superconducting magnet at 5 K is 10.5 T."
