    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the axis of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a long, thin cylindrical wire, the magnetic field (B) is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (4 cm in this case) centered on the wire as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field is constant along this loop, so we can write:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the loop of radius 4 cm. Since the wire has a radius of 2 cm and carries a current of 5 A, the current density (J) is uniform across the wire's cross-sectional area. We can calculate the current density as follows:\n\nJ = I / A\nJ = 5 A / (π * (0.02 m)^2)\nJ ≈ 3978.87 A/m²\n\nNow, we need to find the enclosed current within the loop of radius 4 cm. The enclosed area is a circle with a radius of 0.04 m:\n\nA_enclosed = π * (0.04 m)^2\nA_enclosed ≈ 0.005027 m²\n\nThe enclosed current (I_enclosed) can be calculated as:\n\nI_enclosed = J * A_enclosed\nI_enclosed ≈ 3978.87 A/m² * 0.005027 m²\nI_enclosed ≈ 20 A\n\nNow we can find the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 4 cm (0.04 m) from the axis of the wire using Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2π(0.04 m) = μ₀ * 20 A\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nB * 2π(0.04 m) = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 A\n\nDivide both sides by 2π(0.04 m):\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 A) / (2π(0.04 m))\nB ≈ 1 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the axis of the wire is approximately 1 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
