    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two neutron stars, we need to know the masses of the neutron stars and the distance between them. However, since this information is not provided, we can only give a rough estimate based on typical values for neutron star masses and their separation during the merger.\n\nNeutron stars typically have masses around 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun). Let's assume both neutron stars have this mass. The frequency of the gravitational waves during the late inspiral phase (just before the merger) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * (M1 + M2) / (M1 * M2)))^(3/8) * (1 / pi * (G * (M1 + M2) / c^3))^(5/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars, and pi is the mathematical constant.\n\nUsing the values M1 = M2 = 1.4 M_sun, G = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, and c = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf ≈ 1570 Hz\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected amplitude of these gravitational waves on Earth. The amplitude of gravitational waves decreases with distance, and it can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f)^(-2/3)) / (c^2 * d)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system (a combination of the masses of the two neutron stars), and d is the distance to the source.\n\nThe chirp mass can be calculated as:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nUsing the values M1 = M2 = 1.4 M_sun, we get:\n\nM_chirp ≈ 1.2 M_sun\n\nNow, we need to convert the distance from light-years to meters. The distance is given as 1.3 billion light-years, which is approximately 1.3 × 10^9 light-years. One light-year is approximately 9.461 × 10^15 meters, so the distance in meters is:\n\nd ≈ 1.3 × 10^9 * 9.461 × 10^15 ≈ 1.23 × 10^25 meters\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nh ≈ (4 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 * 1.2 * 1.989 × 10^30 * (pi * 1570)^(-2/3)) / (2.998 × 10^8)^2 * 1.23 × 10^25 ≈ 1.3 × 10^-22\n\nSo, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves on Earth is approximately 1.3 × 10^-22. Keep in mind that these values are rough estimates and depend on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbit."
