    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to calculate the electric field at the event horizon of a charged black hole with mass M and charge Q, using the Reissner-Nordström metric. Additionally, the student should analyze the behavior of the electric field as the charge of the black hole approaches the extremal limit.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the electric field at the event horizon of a charged black hole with mass M and charge Q, we first need to understand the Reissner-Nordström metric. The Reissner-Nordström metric is given by:\n\nds² = -f(r)dt² + f(r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere f(r) = 1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r², G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe event horizon is the boundary of the black hole from which nothing can escape, including light. For a Reissner-Nordström black hole, there are two event horizons, the outer event horizon r+ and the inner event horizon r-. The outer event horizon r+ is given by:\n\nr+ = GM/c² + √((GM/c²)² - GQ²/c⁴)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the electric field at the event horizon. The electric field E can be calculated using Gauss's law:\n\nE = Q/(4πε₀r²)\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nAt the event horizon r = r+, so the electric field E at the event horizon is:\n\nE = Q/(4πε₀r+²)\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the electric field as the charge of the black hole approaches the extremal limit. The extremal limit is when the black hole's charge is equal to its mass in geometrized units (Q = M), or:\n\nQ = GM/c²\n\nIn this case, the outer event horizon r+ becomes:\n\nr+ = GM/c²\n\nThe electric field at the event horizon in the extremal limit is:\n\nE_extremal = Q/(4πε₀(GM/c²)²)\n\nAs the charge of the black hole approaches the extremal limit, the electric field at the event horizon increases. In the extremal limit, the electric field becomes very strong and the black hole transitions to an extremal black hole with a single degenerate event horizon."
