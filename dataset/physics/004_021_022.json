    "message_2": "The mass of a star plays a crucial role in determining its ultimate fate, including whether it will undergo gravitational collapse and potentially become a black hole. To understand this, we need to consider the balance between the gravitational force and the internal pressure of the star.\n\nThe gravitational force acting on a mass element within the star is given by:\n\nF_gravity = G * (M_r * m) / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_r is the mass enclosed within a radius r, m is the mass element, and r is the distance from the center of the star.\n\nThe internal pressure of the star, which counteracts the gravitational force, is mainly due to the thermal pressure from nuclear fusion reactions in the core. The hydrostatic equilibrium condition states that the gravitational force must be balanced by the pressure gradient force:\n\ndP/dr = - G * M_r * ρ / r^2\n\nwhere P is the pressure and ρ is the density of the star.\n\nWhen a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the balance between gravity and pressure is disrupted. If the star's mass is below a certain threshold, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, it will collapse into a white dwarf or a neutron star. If the mass is above the TOV limit, the star will continue to collapse under its own gravity and potentially form a black hole.\n\nThe TOV limit is approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun):\n\nM_TOV ≈ 3 M_sun\n\nTo determine the likelihood of a star becoming a black hole, we can compare its mass to the TOV limit. If the mass of the star (M_star) is greater than the TOV limit, it has a higher likelihood of becoming a black hole:\n\nM_star > M_TOV\n\nFor example, if we have a star with a mass of 5 M_sun, we can compare it to the TOV limit:\n\n5 M_sun > 3 M_sun\n\nSince the mass of the star is greater than the TOV limit, it has a higher likelihood of becoming a black hole after its nuclear fuel is exhausted and it undergoes gravitational collapse.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a star is a critical factor in determining its likelihood of undergoing gravitational collapse and becoming a black hole. Stars with masses above the TOV limit (approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun) have a higher likelihood of becoming black holes."
