    "message_1": "What is the probability that a WIMP from the hypothetical dark matter halo surrounding our galaxy will interact with a nucleus in a detector made of Germanium? Calculate the expected signal rate and the background rate per kilogram of Germanium per year assuming a WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c² and a cross section of 10⁻⁴ pb. Additionally, calculate the minimum exposure of the detector required to detect a WIMP signal with a significance of 5σ.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a WIMP interacting with a nucleus in a Germanium detector, we need to consider the WIMP-nucleon cross-section, the local dark matter density, the velocity distribution of WIMPs, and the mass of the detector.\n\nLet's assume the following values:\n- WIMP mass (m_WIMP) = 50 GeV/c²\n- WIMP-nucleon cross-section (σ) = 10⁻⁴ pb = 10⁻⁴ * 10⁻³⁶ cm²\n- Local dark matter density (ρ) = 0.3 GeV/cm³\n- Average WIMP velocity (v) = 220 km/s = 2.2 * 10⁵ cm/s\n- Germanium nucleus mass (m_Ge) = 72.63 GeV/c² (natural abundance-weighted average)\n\nThe expected signal rate (R) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nR = (ρ * σ * v) / (m_WIMP * m_Ge)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nR = (0.3 * 10⁻⁴ * 10⁻³⁶ * 2.2 * 10⁵) / (50 * 72.63)\nR ≈ 2.16 * 10⁻³ events/kg/year\n\nNow, let's assume a background rate (B) of 1 event/kg/year (this is an assumption, as the actual background rate depends on the specific experimental setup and shielding).\n\nTo detect a WIMP signal with a significance of 5σ, we need to calculate the minimum exposure (E) of the detector. The significance (S) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nS = (R * E) / sqrt(R * E + B * E)\n\nFor a 5σ significance:\n\n5 = (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E) / sqrt(2.16 * 10⁻³ * E + E)\n25 = (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E)² / (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E + E)\n25 * (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E + E) = (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E)²\n25 * (2.16 * 10⁻³ * E + E) = 4.6656 * 10⁻⁶ * E²\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE ≈ 2300 kg*year\n\nSo, the minimum exposure of the detector required to detect a WIMP signal with a significance of 5σ is approximately 2300 kg*year."
