    "message_2": "To determine the range of a 10 MeV alpha particle in water, we can use the Bethe-Bloch formula, which describes the energy loss of charged particles as they pass through a medium. However, this formula is quite complex and requires several parameters. A more practical approach is to use the Continuous Slowing Down Approximation Range (CSDA range) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database.\n\nAccording to the NIST database, the CSDA range of a 10 MeV alpha particle in water is approximately 32.8 µm (micrometers).\n\nThe Bragg peak is the point at which the energy deposition of the alpha particle is the highest, and it typically occurs near the end of the particle's range. In this case, the Bragg peak would occur at a depth close to the CSDA range, which is approximately 32.8 µm in water."
