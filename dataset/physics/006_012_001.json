    "message_2": "The ionization energy required to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (for hydrogen, Z = 1), and n is the principal quantum number (for the ground state, n = 1).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the atom, so we need to consider the absolute value of the energy:\n\nIonization energy = |-13.6 eV| = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy required to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
