    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the de Broglie wavelength formula and the energy-to-wavelength conversion formula.\n\n1. de Broglie wavelength formula: λ = h / p, where λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the neutron.\n\n2. Energy-to-wavelength conversion: E = (1/2)mv^2, where E is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the neutron, and v is the velocity of the neutron.\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity (v) of the neutron using the kinetic energy formula. The mass of a neutron is approximately 1.675 x 10^-27 kg, and the kinetic energy is given as 1 keV, which is equivalent to 1 x 10^3 eV. To convert eV to Joules, we multiply by the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C).\n\nE = 1 x 10^3 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.602 x 10^-16 J\n\nNow, we can solve for the velocity (v) using the kinetic energy formula:\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2\n1.602 x 10^-16 J = (1/2)(1.675 x 10^-27 kg)v^2\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv^2 = (2 * 1.602 x 10^-16 J) / (1.675 x 10^-27 kg)\nv^2 ≈ 1.911 x 10^11\nv ≈ 4.37 x 10^5 m/s\n\nNow that we have the velocity, we can find the momentum (p) of the neutron:\n\np = mv\np = (1.675 x 10^-27 kg)(4.37 x 10^5 m/s)\np ≈ 7.32 x 10^-22 kg m/s\n\nFinally, we can find the de Broglie wavelength (λ) of the neutron:\n\nλ = h / p\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (7.32 x 10^-22 kg m/s)\nλ ≈ 9.05 x 10^-13 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the neutron is approximately 9.05 x 10^-13 m or 0.905 nm."
