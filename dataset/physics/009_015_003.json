    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through different parts of a lens converge at different points along the optical axis. In order to calculate the amount of spherical aberration produced by the lens, we need to find the difference in focal lengths between the marginal and paraxial rays.\n\nFirst, let's find the focal length (f) of the lens using the lensmaker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. For a biconvex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative, so the formula becomes:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (1/R - 1/(-R))\n\nAssuming the lens is made of crown glass with a refractive index of 1.5, and the radius of curvature R is 20 cm:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/20 + 1/20)\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/10)\nf = 20 cm\n\nNow, let's find the focal lengths of the marginal and paraxial rays. The marginal rays pass through the edge of the lens (aperture radius = 3 cm), while the paraxial rays pass close to the optical axis.\n\nFor a thin lens, the focal length of the marginal rays (fm) can be approximated as:\n\nfm = R / (n - 1)\n\nfm = 20 / (1.5 - 1)\nfm = 20 / 0.5\nfm = 40 cm\n\nThe focal length of the paraxial rays (fp) is the same as the focal length we calculated earlier:\n\nfp = 20 cm\n\nThe amount of spherical aberration is the difference between the focal lengths of the marginal and paraxial rays:\n\nSpherical aberration = |fm - fp|\nSpherical aberration = |40 - 20|\nSpherical aberration = 20 cm\n\nSo, the amount of spherical aberration produced by this lens is 20 cm."
