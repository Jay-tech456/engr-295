    "message_1": "Consider two light waves, A and B, that are in phase with each other and have the same frequency. Wave A travels along the x-axis with a speed of 0.8c while Wave B travels in the opposite direction along the same axis with a speed of 0.4c. After 10 seconds, at what time will the waves be exactly out of phase with each other?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the relative speed between the two waves. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add their speeds:\n\nRelative speed = 0.8c + 0.4c = 1.2c\n\nNow, let's find the distance between the two waves after 10 seconds. We'll use the relative speed and the time to find this distance:\n\nDistance = Relative speed × Time\nDistance = 1.2c × 10s\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the waves to be exactly out of phase with each other. For this to happen, the distance between the two waves must be equal to half the wavelength (λ/2) since they have the same frequency.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes for the waves to be out of phase as t. Then, we can write the equation:\n\n1.2c × t = λ/2\n\nTo solve for t, we need to find the wavelength (λ) of the waves. Since both waves have the same frequency (f) and travel at the speed of light (c), we can use the equation:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nHowever, we don't have the frequency (f) given in the problem. Without the frequency, we cannot find the exact time (t) when the waves will be out of phase. If the frequency were provided, we could use the above equations to find the time when the waves are exactly out of phase."
