    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the binary neutron star system and the Earth, we need to know the observed frequency (f) and amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves produced by the system. However, you haven't provided these values. I will provide a general approach to solve the problem, and you can plug in the values to get the answer.\n\nThe gravitational wave strain amplitude (h) is related to the distance (D) to the source, the masses of the neutron stars (M1 and M2), and the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves. The chirp mass (M_c) is a combination of the masses of the neutron stars and is given by:\n\nM_c = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nThe gravitational wave strain amplitude (h) can be expressed as:\n\nh = (4 * G^(5/3) * π^(2/3) * M_c^(5/3) * f^(2/3)) / (c^4 * D)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and D is the distance between the binary neutron star system and the Earth.\n\nWe need to rearrange this equation to solve for D:\n\nD = (4 * G^(5/3) * π^(2/3) * M_c^(5/3) * f^(2/3)) / (c^4 * h)\n\nNow, you can plug in the observed frequency (f) and amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves, as well as the chirp mass (M_c) calculated from the masses of the neutron stars, into this equation to find the distance (D) between the binary neutron star system and the Earth.\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation assumes that the gravitational waves are produced by a quasi-circular inspiral of the binary neutron star system, and that the system is not too close to the Earth, so that the waves can be considered to be in the far-field regime."
