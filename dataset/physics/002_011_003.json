    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the adiabatic process equation and the work done formula for an adiabatic process.\n\nFor an adiabatic process, the equation is:\n\nPV^γ = constant\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and γ (gamma) is the ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv).\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (P1) as 3 atm, the final pressure (P2) as 9 atm, the initial volume (V1) as 20 liters, and the ratio of specific heats (γ) as 1.4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the final volume (V2). Using the adiabatic process equation:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nRearranging to solve for V2:\n\nV2^γ = (P1 * V1^γ) / P2\nV2 = ((P1 * V1^γ) / P2)^(1/γ)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nV2 = ((3 atm * (20 L)^1.4) / 9 atm)^(1/1.4)\nV2 ≈ 8.44 L\n\nNow, we can find the adiabatic work done (W) using the formula:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nW = (3 atm * 20 L - 9 atm * 8.44 L) / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ -120.6 J\n\nSince the work done is negative, it indicates that the work is done on the gas during the adiabatic compression process. Therefore, the adiabatic work done by the 2 moles of an ideal gas when compressed adiabatically is approximately -120.6 Joules."
