    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. They constantly bombard Earth and other celestial bodies, including spacecraft and astronauts during space travel. These particles can cause various harmful effects on both spacecraft and the health of astronauts.\n\nEffects on spacecraft:\n1. Single event effects (SEE): Cosmic rays can cause temporary or permanent malfunctions in electronic components of a spacecraft. These malfunctions can lead to data corruption, system resets, or even complete failure of the component.\n2. Material degradation: Prolonged exposure to cosmic rays can cause structural damage to spacecraft materials, leading to reduced mechanical strength and increased brittleness.\n\nEffects on astronaut health:\n1. Acute radiation sickness: High doses of cosmic rays can cause acute radiation sickness, which includes symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and skin burns.\n2. Long-term health effects: Prolonged exposure to cosmic rays increases the risk of developing cancer, cataracts, and damage to the central nervous system. It can also cause degenerative tissue damage, leading to muscle atrophy and reduced bone density.\n\nMeasures to reduce harmful effects of cosmic rays:\n\n1. Shielding: Using materials with high hydrogen content, such as water or polyethylene, can provide effective shielding against cosmic rays. These materials can be incorporated into spacecraft walls or used to create a \"storm shelter\" for astronauts during periods of high radiation exposure.\n2. Active shielding: Magnetic or electrostatic fields can be used to deflect charged particles, providing an additional layer of protection against cosmic rays.\n3. Spacecraft design: Designing spacecraft with redundant systems and radiation-hardened components can help minimize the risk of malfunctions due to cosmic rays.\n4. Mission planning: Scheduling space missions during periods of low solar activity and minimizing the time spent in regions with high radiation exposure, such as the Earth's radiation belts, can help reduce the risk to astronauts.\n5. Radiation monitoring: Continuous monitoring of radiation levels during space missions can help identify periods of high radiation exposure and enable astronauts to take appropriate protective measures.\n6. Pharmacological countermeasures: Developing drugs that can mitigate the harmful effects of radiation exposure, such as antioxidants or radioprotective agents, can help protect astronauts during long-term interplanetary missions."
