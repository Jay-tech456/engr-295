    "message_1": "Calculate the specific heat capacity of a metal block with a mass of 200 grams and an initial temperature of 25°C. The block is heated with a Bunsen burner until its temperature reaches 100°C. During this process, 500 J of heat energy were supplied to the block. What is the specific heat capacity of the metal block?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the specific heat capacity (c) of the metal block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy supplied (500 J), m is the mass of the block (200 g), c is the specific heat capacity we want to find, and ΔT is the change in temperature (100°C - 25°C).\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 500 J / (200 g × 75°C)\n\nc = 500 J / 15000 g°C\n\nc = 0.0333 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the metal block is approximately 0.0333 J/g°C."
