    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of the mixture, we can use a weighted average based on the percentage composition of each gas in the mixture. \n\nSpecific heat capacity of the mixture (Cp_mix) = (percentage of nitrogen × specific heat capacity of nitrogen) + (percentage of oxygen × specific heat capacity of oxygen) + (percentage of carbon dioxide × specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide)\n\nCp_mix = (0.60 × 0.743 kJ/kg·K) + (0.20 × 0.919 kJ/kg·K) + (0.20 × 0.844 kJ/kg·K)\n\nCp_mix = (0.4458 kJ/kg·K) + (0.1838 kJ/kg·K) + (0.1688 kJ/kg·K)\n\nCp_mix = 0.7984 kJ/kg·K\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the mixture is approximately 0.7984 kJ/kg·K."
