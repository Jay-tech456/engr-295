    "message_1": "A spacecraft is moving away from Earth with a velocity of 0.8c (where c is the speed of light). A radio transmitter on the spacecraft is emitting a signal with a frequency of 10 GHz. What frequency will be measured on Earth by a receiver? Use the relativistic Doppler effect formula to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "The relativistic Doppler effect formula is given by:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency measured on Earth, f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spacecraft, and β is the ratio of the spacecraft's velocity to the speed of light (v/c).\n\nIn this case, f_emitted = 10 GHz and β = 0.8.\n\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\nf_observed = 10 GHz * sqrt(1 / 9)\nf_observed = 10 GHz * (1 / 3)\n\nf_observed ≈ 3.33 GHz\n\nSo, the frequency measured on Earth by a receiver will be approximately 3.33 GHz."
