    "message_1": "Consider a quantum computer that uses spin qubits to store and manipulate information. Suppose the computer has a total of 4 qubits, each of which can be in the spin-up or spin-down state. If one of the qubits is randomly measured and found to be in the spin-up state, what is the probability that the other three qubits are also in the spin-up state?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. We have a total of 4 qubits, and each qubit can be in either the spin-up or spin-down state. This means that there are 2^4 = 16 possible states for the entire system.\n\nNow, we are given that one of the qubits is measured and found to be in the spin-up state. This means that we can eliminate half of the possible states, as we now know that one of the qubits is definitely in the spin-up state. So, we are left with 2^3 = 8 possible states.\n\nOut of these 8 possible states, we want to find the probability that the other three qubits are also in the spin-up state. There is only 1 state where all four qubits are in the spin-up state (↑↑↑↑).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the other three qubits are also in the spin-up state is 1/8 or 0.125 (12.5%)."
