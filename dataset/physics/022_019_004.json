    "message_2": "To estimate the mass of a gravitino particle under the assumption that it comprises all of the dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the total mass of dark matter and the number of gravitino particles.\n\nThe total mass of dark matter in the universe is estimated to be around 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. The total mass-energy content of the universe is approximately 3.4 x 10^54 kg. Therefore, the total mass of dark matter is roughly 0.27 * 3.4 x 10^54 kg = 9.18 x 10^53 kg.\n\nNow, let's assume that there are N gravitino particles in the universe. The mass of a single gravitino particle (m_gravitino) can be estimated by dividing the total mass of dark matter by the number of gravitino particles:\n\nm_gravitino = (9.18 x 10^53 kg) / N\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine the exact number of gravitino particles (N) in the universe. The mass of a gravitino particle is model-dependent and can vary significantly depending on the specific supersymmetric model considered. In some models, the gravitino mass can be as low as a few eV (electron volts), while in others, it can be as high as several TeV (tera electron volts).\n\nWithout more information on the specific model and the number of gravitino particles, it is impossible to provide an exact mass for a gravitino particle under the given assumption."
