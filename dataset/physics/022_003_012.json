    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in galaxies has a significant impact on the rotation curves of stars within those galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in a galaxy versus their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to classical physics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the rotation curve to show a decrease in orbital speed as the distance from the center increases, similar to the behavior of planets in our solar system.\n\nHowever, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies, starting with the work of Vera Rubin and collaborators in the 1970s, have shown that the orbital speeds of stars do not decrease with distance from the center as expected. Instead, they remain relatively constant or even increase slightly at larger distances. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter alone led to the hypothesis of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is an invisible, non-luminous form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. Its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the observed rotation curves of galaxies. The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy forms a halo around the galaxy, which extends far beyond the visible stars and gas.\n\nThe presence of this dark matter halo affects the rotation curves of stars within the galaxy by providing additional gravitational force, which keeps the stars moving at higher speeds than would be expected based on visible matter alone. This results in the observed flat or slightly increasing rotation curves at large distances from the center of the galaxy.\n\nFrom these rotation curves, we can infer several properties of dark matter:\n\n1. Dark matter is non-luminous: It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes that detect electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2. Dark matter is massive: It contributes significantly to the total mass of a galaxy, providing the additional gravitational force needed to explain the observed rotation curves.\n\n3. Dark matter is distributed in a halo-like structure: The distribution of dark matter extends far beyond the visible stars and gas in a galaxy, forming a halo that influences the motion of stars at large distances from the center.\n\n4. Dark matter interacts primarily through gravity: While the exact nature of dark matter is still unknown, its primary interaction with visible matter appears to be through gravitational forces, as evidenced by its effects on the rotation curves of galaxies.\n\nFurther research and observations, such as those from gravitational lensing and cosmic microwave background radiation, continue to provide more information about the properties and distribution of dark matter in the universe."
