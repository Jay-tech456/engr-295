    "message_1": "A current-carrying wire behaves like a magnet. Consider a helical wire carrying a current of 2 A and with a radius of 3 cm. Calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, 4 cm from the center of the helix.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the helix, and z is the distance from the center of the helix to the point on the axis.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nI = 2 A\nR = 3 cm = 0.03 m\nz = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.03 m)²) / (2 * ((0.03 m)² + (0.04 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.0009 m²) / (2 * (0.0009 m² + 0.0016 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (7.2π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (7.2π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * 0.00395 m^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.14 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, 4 cm from the center of the helix, is approximately 1.14 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
