    "message_2": "The coherence time (T2) of a quantum system is the time it takes for the system to lose its quantum coherence due to decoherence. It can be calculated using the decoherence rate (Γ) as follows:\n\nT2 = 1 / Γ\n\nGiven a decoherence rate (Γ) of 1 kHz, we can calculate the coherence time (T2):\n\nT2 = 1 / (1 kHz)\nT2 = 1 / (1 × 10^3 Hz)\nT2 = 1 × 10^(-3) s\n\nSo, the coherence time for the two-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer is 1 ms (millisecond)."
