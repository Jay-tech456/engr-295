    "message_2": "The concept of a dark atom, composed of a dark nucleon and a dark electron, is a speculative idea in the realm of dark matter research. There is no definitive answer to the mass and size range of such dark atoms, as they are not yet supported by experimental evidence. However, we can discuss some theoretical possibilities based on current models and observations of dark matter.\n\nOne possibility is that dark atoms could be composed of particles called WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are thought to make up a significant portion of dark matter. They are expected to have masses in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton (1 GeV/c² to 1 TeV/c²).\n\nIf dark atoms were composed of WIMPs, the mass of a dark nucleon would likely be in the same range as the WIMP mass, while the mass of a dark electron would be significantly smaller, possibly similar to the mass of a neutrino (less than 1 eV/c²). The size of a dark atom would depend on the interaction strength between the dark nucleon and dark electron, which is currently unknown.\n\nAnother possibility is that dark atoms could be composed of particles called axions. Axions are hypothetical particles that are much lighter than WIMPs, with masses in the range of 10^(-6) eV/c² to 1 eV/c². If dark atoms were composed of axions, the mass of a dark nucleon and dark electron would be in the same range as the axion mass. The size of a dark atom in this case would also depend on the interaction strength between the dark nucleon and dark electron.\n\nIt is important to note that these are just theoretical possibilities, and the true nature of dark matter remains unknown. Further experimental and observational evidence is needed to determine whether dark atoms exist and to constrain their properties."
