    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth with a velocity of 0.8c, emitting waves of frequency 100 MHz. If the speed of sound is negligible in space, what frequency will be received on Earth? (Assume the distance between the spaceship and Earth is very large compared to the size of the spaceship itself). Using Relativistic Doppler effect, calculate the frequency shift observed on Earth compared to the frequency emitted by the spaceship.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency received on Earth, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed on Earth, f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship (100 MHz), β is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c), and sqrt denotes the square root.\n\nIn this case, β = v/c = 0.8.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nf_observed = 100 MHz * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\nf_observed = 100 MHz * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\nf_observed = 100 MHz * sqrt(9)\nf_observed = 100 MHz * 3\n\nf_observed = 300 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency received on Earth is 300 MHz.\n\nTo calculate the frequency shift, we can simply subtract the emitted frequency from the observed frequency:\n\nFrequency shift = f_observed - f_emitted\nFrequency shift = 300 MHz - 100 MHz\nFrequency shift = 200 MHz\n\nThe frequency shift observed on Earth compared to the frequency emitted by the spaceship is 200 MHz."
