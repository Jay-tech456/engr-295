    "message_2": "To derive an expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of the disc, we will use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, we can define a surface current density K = I / (πR²), where I is the total current and R is the radius of the disc.\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element on the disc at a distance ρ from the center. The area of this small current element is dA = 2πρdρ. The current through this small element is dI = K * dA = (2πρdρ * I) / (πR²).\n\nThe magnetic field dB due to this small current element at a distance z above the center of the disc can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law. The position vector r from the current element to the point is given by:\n\nr = √(ρ² + z²)\n\nThe angle θ between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product dl × r simplifies to dl * r. The magnetic field dB is then given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r) / r³\n\nSince the disc is circular and the current is uniformly distributed, the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of the disc will have only a vertical component. Therefore, we can write:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * z) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire disc, we get:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫(dI * dl * z) / r³ dA\n\nSubstituting dI and dA, we get:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫((2πρdρ * I) / (πR²) * dl * z) / (ρ² + z²)^(3/2) dρ\n\nThe limits of integration for ρ are from 0 to R. Now, let's integrate with respect to ρ:\n\nBz = (μ₀Iz / 2R²) * ∫(ρdρ) / (ρ² + z²)^(3/2) from 0 to R\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nu = ρ² + z²\ndu = 2ρdρ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nBz = (μ₀Iz / 4R²) * ∫(du) / u^(3/2) from z² to R² + z²\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to u:\n\nBz = (μ₀Iz / 4R²) * [-2 / √u] from z² to R² + z²\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nBz = (μ₀I / 4R²) * (2√(R² + z²) - 2z)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of the disc:\n\nBz = (μ₀I / 2R²) * (1 - z / √(R² + z²))\n\nThis is the expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance z above the center of a circular disc carrying a constant current I uniformly distributed over its surface."
