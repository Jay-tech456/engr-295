    "message_2": "W' and Z' bosons are hypothetical particles predicted by various extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. These particles are expected to be heavier versions of the W and Z bosons, which are responsible for the weak nuclear force. The masses and decay modes of W' and Z' bosons depend on the specific theoretical model in which they are predicted.\n\n1. Sequential Standard Model (SSM): In this model, W' and Z' bosons are expected to have similar properties to their lighter counterparts, but with higher masses. The W' boson would decay into a quark and an antiquark or a charged lepton and a neutrino, while the Z' boson would decay into a pair of quarks, charged leptons, or neutrinos. The masses of these particles in the SSM are not well-constrained, but they are expected to be in the range of a few TeV.\n\n2. Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM): This model predicts the existence of W' and Z' bosons as a consequence of an extended gauge symmetry. In this model, the W' boson can decay into a quark and an antiquark or a charged lepton and a neutrino, while the Z' boson can decay into a pair of quarks, charged leptons, or neutrinos. The masses of W' and Z' bosons in the LRSM are typically in the range of a few TeV.\n\n3. Little Higgs Models: These models predict the existence of W' and Z' bosons as a result of new symmetry-breaking mechanisms. The decay modes of these particles can be quite different from those in the SSM or LRSM, depending on the specific model. The masses of W' and Z' bosons in Little Higgs models can range from a few hundred GeV to several TeV.\n\nExperimental searches for W' and Z' bosons at the LHC have so far not found any evidence for their existence. The LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, have set limits on the masses and couplings of these particles based on their non-observation. For example, in the SSM, the lower mass limits for W' and Z' bosons are around 4-5 TeV, while in the LRSM, the lower mass limits are around 3-4 TeV. These limits depend on the specific decay modes and assumptions made in the theoretical models.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected masses and decay modes of W' and Z' bosons depend on the specific theoretical model in which they are predicted. Experimental searches at the LHC have not yet found any evidence for these particles, but they have set limits on their masses and couplings, which help to constrain the parameter space of various theoretical models. Future searches at the LHC and other colliders will continue to probe the existence of W' and Z' bosons and test the predictions of different particle physics models."
