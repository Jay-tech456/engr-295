    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the plasma thruster, we first need to determine the kinetic power of the exhaust. The kinetic power (P_kinetic) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP_kinetic = 0.5 * m_dot * v_exhaust^2\n\nwhere m_dot is the mass flow rate and v_exhaust is the exhaust velocity.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\n- Mass flow rate (m_dot): 5 mg/s = 5 * 10^-6 kg/s\n- Exhaust velocity (v_exhaust): 50 km/s = 50 * 10^3 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic power:\n\nP_kinetic = 0.5 * (5 * 10^-6 kg/s) * (50 * 10^3 m/s)^2\nP_kinetic = 0.5 * (5 * 10^-6) * (2.5 * 10^6)\nP_kinetic = 6.25 W\n\nNow that we have the kinetic power, we can calculate the efficiency (η) of the plasma thruster using the formula:\n\nη = (P_kinetic / P_discharge) * 100\n\nwhere P_discharge is the discharge power.\n\nη = (6.25 W / 500 W) * 100\nη ≈ 1.25%\n\nThe efficiency of the plasma thruster is approximately 1.25%."
