    "message_2": "The electric potential of a Reissner-Nordström black hole with charge Q and mass M at a given distance r from its center can be calculated using the formula for the electric potential of a point charge:\n\nV(r) = kQ/r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (also known as Coulomb's constant), which is approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2.\n\nThe Reissner-Nordström metric describes the geometry of space-time around a charged, non-rotating black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds^2 = -(1 - 2GM/c^2r + GQ^2/c^4r^2) c^2dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/c^2r + GQ^2/c^4r^2)^(-1) dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2θ dφ^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nThe electric potential affects the properties of the black hole in several ways:\n\n1. Event horizon: The presence of the electric charge modifies the location of the event horizon. For a Reissner-Nordström black hole, there can be two event horizons, an outer event horizon (r+) and an inner event horizon (r-), given by:\n\nr± = GM/c^2 ± sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - GQ^2/c^4)\n\nIf the charge is large enough (Q^2 > GM^2c^2/G), the black hole becomes a naked singularity, meaning it has no event horizon.\n\n2. Curvature of space-time: The electric charge contributes to the curvature of space-time around the black hole. The curvature scalar R, which is a measure of the curvature of space-time, is given by:\n\nR = 2GQ^2/c^4r^4\n\nThis shows that the electric charge increases the curvature of space-time near the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the electric potential of a Reissner-Nordström black hole affects the properties of the black hole, such as its event horizon and the curvature of space-time. The presence of the electric charge modifies the location of the event horizon and contributes to the curvature of space-time around the black hole."
