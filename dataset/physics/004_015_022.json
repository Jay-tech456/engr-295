    "message_2": "There are several lines of evidence that suggest the existence of dark matter in the universe. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or absorb light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. It is believed to account for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. The evidence for dark matter comes from various observations, including:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxy together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light due to gravity, as predicted by General Relativity, has been observed around massive objects like galaxy clusters. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass of these objects, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass in the form of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in specific proportions.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, where the visible matter (mostly gas) has been separated from the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing). This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the separated mass cannot be accounted for by the visible matter alone.\n\nThe existence of dark matter has significant implications for General Relativity's understanding of gravitational interactions among celestial bodies. While General Relativity remains a valid and accurate description of gravity on large scales, the presence of dark matter introduces an additional source of gravitational force that is not accounted for by the visible mass of celestial bodies. This means that the total gravitational force acting on objects in the universe is a combination of the forces due to both visible and dark matter. Consequently, dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe."
