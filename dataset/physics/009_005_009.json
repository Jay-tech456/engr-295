    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image and its magnification, we can use the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nThe focal length (f) of a concave mirror is half of its radius of curvature (R):\nf = R/2\nf = 15 cm / 2\nf = 7.5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the mirror equation:\n1/7.5 = 1/10 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator (30):\n4/30 - 3/30 = 1/di\n1/30 = 1/di\n\nSo, di = 30 cm. The image is formed 30 cm in front of the mirror.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\nM = -di/do\n\nWe know that the image is 3 times larger than the object, so M = 3. Plugging in the values we found:\n3 = -30/do\n\nSolving for do, we get:\ndo = -30/3\ndo = -10 cm\n\nSince the object distance is negative, this means that the object is actually placed on the other side of the mirror (i.e., it's a virtual object). However, the problem states that the object is placed 10 cm in front of the mirror, which contradicts this result. Therefore, it's not possible for a concave mirror with the given radius of curvature to produce an image that is 3 times larger than the object when the object is placed 10 cm in front of the mirror."
