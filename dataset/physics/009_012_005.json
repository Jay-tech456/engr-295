    "message_1": "A converging lens has a focal length of 15 cm. An object is placed 30 cm away from the lens. What is the image distance from the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nWe can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n2/30 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/v = 2/30 - 1/30\n1/v = 1/30\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find v:\n\nv = 30 cm\n\nSo, the image distance from the lens is 30 cm."
