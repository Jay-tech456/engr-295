    "message_1": "A spacecraft is traveling towards a star emitting light with a frequency of 540 THz. If the spacecraft is moving at 70% of the speed of light, what is the frequency of the light detected by an observer on the spacecraft? (Assume the speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s and neglect any effects due to gravity or other factors.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Doppler effect formula for the frequency of light detected by an observer moving towards a light source. The formula is:\n\nf' = f * (c + v) / c\n\nwhere:\nf' is the frequency detected by the observer,\nf is the frequency of the light emitted by the star (540 THz),\nc is the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s),\nand v is the speed of the spacecraft (0.7 * c).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the speed of the spacecraft:\n\nv = 0.7 * c = 0.7 * 299,792,458 m/s ≈ 209,854,720 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf' = 540 THz * (299,792,458 m/s + 209,854,720 m/s) / 299,792,458 m/s\n\nf' = 540 THz * (509,647,178 m/s) / 299,792,458 m/s\n\nf' ≈ 918 THz\n\nSo, the frequency of the light detected by an observer on the spacecraft is approximately 918 THz."
