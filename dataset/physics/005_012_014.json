    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we can use the following equation:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the object is traveling at 0.9 times the speed of light, we have:\n\nv = 0.9 * c\n\nNow, let's find γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9 * c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (2.294 - 1) * 500 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. ≈ 1.294 * 500 kg * (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. ≈ 6.47 * 10^17 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is approximately 6.47 * 10^17 Joules."
