    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image from the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 3*di + 2*di\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n60 = 5*di\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ndi = 60/5\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the distance of the image from the lens is 12 cm."
