    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It is invisible to electromagnetic radiation, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation. One possible explanation for dark matter is that it could be composed of dark radiation, which refers to hypothetical particles that do not interact with electromagnetic radiation but still contribute to the overall energy density of the universe.\n\nExperimental evidence supporting the notion that dark matter could be composed of dark radiation comes from several sources:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to infer the presence of dark matter. Some studies have suggested that the presence of dark radiation could help explain the observed distribution of CMB temperature fluctuations.\n\n2. Large Scale Structure Formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be used to infer the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation that include dark radiation have been shown to produce results that are consistent with observations, suggesting that dark radiation could be a component of dark matter.\n\n3. Neutrino Oscillations: Neutrinos are elementary particles that only interact weakly with other matter. They are known to oscillate between different flavors, which is a phenomenon that can only be explained if neutrinos have mass. Some models of dark radiation propose that it could be composed of sterile neutrinos, which are hypothetical neutrinos that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity. The existence of sterile neutrinos could help explain the observed neutrino oscillations.\n\nDifferent models of dark matter composed of dark radiation include:\n\n1. Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter: In this model, dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos, which are heavier than the known neutrinos and do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity. The observational implications of this model include the possible detection of sterile neutrinos through their decay products, such as X-ray emissions from galaxy clusters.\n\n2. Dark Photons: Dark photons are hypothetical particles that are similar to photons but do not interact with electromagnetic radiation. They could be a component of dark radiation and contribute to the overall energy density of the universe. The observational implications of this model include the possible detection of dark photons through their interactions with visible matter, such as the production of electron-positron pairs.\n\n3. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are light, neutral particles that could be a component of dark radiation. The observational implications of this model include the possible detection of axions through their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field, such as those found in galaxy clusters or near neutron stars.\n\nIn conclusion, there is experimental evidence from the CMB, large scale structure formation, and neutrino oscillations that supports the notion that dark matter could be composed of dark radiation. Different models of dark matter composed of dark radiation include sterile neutrino dark matter, dark photons, and axions, each with its own observational implications. Further research and observations are needed to determine the true nature of dark matter and whether it is indeed composed of dark radiation."
