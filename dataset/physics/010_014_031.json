    "message_2": "When a rocket is flying at Mach 3 in the Earth's atmosphere and encounters a region of supersonic flow, we can analyze the changes in pressure and velocity of the gases flowing through the nozzle using the principles of compressible flow, specifically the area-Mach number relation.\n\nThe area-Mach number relation states that for a supersonic flow (Mach number > 1), when the cross-sectional area of a duct (in this case, the rocket's nozzle) decreases, the Mach number and velocity of the flow will increase, and the pressure will decrease.\n\nSo, when the cross-sectional area of the rocket's nozzle is decreased by 50%, the velocity of the gases flowing through the nozzle will increase, and the pressure will decrease. The exact change in pressure and velocity depends on the specific flow properties and the shape of the nozzle."
