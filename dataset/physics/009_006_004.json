    "message_1": "What is the focal length of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 20cm, if an object is placed 30cm away from the mirror and its image is formed at 60cm from the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance (distance of the object from the mirror), and v is the image distance (distance of the image from the mirror).\n\nFirst, we need to find the focal length (f) using the radius of curvature (R). For a concave mirror, the focal length is half of the radius of curvature:\n\nf = R/2\nf = 20cm / 2\nf = 10cm\n\nNow we have the focal length (f = 10cm), the object distance (u = -30cm, negative because the object is on the same side as the mirror), and the image distance (v = 60cm, positive because the image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror).\n\nWe can now use the mirror formula to check if the given distances are correct:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/(-30) + 1/60\n\n1/10 = -1/30 + 1/60\n1/10 = (-1 + 2)/60\n1/10 = 1/60\n\nThis equation is not true, so the given object and image distances are not correct for a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 20cm and a focal length of 10cm."
