    "message_2": "To find the radius of curvature of the lens surfaces, we can use the Lensmaker's Equation:\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nFor a converging lens, both surfaces are convex, so R1 and R2 will have the same sign. We can simplify the equation by assuming that both surfaces have the same radius of curvature (R):\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * (1/R - 1/R)\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * (1/R)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for f and n:\n\n(1/30 cm) = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R)\n\n1/30 = 0.5 * (1/R)\n\nTo find R, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nR = 1 / (2 * (1/30))\n\nR = 1 / (1/15)\n\nR = 15 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of both lens surfaces is 15 cm."
