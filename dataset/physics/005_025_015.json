    "message_2": "To find the kinetic energy of the particle using relativistic quantum mechanics, we first need to find the relativistic energy of the particle. The relativistic energy E is given by the equation:\n\nE = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven the rest mass m = 2 GeV/c² and the velocity v = 0.9c, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (2 GeV/c²) * c² / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)²/c²)\n\nE = 2 GeV / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\n\nE = 2 GeV / sqrt(0.19)\n\nE = 2 GeV / 0.43589\n\nE ≈ 4.59 GeV\n\nNow we have the relativistic energy of the particle. To find the kinetic energy, we need to subtract the rest energy (mc²) from the relativistic energy:\n\nKinetic energy = E - mc²\n\nSince mc² = 2 GeV,\n\nKinetic energy ≈ 4.59 GeV - 2 GeV\n\nKinetic energy ≈ 2.59 GeV\n\nNow we need to convert the kinetic energy from GeV to Joules. The conversion factor is:\n\n1 GeV = 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁰ J\n\nSo, the kinetic energy in Joules is:\n\nKinetic energy ≈ 2.59 GeV * (1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/GeV)\n\nKinetic energy ≈ 4.14864 × 10⁻¹⁰ J"
