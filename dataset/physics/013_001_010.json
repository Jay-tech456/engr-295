    "message_2": "The relationship between the accretion rate and the radiation emitted from a black hole accretion disk can be described using the concept of radiative efficiency. Radiative efficiency is the fraction of the rest mass energy of the accreting material that is converted into radiation as it falls onto the black hole. This efficiency depends on the properties of the black hole, such as its mass and spin.\n\nIn general, the radiation emitted from an accretion disk is proportional to the accretion rate (the rate at which mass is falling onto the black hole). The more mass that falls onto the black hole, the more energy is released in the form of radiation. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nL = η * M_dot * c^2\n\nwhere L is the luminosity (radiation emitted), η is the radiative efficiency, M_dot is the accretion rate, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe radiative efficiency, η, depends on the properties of the black hole, such as its mass (M) and spin (a). For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the radiative efficiency is approximately 5.7%. For a maximally rotating (Kerr) black hole, the radiative efficiency can be as high as 42%.\n\nThe spin of a black hole affects the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around it. For a non-rotating black hole, the ISCO is at 3 times the Schwarzschild radius, while for a maximally rotating black hole, the ISCO can be as close as the event horizon. The closer the ISCO is to the black hole, the more energy can be extracted from the accreting material, leading to a higher radiative efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the accretion rate and the radiation emitted from a black hole accretion disk is proportional, with the proportionality constant being the radiative efficiency. The radiative efficiency depends on the properties of the black hole, such as its mass and spin, with higher spin leading to higher radiative efficiency."
