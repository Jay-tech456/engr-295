    "message_2": "As a text-based AI, I cannot draw a ray diagram. However, I can guide you through the process of drawing one and help you determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the lens.\n\nTo draw a ray diagram for a converging lens, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis of the lens.\n2. Draw a vertical line in the middle of the principal axis to represent the lens.\n3. Mark the focal points (F1 and F2) on both sides of the lens, 10 cm away from the lens (since the focal length is 10 cm).\n4. Place the object (a vertical arrow) on the left side of the lens, 20 cm away from the lens (as given in the problem).\n5. Draw three rays from the top of the object arrow:\n\n   a. Ray 1: Draw a straight line from the top of the object to the lens, parallel to the principal axis. After passing through the lens, this ray will pass through the focal point F2 on the right side of the lens.\n   \n   b. Ray 2: Draw a straight line from the top of the object through the center of the lens. This ray will pass through the lens without changing direction.\n   \n   c. Ray 3: Draw a straight line from the top of the object through the focal point F1 on the left side of the lens. After passing through the lens, this ray will become parallel to the principal axis.\n\n6. The point where all three rays converge on the right side of the lens is the location of the image's top. Draw a vertical arrow from this point to the principal axis to represent the image.\n\nNow, let's determine the position, size, and nature of the image:\n\nPosition: Since the object is placed at a distance of 20 cm from the lens (which is twice the focal length), the image will be formed at the same distance on the other side of the lens. So, the image is 20 cm away from the lens on the right side.\n\nSize: To find the size of the image, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nLens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n1/10 + 1/20 = 1/v\nv = 20 cm\n\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\nM = -20 / (-20)\nM = 1\n\nSince the magnification is 1, the size of the image is the same as the size of the object.\n\nNature: The image is formed on the right side of the lens where all the rays converge, which means it is a real image. Also, since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the converging lens is real, upright, and the same size as the object. It is located 20 cm away from the lens on the right side."
