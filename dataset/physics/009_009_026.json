    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the converging lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, the focal length f = 20 cm and the object distance u = -30 cm (object distance is taken as negative as per the sign convention). We can now solve for the image distance v.\n\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60v, we get:\n3v = -2v + 60\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n5v = 60\n\nNow, divide by 5:\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe image distance is positive, which means the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens (real image).\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12 / (-30) = 0.4\n\nThe magnification is less than 1, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nSo, the image formed by the converging lens is 12 cm away from the lens on the opposite side, it is real, inverted, and smaller in size compared to the object."
