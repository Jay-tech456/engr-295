    "message_2": "The maximum energy of a cosmic ray that can cause a single event upset (SEU) in a typical electronic device depends on the specific device and its sensitivity to radiation. However, we can provide a general estimate based on the Linear Energy Transfer (LET) threshold of the device.\n\nThe LET threshold is a measure of the amount of energy deposited by a charged particle per unit length as it passes through a material. For a typical electronic device, the LET threshold is around 10 MeV-cm^2/mg. Cosmic rays with energies above this threshold can cause SEUs in electronic devices.\n\nThe probability of an SEU occurring in an electronic device due to a cosmic ray is a function of the energy of the cosmic ray, the device's sensitivity to radiation, and the shielding provided by the device's enclosure. As the energy of the cosmic ray increases, the probability of an SEU occurring also increases. This is because higher-energy cosmic rays are more likely to penetrate the shielding and deposit sufficient energy in the device to cause an SEU.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the probability of encountering a high-energy cosmic ray decreases as the energy increases. This means that while the probability of an SEU occurring due to a high-energy cosmic ray is higher, the overall likelihood of encountering such a cosmic ray is lower. As a result, the overall probability of an SEU occurring in an electronic device due to cosmic rays is a complex function of the energy of the cosmic rays and the device's sensitivity and shielding."
