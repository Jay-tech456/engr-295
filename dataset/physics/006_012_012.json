    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is the energy required to remove an electron from the lowest energy level (n=1) to a point where it is no longer bound to the atom (n → ∞). This energy is equal to the negative of the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom.\n\nUsing the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, we can calculate the ionization energy:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy, Z is the atomic number (Z=1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n=1 for the ground state).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE = -13.6 eV\n\nSince ionization energy is the negative of the ground state energy, the ionization energy for a hydrogen atom in its ground state is:\n\nIonization energy = 13.6 eV"
