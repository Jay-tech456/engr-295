Calculate the pressure of water at the base of the tank. (Density of water = 1000 kg/m³, acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s²)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure of water at the base of the tank, we can use the following formula:\n\nPressure (P) = Density (ρ) × Acceleration due to gravity (g) × Height (h)\n\nGiven the density of water (ρ) = 1000 kg/m³, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s², and the height of the water in the tank (h) = 4 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 1000 kg/m³ × 9.8 m/s² × 4 m\n\nP = 1000 × 9.8 × 4\n\nP = 39200 kg m/s² m²\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m/s² m², the pressure at the base of the tank is:\n\nP = 39200 Pa"
