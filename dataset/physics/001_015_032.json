    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the probability of successfully teleporting an unknown qubit state using the entangled Bell state |Φ+⟩ is 100% or 1.\n\nThe protocol works as follows:\n\n1. Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits in the Bell state |Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩).\n2. Alice has an unknown qubit state |ψ⟩ that she wants to send to Bob.\n3. Alice performs a joint measurement on her qubit of the unknown state and her half of the entangled pair, projecting them onto one of the four Bell states.\n4. Alice sends the result of her measurement (2 classical bits) to Bob through a classical communication channel.\n5. Based on Alice's measurement result, Bob applies a specific unitary transformation to his half of the entangled pair, which transforms it into the unknown state |ψ⟩.\n\nThe key to the success of this protocol is the entanglement between Alice's and Bob's qubits and the joint measurement performed by Alice. The protocol is deterministic, meaning that it will always work as long as the entangled pair is in the correct Bell state and the steps are followed correctly. Therefore, the probability of successfully teleporting the unknown qubit state is 100% or 1."
