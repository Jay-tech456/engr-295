    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. Although it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible to telescopes, it does interact gravitationally with visible matter. This gravitational interaction is essential for the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.\n\nIn the early universe, dark matter helped initiate the formation of large-scale structures by providing gravitational \"seeds\" that attracted ordinary matter. These seeds were small fluctuations in the density of dark matter, which caused it to clump together. As the dark matter clumped, it created gravitational wells that attracted ordinary matter, such as gas and dust. This process led to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter also affects the observed structure and dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Observations of galaxy rotation curves, which show the relationship between the orbital speed of stars and their distance from the galaxy's center, indicate that dark matter is distributed in a roughly spherical halo around galaxies. This halo extends far beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and contains a significant amount of mass, which influences the motion of stars and gas within the galaxy.\n\nIn galaxy clusters, the distribution of dark matter can be inferred from gravitational lensing, a phenomenon in which the path of light from distant objects is bent by the gravity of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters. Gravitational lensing observations have shown that dark matter is distributed throughout galaxy clusters, providing additional mass and gravitational attraction that holds the cluster together.\n\nIn summary, dark matter plays a vital role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe by providing the initial gravitational seeds that attract ordinary matter. Its distribution also influences the structure and dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters, shaping their formation and evolution over cosmic time."
