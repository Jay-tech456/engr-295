    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) of a graphene sheet at room temperature, we need two key parameters: carrier concentration (n) and carrier mobility (μ). The relationship between these parameters and electrical conductivity is given by the following formula:\n\nσ = n * e * μ\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 C).\n\nGiven the values of carrier concentration (n) and carrier mobility (μ), we can plug them into the formula and calculate the electrical conductivity of the graphene sheet.\n\nFor example, let's assume a carrier concentration of 10^12 cm^-2 and a carrier mobility of 2000 cm^2/Vs. We can convert the carrier concentration to m^-2 by multiplying by (10^4)^2:\n\nn = 10^12 cm^-2 * (10^4)^2 = 10^20 m^-2\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nσ = (10^20 m^-2) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (2000 cm^2/Vs)\n\nTo convert the mobility to m^2/Vs, we multiply by (10^-2)^2:\n\nσ = (10^20 m^-2) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (2000 * (10^-2)^2 m^2/Vs)\n\nσ = (10^20 m^-2) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (2 m^2/Vs)\n\nσ ≈ 3.2 x 10^2 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the graphene sheet at room temperature with the given carrier concentration and mobility is approximately 320 S/m."
