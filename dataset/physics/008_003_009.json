    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino oscillating from an electron neutrino to a muon neutrino, we need to know the energy of the neutrino (E), the mixing angle (θ), and the mass-squared difference between the two neutrino mass eigenstates (Δm^2). The formula for the probability of oscillation is given by:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin^2(2θ) * sin^2((1.27 * Δm^2 * L) / E)\n\nwhere L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in this case, 500 km), and E is the energy of the neutrino. The mass-squared difference Δm^2 is given in units of eV^2, and the energy E is given in units of GeV.\n\nWithout the specific values for the energy and mixing angle, we cannot provide an exact probability. However, once you have these values, you can plug them into the formula above to calculate the probability of oscillation."
