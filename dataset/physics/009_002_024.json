    "message_2": "According to Snell's Law, the relationship between the incident angle, refracted angle, and the indices of refraction of the two media is given by:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the index of refraction and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the index of refraction and angle of refraction in the second medium (the material).\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (since the index of refraction of air is approximately 1), θ1 = 40 degrees, and n2 = 1.6. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(40°) = 1.6 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(40°) = 1.6 * sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, we can take the inverse sine (sin^(-1)) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = sin^(-1) (sin(40°) / 1.6)\n\nθ2 ≈ 23.6 degrees\n\nSo the angle of the refracted ray is approximately 23.6 degrees."
