    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nSince there are 300 turns in the coil, the total magnetic field will be 300 times the magnetic field due to a single loop. Therefore, we can modify the formula as follows:\n\nB_total = 300 * (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nR = 0.12 m (converting from cm to m)\nI = 5 A\nx = 0.15 m (converting from cm to m)\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB_total = 300 * ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5 A) * (0.12 m)²) / (2 * ((0.12 m)² + (0.15 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nCalculating the magnetic field:\n\nB_total ≈ 300 * ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (5 A) * (0.0144 m²)) / (2 * (0.0336 m²)^(3/2))\nB_total ≈ 300 * (6.2832 × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (2 * 0.0986 m³)\nB_total ≈ 1.878 × 10^(-4) T / 0.1972\nB_total ≈ 0.000952 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil located 15 cm away from the center of the coil is approximately 0.000952 T or 0.952 mT."
