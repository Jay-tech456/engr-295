Assume that the mass of alpha particle and gold nucleus are 6.64 x 10^-27 kg and 3.29 x 10^-25 kg respectively, and the distance of closest approach is half the wavelength of the alpha particle.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum potential energy required for an alpha particle to approach a gold nucleus closely enough to be scattered through an angle of 180 degrees, we can use the formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two charged particles:\n\nU = (k * q1 * q2) / r\n\nwhere U is the potential energy, k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the alpha particle and gold nucleus, and r is the distance of closest approach.\n\nThe alpha particle has a charge of +2e (where e is the elementary charge, 1.6 x 10^-19 C), and the gold nucleus has a charge of +79e. Therefore, q1 = 2e and q2 = 79e.\n\nNow, we need to find the distance of closest approach (r). The problem states that the distance of closest approach is half the wavelength of the alpha particle. To find the wavelength, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the alpha particle. The momentum can be calculated using the mass (m) and velocity (v) of the alpha particle:\n\np = m * v\n\nSince we don't have the velocity of the alpha particle, we can't directly calculate the wavelength. However, we can still express the distance of closest approach in terms of the wavelength:\n\nr = λ / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the potential energy formula:\n\nU = (k * (2e) * (79e)) / (λ / 2)\n\nU = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2 * (2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (79 * 1.6 x 10^-19 C)) / (λ / 2)\n\nU = (8.99 x 10^9 * 3.2 x 10^-19 * 126.4 x 10^-19) / (λ / 2)\n\nU = (8.99 x 10^9 * 404.48 x 10^-38) / (λ / 2)\n\nU = (3.636 x 10^-28) / (λ / 2)\n\nNow, we have the potential energy in terms of the wavelength of the alpha particle. Unfortunately, without knowing the velocity of the alpha particle, we cannot calculate the exact value of the potential energy. However, this expression gives us a way to relate the potential energy to the wavelength of the alpha particle."
