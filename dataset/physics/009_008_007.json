    "message_2": "To draw the ray diagram and locate the position of the image formed, we will use the following three principal rays:\n\n1. A ray parallel to the principal axis, which after passing through the lens, goes through the focal point on the other side.\n2. A ray passing through the center of the lens, which continues undeviated.\n3. A ray passing through the focal point on the object side, which after passing through the lens, becomes parallel to the principal axis.\n\nNow, let's find the position of the image formed using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven, f = 10 cm and u = -25 cm (object distance is taken as negative for a real object). Substituting these values in the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/v - 1/(-25)\n1/10 + 1/25 = 1/v\n(5 + 2) / 50 = 1/v\n7/50 = 1/v\n\nNow, taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 50/7\nv ≈ 7.14 cm\n\nSince the value of v is positive, the image formed is real and on the opposite side of the lens.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification produced by the lens. The magnification formula is:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nSubstituting the values of v and u:\n\nm = -(7.14)/(-25)\nm ≈ 0.29\n\nThe magnification produced by the lens is approximately 0.29, which means the image is reduced in size compared to the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed is real, inverted, and reduced in size with a magnification of approximately 0.29."
