    "message_1": "You are provided with a current-carrying coil which has a radius of 5 cm and 20 turns. If the current flowing through the coil is 2.5 A, what is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the coil on its axis?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the current-carrying coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 2.5 A\nN = 20 turns\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A * 20 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2.5 * 20 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1 × 10^(-5) * 50) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-4) / (2 * 0.0559)\n\nB ≈ 0.00447 T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the coil on its axis is approximately 0.00447 T (Tesla).\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it follows the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current flow (counterclockwise when looking from above), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing upwards along the axis of the coil."
