    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite an electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n = 1) to the n = 3 energy level, we can use the energy level formula for hydrogen:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/n^2)\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n = 1) and the energy of the n = 3 energy level.\n\nE1 = -13.6 eV * (1/1^2) = -13.6 eV\nE3 = -13.6 eV * (1/3^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/9) = -1.51 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference between these two levels, which is the energy required to excite the electron:\n\nΔE = E3 - E1 = -1.51 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 12.09 eV\n\nTo convert this energy to joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^(-19) J:\n\nΔE = 12.09 eV * (1.6 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 1.934 x 10^(-18) J\n\nNow, let's determine the wavelength of the photon that is emitted when the electron transitions back down to the ground state. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.934 x 10^(-18) J)\n\nλ = 1.028 x 10^(-7) m\n\nConverting to nanometers (1 m = 10^9 nm):\n\nλ = 1.028 x 10^(-7) m * (10^9 nm/m) = 102.8 nm\n\nSo, the energy required to excite the electron from the ground state to the n = 3 energy level is 1.934 x 10^(-18) J (or 12.09 eV), and the wavelength of the photon emitted when the electron transitions back down to the ground state is 102.8 nm."
