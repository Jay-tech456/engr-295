    "message_1": "A physics student is required to determine the buoyant force acting on a cubical box of dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm when it is completely submerged in water. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³ and the density of the box material is 5000 kg/m³. (Assuming acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s²)",
    "message_2": "To determine the buoyant force acting on the cubical box, we can use the Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the cubical box:\nVolume = length × width × height\nSince the dimensions are given in centimeters, let's convert them to meters:\n10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nVolume = 0.1 m × 0.1 m × 0.1 m = 0.001 m³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the water displaced by the box:\nMass of water displaced = Volume × Density of water\nMass of water displaced = 0.001 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ = 1 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the water displaced, which is equal to the buoyant force acting on the box:\nWeight of water displaced = Mass × Acceleration due to gravity\nBuoyant force = 1 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 9.8 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the cubical box when it is completely submerged in water is 9.8 N."
