    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency heard by the observer according to the relativistic wave Doppler effect, we can use the following formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the frequency heard by the observer,\nf_emitted is the frequency of the sound wave emitted by the object (500 Hz),\nv is the speed of the object (0.6c),\nc is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_observed = 500 * (1 + 0.6) / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)\nf_observed = 500 * (1.6) / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nf_observed = 800 / sqrt(0.64)\nf_observed = 800 / 0.8\nf_observed = 1000 Hz\n\nThe frequency heard by the observer according to the relativistic wave Doppler effect is 1000 Hz."
