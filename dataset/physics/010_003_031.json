    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a pipe:\n\nQ = (π * ΔP * r^4) / (8 * η * L)\n\nwhere Q is the volumetric flow rate, ΔP is the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe, r is the radius of the pipe, η is the viscosity of the fluid, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nDiameter of the pipe, d = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converted to meters)\nRadius of the pipe, r = d/2 = 0.025 m\nViscosity of the fluid, η = 0.1 Pa.s\nPressure difference, ΔP = 10 kPa = 10000 Pa (converted to Pascals)\n\nWe are not given the length of the pipe, L. However, we can still find the volumetric flow rate per unit length of the pipe:\n\nQ/L = (π * ΔP * r^4) / (8 * η)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nQ/L = (π * 10000 * (0.025)^4) / (8 * 0.1)\nQ/L ≈ 0.122 m³/s per meter of pipe length\n\nTo find the volume of fluid that flows through the pipe in 5 minutes, we need to multiply the flow rate per unit length by the time:\n\nVolume = (Q/L) * time\nVolume = 0.122 * 5 * 60\nVolume ≈ 36.6 m³\n\nSo, 36.6 cubic meters of fluid will flow through the pipe in 5 minutes per meter of pipe length."
