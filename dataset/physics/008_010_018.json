    "message_2": "The CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix is a unitary matrix that describes the mixing between the quark flavor eigenstates in the Standard Model of particle physics. The matrix element V_{us} represents the mixing between the up (u) and strange (s) quarks.\n\nThe numerical value of the magnitude of the CKM matrix element V_{us} is not a fixed constant but rather an experimentally determined value with some uncertainty. The current best estimate for the magnitude of V_{us} is approximately 0.2243, with a small uncertainty.\n\nIt is important to note that this value may be updated as more precise experimental measurements become available. You can find the latest values for the CKM matrix elements in the Particle Data Group (PDG) Review of Particle Physics, which is updated regularly."
