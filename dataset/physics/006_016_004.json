    "message_2": "To calculate the NMR frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γ * B\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio (γ) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nγ = μ / ħ\n\nwhere μ is the nuclear magnetic moment (2.7927 x 10^-23 J/T) and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 x 10^-34 J*s).\n\nγ = (2.7927 x 10^-23 J/T) / (1.0545718 x 10^-34 J*s)\nγ ≈ 26.5 x 10^7 rad/s/T\n\nNow we can calculate the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = (26.5 x 10^7 rad/s/T) * (2.34 T)\nω ≈ 62.01 x 10^7 rad/s\n\nTo convert the angular frequency to the linear frequency (f), we can use the following equation:\n\nf = ω / 2π\n\nf = (62.01 x 10^7 rad/s) / (2π)\nf ≈ 9.87 x 10^7 Hz\n\nSo, the NMR frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 2.34 tesla is approximately 98.7 MHz."
