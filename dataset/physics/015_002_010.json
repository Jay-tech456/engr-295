    "message_2": "To determine the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the following equation:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere:\n- f is the frequency of the gravitational waves\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the total mass of the neutron star merger (in this case, 2.6 solar masses)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the total mass of the neutron star merger from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 2.6 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.1714 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.1714 x 10^30 kg * π)\n\nf ≈ 1.813 x 10^24 m^3/s^3 / (3.449 x 10^20 kg * π)\n\nf ≈ 1.813 x 10^24 m^3/s^3 / (1.083 x 10^21 kg)\n\nf ≈ 1.674 x 10^3 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger is approximately 1.674 kHz. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency may vary depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbit."
