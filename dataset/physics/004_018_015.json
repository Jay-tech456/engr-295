    "message_1": "A satellite in Earth's orbit is transmitting signals back to Earth. Due to the gravitational redshift effect, the frequency of the signal is slightly shifted by a factor of 0.0002. If the frequency of the signal when transmitted is 10 MHz, what is the frequency of the signal received on Earth? (Assume an average distance between Earth and the satellite of 35,786 km and that the mass of Earth is 5.97 x 10^24 kg.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the signal received on Earth, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nf_received = f_transmitted * (1 - z)\n\nwhere f_received is the frequency received on Earth, f_transmitted is the frequency transmitted by the satellite, and z is the redshift factor.\n\nGiven the problem, f_transmitted = 10 MHz and z = 0.0002.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf_received = 10 MHz * (1 - 0.0002)\nf_received = 10 MHz * 0.9998\nf_received = 9.998 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the signal received on Earth is approximately 9.998 MHz."
