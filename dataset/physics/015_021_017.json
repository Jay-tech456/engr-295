    "message_2": "The waveform of gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk is influenced by several factors, including the mass of the black hole and the accretion rate of the disk. Let's discuss how these factors affect the waveform.\n\n1. Mass of the black hole:\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, the frequency of the gravitational waves decreases. This is because the size of the black hole's event horizon increases with its mass, which in turn affects the orbital period of the matter in the accretion disk. The larger the black hole, the longer the orbital period, and thus the lower the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\n2. Accretion rate of the disk:\nThe accretion rate of the disk influences the intensity (amplitude) of the gravitational waves. A higher accretion rate means more matter is falling into the black hole, which leads to an increase in the energy emitted as gravitational waves. Consequently, the amplitude of the waveform increases with a higher accretion rate.\n\nIn summary, as the mass of the black hole increases, the frequency of the gravitational waves decreases, while the amplitude of the waveform increases with a higher accretion rate. However, it is important to note that the waveform of gravitational waves from a black hole accretion disk is complex and depends on various factors, including the geometry and dynamics of the disk, the black hole's spin, and the interaction between the black hole and the surrounding environment."
