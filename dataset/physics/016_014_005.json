    "message_2": "The maximum magnetic field that can be achieved by a superconducting magnet depends on the critical magnetic field (Hc) of the superconducting material used. The critical magnetic field is the maximum magnetic field a superconductor can withstand before it loses its superconducting properties and transitions back to a normal conducting state. This critical magnetic field is dependent on the temperature and material properties of the superconductor.\n\nThe critical magnetic field can be described by the empirical relation:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field at absolute zero temperature, T is the temperature, and Tc is the critical temperature of the superconductor.\n\nDifferent superconducting materials have different critical magnetic fields and critical temperatures. For example, low-temperature superconductors (LTS) like niobium-titanium (NbTi) and niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) have critical magnetic fields in the range of 10-30 tesla. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) like yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) and bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) can withstand higher magnetic fields, with critical magnetic fields reaching up to 100 tesla or more.\n\nThe maximum magnetic field achievable by a superconducting magnet also depends on the design and engineering of the magnet, such as the geometry of the superconducting coils, the cooling system, and the stability of the magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, the maximum magnetic field that can be achieved by a superconducting magnet depends on the critical magnetic field of the superconducting material, which is influenced by the temperature and material properties of the superconductor. The design and engineering of the magnet also play a crucial role in achieving high magnetic fields."
