    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop is a square, we can take advantage of its symmetry and calculate the magnetic field produced by one side of the square and then multiply it by 4.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The length of the side is L = 0.1 meters, and the current is I = 2 amperes. The distance from the center of the loop to point P is r = 0.05 meters.\n\nWe can calculate the magnetic field dB produced by a small segment dl of the wire at point P using the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the line connecting the segment dl to point P, and r is the distance from the segment dl to point P.\n\nFor a square loop, the angle θ varies along the side of the square. To find the total magnetic field produced by one side of the square, we need to integrate dB over the entire length of the side:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nSince the loop is symmetric, the magnetic field at point P produced by all four sides of the square is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following substitution:\n\nLet x be the distance from the center of the side to the segment dl. Then, r² = x² + (L/2)², and sinθ = (L/2) / r. Also, dl = dx.\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * dx * (L/2)) / (4 * π * (x² + (L/2)²)^(3/2))\n\nThe limits of integration are from -L/2 to L/2.\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * L) / (8 * π) * ∫(dx) / (x² + (L/2)²)^(3/2) from -L/2 to L/2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nu = x / (L/2), so x = u * (L/2) and dx = (L/2) * du\n\nThe limits of integration become -1 to 1.\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * L) / (8 * π) * ∫((L/2) * du) / ((u * (L/2))² + (L/2)²)^(3/2)\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * L) / (8 * π) * (1 / (L/2)) * ∫(du) / (u² + 1)^(3/2) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * ∫(du) / (u² + 1)^(3/2) from -1 to 1\n\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * (2 / (3 * sqrt(2)))\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = (μ₀ * I) / (π) * (2 / (3 * sqrt(2)))\n\nSubstitute the values of μ₀ and I:\n\nB_total = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 2 A) / (π) * (2 / (3 * sqrt(2)))\n\nB_total ≈ 1.52 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.52 × 10⁻⁶ T."
