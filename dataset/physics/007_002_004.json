    "message_2": "To find the half-life of the radioactive sample, we can use the decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the activity at time t, N0 is the initial activity, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life.\n\nWe are given that the activity decays from 1200 Bq to 300 Bq in 5 days. Plugging in the values:\n\n300 = 1200 * (1/2)^(5/T)\n\nDivide both sides by 1200:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(5/T)\n\nNow, we need to solve for T. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = ln((1/2)^(5/T))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can bring the exponent down:\n\nln(0.25) = (5/T) * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = 5 * ln(1/2) / ln(0.25)\n\nT ≈ 5 * (-0.6931) / (-1.3863)\n\nT ≈ 2.5 days\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive sample is approximately 2.5 days.\n\nAs for the time it takes to decay completely, it's important to note that radioactive decay is a continuous process, and theoretically, it never reaches zero. However, we can find the time it takes for the activity to become negligible or reach a certain threshold.\n\nFor example, let's find the time it takes for the activity to drop below 1 Bq. Using the decay formula:\n\n1 = 1200 * (1/2)^(t/2.5)\n\nDivide both sides by 1200:\n\n0.0008333 ≈ (1/2)^(t/2.5)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.0008333) ≈ (t/2.5) * ln(1/2)\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt ≈ 2.5 * ln(0.0008333) / ln(1/2)\n\nt ≈ 16.6 days\n\nSo, it would take approximately 16.6 days for the activity to drop below 1 Bq."
