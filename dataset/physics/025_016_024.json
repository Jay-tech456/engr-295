    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate to Fructose-6-phosphate in glycolysis at 37°C, we need to know the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction and the concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate to Fructose-6-phosphate is reported to be approximately +1.7 kJ/mol.\n\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310.15 K), and Q is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products and reactants at a given time.\n\nQ = [Fructose-6-phosphate] / [Glucose-6-phosphate]\n\nHowever, without the actual concentrations of Glucose-6-phosphate and Fructose-6-phosphate, we cannot calculate the exact value of ΔG for this reaction. If you provide the concentrations, I can help you calculate the ΔG value."
