    "message_2": "Let's denote the density of water as ρ_w. Since the ice cube is floating, we can use the principle of buoyancy, which states that the buoyant force acting on the object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In this case, the buoyant force acting on the ice cube is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the 90% submerged volume of the ice cube.\n\nLet V be the volume of the ice cube. The mass of the ice cube (m_ice) can be calculated as:\n\nm_ice = density_ice × V = 917 kg/m³ × V\n\nThe weight of the ice cube (W_ice) can be calculated as:\n\nW_ice = m_ice × g = 917 kg/m³ × V × g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nNow, let's consider the buoyant force acting on the ice cube. The volume of water displaced by the ice cube (V_displaced) is 90% of the ice cube's volume:\n\nV_displaced = 0.9 × V\n\nThe mass of the displaced water (m_displaced) can be calculated as:\n\nm_displaced = ρ_w × V_displaced = ρ_w × 0.9 × V\n\nThe buoyant force (F_buoyant) acting on the ice cube is equal to the weight of the displaced water:\n\nF_buoyant = m_displaced × g = ρ_w × 0.9 × V × g\n\nAccording to the principle of buoyancy, the weight of the ice cube is equal to the buoyant force acting on it:\n\nW_ice = F_buoyant\n\nSo, we can write:\n\n917 kg/m³ × V × g = ρ_w × 0.9 × V × g\n\nSince V and g are non-zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by V × g:\n\n917 kg/m³ = ρ_w × 0.9\n\nNow, we can solve for the density of water (ρ_w):\n\nρ_w = (917 kg/m³) / 0.9\n\nρ_w ≈ 1019 kg/m³\n\nTherefore, the density of the water is approximately 1019 kg/m³."
