    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as observed by an Earth observer, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length observed by the Earth observer, L0 is the proper length of the spaceship (its length when measured at rest), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nL0 = 200 meters\nv = 0.6c\n\nWe need to find L.\n\nStep 1: Calculate v^2/c^2\n(0.6c)^2 / c^2 = 0.36c^2 / c^2 = 0.36\n\nStep 2: Calculate 1 - v^2/c^2\n1 - 0.36 = 0.64\n\nStep 3: Calculate the square root of the result from Step 2\nsqrt(0.64) = 0.8\n\nStep 4: Multiply the proper length (L0) by the result from Step 3 to find the contracted length (L)\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 200 meters * 0.8 = 160 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as observed by an Earth observer is 160 meters."
