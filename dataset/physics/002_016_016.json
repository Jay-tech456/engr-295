    "message_2": "The critical temperature of water at its triple point cannot be directly calculated using the given information about the triple point pressure and critical pressure. However, we can provide the known values for the critical temperature and the triple point temperature of water.\n\nThe critical temperature (Tc) of water is the temperature above which it is impossible to liquefy water, no matter how much pressure is applied. The known value for the critical temperature of water is:\n\nTc = 647.3 K\n\nThe triple point of water is the unique temperature and pressure at which all three phases of water (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist in equilibrium. The known value for the triple point temperature of water is:\n\nTt = 273.16 K\n\nThese values are experimentally determined and cannot be calculated directly from the given information about the triple point pressure and critical pressure."
