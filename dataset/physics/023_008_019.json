    "message_1": "Here's a specific problem related to quantum computing and quantum teleportation that a physics student can solve:\n\nA quantum system consists of two qubits in an entangled state. One of the qubits is given to Alice, who is located far away from the other qubit held by Bob. Alice wants to teleport the state of her qubit to Bob's qubit using quantum teleportation protocol. If Alice and Bob share a Bell state, |Φ+⟩=(|00⟩+|11⟩)/√2, then determine the state of Bob's qubit after Alice performs a Bell-basis measurement on her qubits and sends the measurement results to Bob.",
    "message_2": "Let the state of Alice's qubit be |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers such that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1. The total state of the system, including Alice's qubit, the entangled qubit shared with Bob, and Bob's qubit, can be written as:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩ ⊗ |Φ+⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = (α|000⟩ + α|011⟩ + β|100⟩ + β|111⟩)/√2\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell-basis measurement on her qubits (the first two qubits in the expression above). The Bell states are:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2\n|Φ-⟩ = (|00⟩ - |11⟩)/√2\n|Ψ+⟩ = (|01⟩ + |10⟩)/√2\n|Ψ-⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩)/√2\n\nThe state |Ψ⟩ can be rewritten in terms of the Bell states:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = (α|Φ+⟩ + β|Ψ+⟩) ⊗ |0⟩ + (α|Φ-⟩ + β|Ψ-⟩) ⊗ |1⟩\n\nAfter Alice's measurement, the state of the system collapses to one of the four terms above, depending on the outcome of the measurement. Alice then sends the result of her measurement to Bob using classical communication.\n\n1. If Alice measures |Φ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, which is the desired state.\n2. If Alice measures |Φ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in state α|0⟩ - β|1⟩. Bob can apply a Z-gate to correct the state to α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.\n3. If Alice measures |Ψ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in state β|0⟩ + α|1⟩. Bob can apply an X-gate to correct the state to α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.\n4. If Alice measures |Ψ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in state β|0⟩ - α|1⟩. Bob can apply both X and Z gates to correct the state to α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.\n\nIn each case, Bob can apply the appropriate gates to obtain the desired state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, which is the state of Alice's original qubit. Thus, the state of Bob's qubit after Alice performs a Bell-basis measurement and sends the measurement results to Bob is α|0⟩ + β|1⟩."
