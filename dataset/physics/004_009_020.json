    "message_2": "In the Kerr metric, the stability of a rotating black hole is determined by its dimensionless spin parameter, which is defined as:\n\na* = J / (GM^2/c)\n\nwhere J is the angular momentum of the black hole, M is its mass, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor a black hole to remain stable and not break apart due to centrifugal forces, the dimensionless spin parameter must be less than or equal to 1. In other words, a* ≤ 1. This is known as the Kerr bound or the cosmic censorship conjecture.\n\nWhen a* = 1, the black hole is called an extremal black hole, and it is rotating at the maximum possible rate without breaking apart. In this case, the event horizon and the inner Cauchy horizon coincide, and the black hole has no inner region.\n\nThe value of the dimensionless spin parameter does not depend on the mass of the black hole, as it is a dimensionless quantity. However, the actual angular momentum J and the spin rate (angular velocity) of the black hole do depend on its mass. The angular velocity of a black hole can be expressed as:\n\nΩ = (GM)/(a*(GM/c^2)^2 + (GM/c^2))\n\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, the angular velocity decreases, assuming the dimensionless spin parameter remains constant. This means that more massive black holes rotate more slowly than less massive ones, given the same dimensionless spin parameter."
