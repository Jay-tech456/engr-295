    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a disc of radius R carrying a steady current I, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a disc of radius R, we can consider a small circular loop of radius r (where r < R) and thickness dr as the current element. The length of this loop is dl = 2πr. The magnetic field dB at the center of the disc due to this loop is perpendicular to the plane of the loop and can be calculated as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * 2πr * dr) / r²\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = R) gives the total magnetic field B at the center of the disc:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 2) * (I * r * dr) / r² from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * ∫(r * dr) / r² from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * ∫(1 / r) dr from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * [ln(r)] from 0 to R\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * (ln(R) - ln(0))\n\nSince ln(0) is undefined, we can consider the limit as r approaches 0:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * lim (r -> 0) (ln(R) - ln(r))\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * ln(R)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field for the specific case where the disc radius is 0.05 m and the current is 10 A:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A / 2) * ln(0.05 m)\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-6) T * ln(0.05)\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-6) T * (-2.9957)\n\nB ≈ -3.765 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the disc is approximately -3.765 × 10^(-6) T."
