    "message_2": "The compressibility factor (Z) is a dimensionless quantity that is used to describe the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior. For an ideal gas, the compressibility factor is equal to 1. The equation for the compressibility factor is:\n\nZ = (P * V) / (n * R * T)\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of nitrogen gas in the sample. We can use the ideal gas law equation for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWe are given P = 10 atm, V = 2 L, R = 0.0821 L atm / (K mol), and T = 500 K. We can solve for n:\n\nn = PV / (RT) = (10 atm * 2 L) / (0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 500 K) = 20 / 41.05 = 0.487 moles\n\nNow we can calculate the compressibility factor (Z) using the equation:\n\nZ = (P * V) / (n * R * T) = (10 atm * 2 L) / (0.487 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 500 K)\n\nZ = 20 / (0.487 * 41.05) = 20 / 20 = 1\n\nSince we assumed the nitrogen gas to be an ideal gas, the compressibility factor (Z) is equal to 1."
