    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity (k) of the copper rod, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = (k * A * ΔT * t) / L\n\nWhere:\nQ = heat transfer (W)\nk = thermal conductivity (W/m·K)\nA = cross-sectional area of the rod (m^2)\nΔT = temperature difference between the ends (K)\nt = time (s)\nL = length of the rod (m)\n\nHowever, we need to find the heat transfer (Q) first. We can use the formula for electrical power (P) to find the heat transfer:\n\nP = I^2 * R\n\nWhere:\nP = power (W)\nI = current (A)\nR = resistance (Ω)\n\nThe resistance (R) of the copper rod can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = (ρ * L) / A\n\nWhere:\nρ = resistivity of copper (Ω·m)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cross-sectional area (A) of the rod:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2\nA = π * (0.05 m / 2)^2\nA ≈ 0.0019635 m^2\n\nNow, let's calculate the resistance (R) of the rod:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ω·m * 1 m) / 0.0019635 m^2\nR ≈ 8.56 × 10^-6 Ω\n\nAssuming a steady-state condition, the heat transfer (Q) is equal to the electrical power (P). We can rearrange the formula for electrical power to solve for the current (I):\n\nI = sqrt(P / R)\n\nSince we don't have the value for the electrical power (P), we can't find the current (I) and the heat transfer (Q). Therefore, we can't calculate the thermal conductivity (k) of the copper rod using the given information.\n\nHowever, the thermal conductivity of copper is a known value, and it is approximately 398 W/m·K at room temperature."
