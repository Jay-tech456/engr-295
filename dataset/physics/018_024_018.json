    "message_2": "The fine-structure constant, denoted by α (alpha), is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles. Its numerical value is approximately 1/137 or specifically, α ≈ 0.0072973525693.\n\nExperimental measurements of the fine-structure constant can be improved to achieve greater precision in high-energy physics research through various methods:\n\n1. Improved experimental techniques: Utilizing more advanced and precise equipment, such as atomic clocks and interferometers, can lead to more accurate measurements of quantities related to the fine-structure constant, such as the electron's magnetic moment and the Rydberg constant.\n\n2. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations: The fine-structure constant can be determined through comparisons of experimental results with theoretical predictions from QED. Improving the precision of QED calculations can lead to a more accurate determination of the fine-structure constant.\n\n3. Atomic and molecular spectroscopy: High-resolution spectroscopy of atomic and molecular transitions can provide precise measurements of energy levels, which can be used to determine the fine-structure constant. Advances in laser technology and spectroscopic techniques can lead to more accurate measurements.\n\n4. Comparison with other fundamental constants: The fine-structure constant can be related to other fundamental constants, such as the speed of light, the Planck constant, and the elementary charge. Improving the precision of measurements for these constants can indirectly lead to a more accurate determination of the fine-structure constant.\n\n5. International collaboration and data sharing: Collaborating with researchers worldwide and sharing data from various experiments can help improve the overall precision of the fine-structure constant determination by combining results from different methods and reducing systematic uncertainties."
