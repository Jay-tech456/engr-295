    "message_2": "Quantum cosmology is a field that attempts to apply the principles of quantum mechanics to the study of the early universe. One of the main goals of quantum cosmology is to provide a more complete and consistent description of the initial state of the universe, which is currently described by the Big Bang theory.\n\nThe predicted initial state of the universe according to quantum cosmology is often referred to as the \"wave function of the universe.\" This wave function is a mathematical description of the probabilities associated with different possible initial states of the universe. One of the most well-known models in quantum cosmology is the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal, which suggests that the universe began as a closed, finite space with no initial singularity (i.e., no \"Big Bang\" point). Instead, the universe emerged smoothly from an initial state in which space and time were indistinguishable.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the thermal radiation left over from the early universe, and it provides crucial observational evidence for our understanding of the universe's history. The CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, with a temperature of about 2.73 Kelvin, and it exhibits very small temperature fluctuations across the sky. These fluctuations are believed to be the result of tiny density variations in the early universe, which eventually led to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.\n\nThe predictions of quantum cosmology should, in principle, be consistent with the observed properties of the CMB. For example, the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal predicts a universe that is spatially closed and finite, which is consistent with the observed isotropy and homogeneity of the CMB. However, it is important to note that quantum cosmology is still a developing field, and many aspects of the theory remain speculative and not yet fully understood.\n\nIn summary, quantum cosmology aims to provide a more complete description of the initial state of the universe, and its predictions should be consistent with the observed properties of the early universe, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation. However, the field is still in development, and more research is needed to fully understand the implications of quantum cosmology for our understanding of the universe's history."
