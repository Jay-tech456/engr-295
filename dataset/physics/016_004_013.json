    "message_2": "To find the critical magnetic field strength required to destroy superconductivity in a lead wire, we need to use the formula for the critical magnetic field, which is given by:\n\nH_c(T) = H_c(0) * (1 - (T / T_c)^2)\n\nwhere H_c(T) is the critical magnetic field at temperature T, H_c(0) is the critical magnetic field at 0 K, and T_c is the critical temperature for the superconducting material.\n\nFor lead (Pb), the critical temperature T_c is approximately 7.2 K, and the critical magnetic field at 0 K, H_c(0), is approximately 6.5 x 10^4 A/m.\n\nGiven that the temperature T is 4.2 K, we can now calculate the critical magnetic field at this temperature:\n\nH_c(4.2) = 6.5 x 10^4 * (1 - (4.2 / 7.2)^2)\nH_c(4.2) = 6.5 x 10^4 * (1 - 0.3403)\nH_c(4.2) = 6.5 x 10^4 * 0.6597\nH_c(4.2) ≈ 4.29 x 10^4 A/m\n\nSo, the critical magnetic field strength required to destroy superconductivity in the lead wire at 4.2 K is approximately 4.29 x 10^4 A/m."
