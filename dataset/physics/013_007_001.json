    "message_2": "The mass distribution of the Milky Way galaxy can be broadly categorized into three main components: the central bulge, the disk, and the dark matter halo. Each of these components contributes to the overall mass of the galaxy and affects the motion of stars within it.\n\n1. Central Bulge: The central bulge of the Milky Way is a dense, roughly spherical region located at the center of the galaxy. It is composed primarily of old stars, gas, and dust, and has a mass of about 1-2 x 10^10 solar masses. The gravitational pull from the central bulge affects the motion of stars in its vicinity, causing them to move in elliptical orbits around the galactic center.\n\n2. Disk: The disk of the Milky Way is a flattened, rotating structure that extends outwards from the central bulge. It contains a mix of young and old stars, as well as gas and dust, and has a mass of about 4-6 x 10^10 solar masses. The disk is further divided into spiral arms, which are regions of higher density where star formation is more active. The motion of stars within the disk is influenced by the combined gravitational forces from the central bulge, the disk itself, and the dark matter halo. Stars in the disk generally follow nearly circular orbits around the galactic center, with their velocities increasing towards the outer regions of the disk due to the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Dark Matter Halo: The dark matter halo is an invisible, roughly spherical component that surrounds the entire Milky Way galaxy. Although it does not emit or absorb light, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of stars and gas within the galaxy. The dark matter halo is estimated to have a mass of about 1-2 x 10^12 solar masses, making it the most massive component of the Milky Way. Its gravitational influence plays a crucial role in determining the overall motion of stars within the galaxy, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where the effects of the central bulge and disk are weaker.\n\nThe motion of stars within the Milky Way is governed by the combined gravitational forces from these three components. The central bulge, disk, and dark matter halo each contribute to the overall gravitational potential, which in turn determines the velocities and orbits of stars within the galaxy. Understanding the mass distribution of the Milky Way and its effects on the motion of stars is essential for studying the formation, evolution, and dynamics of our galaxy."
