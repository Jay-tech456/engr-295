    "message_1": "A copper wire of length 2 meters and cross-sectional area 1 mm² has a resistivity of 1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm at room temperature. If a voltage of 12 V is applied across the length of the wire, what is the electrical current flowing through it?",
    "message_2": "To find the electrical current flowing through the wire, we first need to determine the resistance of the wire. We can use the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the cross-sectional area from mm² to m²:\n1 mm² = 1 × 10^-6 m²\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance:\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm) × (2 m) / (1 × 10^-6 m²)\nR = 33.6 × 10^-8 Ω\n\nNext, we can use Ohm's Law to find the electrical current:\nVoltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for current:\nI = V / R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\nI = 12 V / (33.6 × 10^-8 Ω)\nI = 12 V / 3.36 × 10^-7 Ω\nI = 35.71 A\n\nTherefore, the electrical current flowing through the wire is approximately 35.71 Amperes."
