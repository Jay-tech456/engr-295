    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It does not emit or absorb light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation, but its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. One of these effects is gravitational lensing, which occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy.\n\nThe effect of dark matter on the observed gravitational lensing of a galaxy cluster can be significant. Since dark matter is believed to contribute to the overall mass of galaxy clusters, it enhances the gravitational lensing effect. The presence of dark matter increases the total mass of the cluster, which in turn increases the strength of the gravitational field and the amount of light bending. This can lead to more pronounced lensing effects, such as multiple images, arcs, and rings of the background galaxies.\n\nTo observe the effect of dark matter on gravitational lensing in experiments, astronomers use a technique called weak gravitational lensing. This method involves measuring the small distortions in the shapes of background galaxies due to the gravitational influence of a foreground galaxy cluster. By analyzing the distribution of these distortions, astronomers can map the distribution of mass within the galaxy cluster, including the dark matter.\n\nAnother technique used to study dark matter through gravitational lensing is strong gravitational lensing. This occurs when the foreground mass is so large that it creates multiple images, arcs, or Einstein rings of the background galaxy. By studying the properties of these lensed images, such as their positions, shapes, and brightness, astronomers can infer the distribution of mass within the galaxy cluster, including the contribution of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, dark matter affects the observed gravitational lensing of a galaxy cluster by increasing the total mass of the cluster, which enhances the lensing effect. This can be observed in experiments through techniques like weak and strong gravitational lensing, which allow astronomers to map the distribution of mass within galaxy clusters and infer the presence of dark matter."
