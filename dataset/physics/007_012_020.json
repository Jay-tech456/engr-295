    "message_2": "In the nuclear fusion reaction, deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H) combine to form helium (⁴He) and a neutron (n), releasing energy in the process. The reaction can be represented as:\n\n²H + ³H → ⁴He + n + energy\n\nTo calculate the energy produced in this reaction, we first need to determine the number of moles of deuterium and tritium in 1 gram of each.\n\nDeuterium has an atomic mass of approximately 2 grams/mole, and tritium has an atomic mass of approximately 3 grams/mole. Therefore, the number of moles of deuterium and tritium in 1 gram of each is:\n\nmoles of deuterium = 1 g / 2 g/mole = 0.5 moles\nmoles of tritium = 1 g / 3 g/mole = 1/3 moles\n\nSince the reaction requires one mole of deuterium and one mole of tritium to produce one mole of helium, the limiting reactant is tritium. Thus, only 1/3 moles of deuterium will react with 1/3 moles of tritium.\n\nThe energy released per reaction is approximately 17.6 MeV (million electron volts). To convert this to joules, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nSo, 17.6 MeV = 17.6 x 10⁶ eV = 17.6 x 10⁶ x 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J ≈ 2.818 x 10⁻¹² J\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of reactions that will occur with 1/3 moles of tritium. Since 1 mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles (approximately 6.022 x 10²³ particles/mole), the number of tritium atoms in 1/3 moles is:\n\n(1/3) x 6.022 x 10²³ ≈ 2.007 x 10²³\n\nSince each reaction produces 2.818 x 10⁻¹² J of energy, the total energy produced by the fusion of 1 gram of deuterium and 1 gram of tritium is:\n\nEnergy = (2.007 x 10²³ reactions) x (2.818 x 10⁻¹² J/reaction) ≈ 5.656 x 10¹¹ J\n\nSo, approximately 5.656 x 10¹¹ joules of energy is produced in the fusion of 1 gram of deuterium and 1 gram of tritium."
