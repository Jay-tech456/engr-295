    "message_2": "The Auger effect probability is not a straightforward value to calculate, as it depends on various factors such as the atomic number, the specific electron shell, and the energy of the ejected electron. However, we can discuss the process and how to determine the energy and type of the resulting Auger electron and the emitted secondary electron.\n\nWhen a K-shell electron is ejected from a Helium atom, it leaves a vacancy in the K-shell. This vacancy can be filled by an electron from a higher energy shell (L-shell in the case of Helium). When this transition occurs, the excess energy can be released in one of two ways: either by emitting a photon (X-ray fluorescence) or by transferring the energy to another electron in the atom, causing it to be ejected (Auger effect).\n\nIn the case of the Auger effect, the ejected electron is called the Auger electron, and the emitted secondary electron is the same electron. The energy of the Auger electron can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_Auger = E_initial - E_transition - E_binding\n\nwhere E_initial is the initial energy of the ejected K-shell electron (28 eV), E_transition is the energy difference between the K and L shells, and E_binding is the binding energy of the L-shell electron.\n\nFor Helium, the energy difference between the K and L shells is approximately 24.6 eV, and the binding energy of the L-shell electron is around 5.4 eV. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nE_Auger = 28 eV - 24.6 eV - 5.4 eV = -2 eV\n\nSince the energy of the Auger electron is negative, this indicates that the Auger effect is not energetically favorable in this case, and the excess energy will likely be released through X-ray fluorescence instead.\n\nHowever, if the initial energy of the ejected K-shell electron were higher, the Auger effect could become energetically favorable, and the energy of the emitted Auger electron would be positive. In such a case, the type of the Auger electron would be an L-shell electron, as it is the electron that fills the K-shell vacancy and transfers its energy to another electron in the atom."
