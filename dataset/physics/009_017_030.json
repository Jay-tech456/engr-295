    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for the angular position of minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m and the slit width a = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m, we can find the angular position of the first minimum (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 5 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(5 * 10^(-6))\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 2.87 * 10^(-4) radians\n\nTo convert this to degrees, we can use the conversion factor 180°/π:\n\nθ ≈ (2.87 * 10^(-4) * 180) / π\nθ ≈ 0.0165°\n\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction pattern is approximately 0.0165°."
