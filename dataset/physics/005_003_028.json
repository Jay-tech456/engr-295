Another spaceship is moving towards the first spaceship with a velocity of 0.8c relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first one? (Assume that the velocity addition should be calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula.)",
    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity of the second spaceship with respect to the first one, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v_rel is the relative velocity, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, v1 = 0.9c and v2 = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv_rel = (0.8c - 0.9c) / (1 - (0.9c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.72c^2 / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.72)\n\nv_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.28\n\nv_rel = -0.3571c\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the second spaceship is moving towards the first spaceship. So, the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first one is approximately -0.3571c or 0.3571c towards the first spaceship."
