    "message_1": "A rectangular wire loop of width 5 cm and length 10 cm is carrying a current of 2 A. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 4 cm away from the center of the loop on its axis.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a rectangular wire loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a * b) / (2 * π * (a^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a and b are the width and length of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the loop and the current, we can plug in the values:\n\na = 0.05 m (5 cm converted to meters)\nb = 0.10 m (10 cm converted to meters)\nI = 2 A\nx = 0.04 m (4 cm converted to meters)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.05 m * 0.10 m) / (2 * π * (0.05^2 + 0.04^2)^(3/2))\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.05 * 0.10) / (2 * π * (0.0025 + 0.0016)^(3/2))\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.05 * 0.10) / (2 * π * 0.0041^(3/2))\nB ≈ 1.15 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing in a rectangular loop, the magnetic field will be in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the loop. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current flow and curl your fingers, the direction of your fingers will represent the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing either into or out of the plane of the loop, depending on the direction of the current flow.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located 4 cm away from the center of the loop on its axis is approximately 1.15 × 10^(-5) T, and the direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop."
