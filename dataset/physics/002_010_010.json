    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to vaporize the water, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × specific latent heat of vaporization (L_v)\n\nGiven:\nmass (m) = 50 grams = 0.05 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams)\nspecific latent heat of vaporization (L_v) = 2.26 × 10^6 J/kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nQ = 0.05 kg × 2.26 × 10^6 J/kg\n\nQ = 1.13 × 10^5 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at 100°C is 1.13 × 10^5 Joules."
