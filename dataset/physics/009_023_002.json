    "message_1": "A physics student wants to analyze the polarization of light passing through a polarizer. She sets up an experiment where she shines unpolarized light on a polarizer and measures the intensity of the light transmitted through the polarizer. She rotates the polarizer from the original position while keeping the light intensity constant. After rotating the polarizer by a certain angle, the transmitted light intensity decreases to half of its original value. What is the angle between the original polarization direction of the light and the transmission axis of the polarizer according to Malus' Law?",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the polarization direction of the light. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted light intensity, I₀ is the initial light intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the polarization direction of the light.\n\nIn this case, the transmitted light intensity decreases to half of its original value, so we have:\n\nI = 0.5 * I₀\n\nNow, we can substitute this into Malus' Law:\n\n0.5 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I₀:\n\n0.5 = cos²(θ)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides:\n\nθ = arccos(1/sqrt(2))\n\nθ ≈ 45°\n\nSo, the angle between the original polarization direction of the light and the transmission axis of the polarizer is approximately 45°."
