    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 2 A\nR = 0.1 m (converted from 10 cm)\nx = 0.05 m (converted from 5 cm)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π x 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π x 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 6.4 x 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the loop is approximately 6.4 x 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
