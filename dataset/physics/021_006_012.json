    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole significantly affects the orbits of nearby stars and planets due to its immense gravitational pull. Here are the specific changes observed in each object's position, orbital period, and gravitational pull:\n\n1. Position: The strong gravitational force exerted by the black hole can cause nearby stars and planets to be attracted towards it. This can lead to changes in their positions and trajectories. In some cases, objects may be pulled into an orbit around the black hole, while in others, they may be ejected from their original orbits and flung out into space.\n\n2. Orbital period: The orbital period of an object is determined by the mass of the central body it orbits and the distance between the two objects. As the black hole's gravitational pull influences the nearby stars and planets, their orbital periods may change. Objects that are pulled closer to the black hole will experience a decrease in their orbital periods, as they will need to travel faster to maintain a stable orbit. Conversely, objects that are pushed farther away from the black hole will experience an increase in their orbital periods.\n\n3. Gravitational pull: The gravitational pull experienced by nearby stars and planets will increase as they get closer to the black hole. This can lead to tidal forces that can cause deformation, heating, and in extreme cases, the disintegration of the object. For objects that are in orbit around the black hole, the gravitational pull will vary depending on their distance from the black hole and their position in the orbit. This can lead to complex and chaotic orbital dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a black hole can significantly alter the positions, orbital periods, and gravitational pull experienced by nearby stars and planets. These changes can lead to complex and unpredictable orbital dynamics, as well as potential deformation or destruction of the objects due to the immense gravitational forces involved."
