    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm (focal length)\nu = -40 cm (object distance; negative because the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/(-40) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/20 = -1/40 + 1/v\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\nv = 40*(-1/20)\n\nv = -20 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is expected for a concave mirror. So, the image is formed 20 cm in front of the mirror.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -(-20)/(-40)\n\nM = 20/40\n\nM = 1/2\n\nThe magnification is 1/2, which means the image is half the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright."
