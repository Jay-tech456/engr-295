    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge of the plate, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^0.5\n\nwhere:\nx = distance from the leading edge of the plate (0.5 m in this case)\nν = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (0.00015 m^2/s)\nU = free stream velocity of the fluid (20 m/s)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.5 * (0.00015 / 20))^0.5\nδ = (2.5 * 0.0000075)^0.5\nδ = (0.00001875)^0.5\nδ ≈ 0.00433 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.00433 meters or 4.33 mm."
