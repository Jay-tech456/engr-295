    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer, we will use the Blasius solution for a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * (ν / U₀)^(1/2)) * 5\n\nwhere:\nx = distance from the leading edge of the plate (1 meter in this case)\nν = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (which can be calculated using the given dynamic viscosity and density of the fluid)\nU₀ = free stream velocity (5 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν). The given dynamic viscosity (μ) is 1.8 x 10^-5 Ns/m^2. To find the kinematic viscosity, we need the density (ρ) of the fluid. Unfortunately, the density is not provided in the problem statement. However, we can assume the fluid is air at room temperature, which has a density of approximately 1.2 kg/m³.\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinematic viscosity (ν) using the formula:\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nν = (1.8 x 10^-5 Ns/m^2) / (1.2 kg/m³)\nν ≈ 1.5 x 10^-5 m²/s\n\nNow that we have the kinematic viscosity, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ):\n\nδ = (1 * (1.5 x 10^-5 m²/s / 5 m/s)^(1/2)) * 5\nδ = (1 * (3 x 10^-6 m)^(1/2)) * 5\nδ ≈ (1 * 0.001732) * 5\nδ ≈ 0.00866 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 1 meter from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.00866 meters or 8.66 millimeters."
