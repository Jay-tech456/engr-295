    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of a coaxial cable carrying a current of 6 A, given that the inner conductor has a radius of 2 mm and the outer conductor has a radius of 6 mm? Assume that the cable is infinitely long and that the current is uniformly distributed throughout the inner conductor.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is symmetrical and parallel to the dl vector at every point on the loop. Therefore, the dot product (B⋅dl) becomes B * dl, and we can rewrite Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the loop, we can take B out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = B * (2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the distance from the center of the cable is 5 cm (0.05 m), which is greater than the outer conductor's radius (0.006 m), the loop encloses both the inner and outer conductors. The current in the inner conductor is 6 A, and the current in the outer conductor is -6 A (opposite direction). Therefore, the total current enclosed by the loop is 0 A.\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field:\n\nB * (2πr) = μ₀I\nB * (2π * 0.05) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 0\nB * (0.1π) = 0\n\nSince the total current enclosed by the loop is 0, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the coaxial cable is 0 T."
