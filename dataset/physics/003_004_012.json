    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a point on the axis of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nR = 0.1 m\nI = 2 A\nx = 0.2 m\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.04 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * 0.125 m³)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (0.25 m³)\n\nB ≈ 1.006 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a point 0.2 m away from the center of the loop on its axis is approximately 1.006 × 10^(-7) T."
