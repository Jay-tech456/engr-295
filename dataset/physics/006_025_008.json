    "message_2": "The minimum mass of fissionable material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction is called the critical mass. The critical mass depends on several factors, including the shape, purity, and density of the material, as well as the presence of any neutron-reflecting materials surrounding it.\n\nFor uranium-235, the critical mass is approximately 15-50 kg (33-110 lbs) under normal conditions. This range is due to the factors mentioned above. In practice, the critical mass can be reduced by using neutron reflectors or increasing the density of the material.\n\nIt is important to note that these values are approximate and can vary depending on the specific conditions and configurations."
