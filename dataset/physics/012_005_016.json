    "message_2": "To find the electron density of the plasma, we can use the plasma frequency formula:\n\nω_pe = √(ne * e^2 / (ε_0 * me))\n\nwhere ω_pe is the plasma frequency, ne is the electron density, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C), ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10^-12 F/m), and me is the electron mass (9.11 × 10^-31 kg).\n\nWe are given the plasma frequency (ω_pe) as 2.5 GHz, which we need to convert to rad/s:\n\nω_pe = 2.5 GHz * 2π * 10^9 = 15.7 × 10^9 rad/s\n\nNow we can solve for the electron density (ne):\n\nne = ω_pe^2 * ε_0 * me / e^2\n\nne = (15.7 × 10^9)^2 * (8.85 × 10^-12) * (9.11 × 10^-31) / (1.6 × 10^-19)^2\n\nne ≈ 1.01 × 10^18 m^-3\n\nThe electron density of the plasma is approximately 1.01 × 10^18 m^-3."
