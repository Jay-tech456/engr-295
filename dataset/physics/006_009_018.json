    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, λ' is the final wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the scattering angle θ. We can do this by using the conservation of energy:\n\nE_photon_initial + E_electron_initial = E_photon_final + E_electron_final\n\nThe initial energy of the electron is 0, so:\n\nE_photon_initial = E_photon_final + E_electron_final\n\nWe can express the photon energies in terms of their wavelengths:\n\nE_photon_initial = (h * c) / λ\nE_photon_final = (h * c) / λ'\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n(6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.1 x 10^-9 m) = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / λ' + 1.5 x 10^3 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV\n\nSolving for λ':\n\nλ' ≈ 0.1002 nm\n\nNow, we can find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = 0.1002 nm - 0.1 nm = 0.0002 nm\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of the X-ray photon when it undergoes Compton scattering off a free electron in a carbon atom is approximately 0.0002 nm."
