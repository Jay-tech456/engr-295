    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the velocity of the particle as seen by the moving observer. The Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nx' = γ(x - vt)\nt' = γ(t - vx/c^2)\n\nwhere x' and t' are the position and time coordinates in the moving observer's frame, x and t are the position and time coordinates in the laboratory frame, v is the relative velocity between the two frames, and γ is the Lorentz factor given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor for the observer moving at 0.6c in the positive y-direction:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ = 1.25\n\nNow, let's find the velocity of the particle in the x'-axis as seen by the moving observer. We can use the velocity addition formula:\n\nu'x = (ux - v) / (1 - ux*v/c^2)\n\nwhere ux is the velocity of the particle in the laboratory frame (0.8c), v is the relative velocity between the two frames (0.6c), and u'x is the velocity of the particle in the x'-axis as seen by the moving observer.\n\nu'x = (0.8c - 0) / (1 - 0.8c * 0/c^2)\nu'x = 0.8c\n\nSince the observer is moving in the positive y-direction, the velocity of the particle in the y'-axis as seen by the moving observer is the same as in the laboratory frame, which is 0.\n\nNow we have the velocity of the particle as seen by the moving observer: u'x = 0.8c and u'y = 0. The trajectory of the particle in the moving observer's frame is a straight line along the x'-axis with a constant velocity of 0.8c."
