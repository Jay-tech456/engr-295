    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. However, it is important to note that this is a highly simplified model and may not accurately represent the complex dynamics of a collapsing star. \n\nThe quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission is given by:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (d^3 Q/dt^3) / r\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, Q is the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nFor a collapsing star, the quadrupole moment can be approximated as:\n\nQ ~ M * R^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the star and R is its radius. The third time derivative of the quadrupole moment can be estimated as:\n\n(d^3 Q/dt^3) ~ M * R^2 * (2 * pi * f)^3\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational wave.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the mass and Schwarzschild radius of the collapsing star:\n\nM = 20 * M_sun = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nR_s = 60 km = 60 x 10^3 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is related to the mass of the black hole by the formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nWe can solve for the radius R of the collapsing star just before it becomes a black hole:\n\nR = (c^2 * R_s) / (2 * G * M)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nR ≈ 8.87 x 10^3 m\n\nNow, we can estimate the frequency of the gravitational wave:\n\nf ~ c / (2 * pi * R)\n\nf ≈ 5.38 x 10^3 Hz\n\nFinally, we can estimate the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (M * R^2 * (2 * pi * f)^3) / r\n\nAssuming the distance r is much larger than the radius R, the maximum amplitude h will be:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (M * R^2 * (2 * pi * f)^3)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nh ≈ 1.36 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the collapsing star is approximately 1.36 x 10^-22, and the frequency is approximately 5.38 x 10^3 Hz. Keep in mind that these are rough estimates based on a simplified model and should be taken with caution."
