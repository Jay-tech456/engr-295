    "message_1": "A heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures 600 K and 300 K respectively. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the heat engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two reservoirs at temperatures T1 (hot reservoir) and T2 (cold reservoir). It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T2 / T1)\n\nIn this case, T1 = 600 K and T2 = 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 600 K)\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - 0.5\n\nCarnot efficiency = 0.5 or 50%\n\nSo, the maximum possible efficiency for this heat engine is 50%."
