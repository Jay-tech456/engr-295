    "message_2": "In relativistic cosmology, the size of the observable universe can be calculated using the comoving distance formula. Assuming a flat universe, the comoving distance (D) is given by:\n\nD = c / H₀ * ∫[0, z] (1 / sqrt(Ωm * (1 + z')³ + ΩΛ)) dz'\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s), H₀ is the Hubble constant (70 km/s/Mpc in this case), Ωm is the matter density parameter, ΩΛ is the dark energy density parameter, and z is the redshift. For a flat universe, Ωm + ΩΛ = 1.\n\nThe current best estimates for the cosmological parameters are Ωm ≈ 0.3 and ΩΛ ≈ 0.7. The redshift (z) at the edge of the observable universe is approximately 1100.\n\nTo calculate the comoving distance, we need to evaluate the integral. This is a non-trivial task and usually requires numerical integration. Using a numerical integration method, the value of the integral is approximately 3.3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the comoving distance:\n\nD = (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) * 3.3 ≈ 14,100 Mpc\n\nHowever, this is the comoving distance, which does not take into account the expansion of the universe. To find the proper distance, we need to multiply the comoving distance by the scale factor (1 + z):\n\nProper distance = D * (1 + z) ≈ 14,100 Mpc * (1 + 1100) ≈ 14,100 Mpc * 1101 ≈ 15.5 billion light-years\n\nSo, the current size of the observable universe when viewed from Earth in relativistic cosmology, assuming a flat universe and a Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc, is approximately 15.5 billion light-years."
