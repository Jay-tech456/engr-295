    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum kinetic energy imparted to an electron by a linear accelerator, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = q * V\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, q is the charge of the electron, and V is the potential difference.\n\nThe charge of an electron (q) is approximately -1.6 × 10^(-19) C, and the potential difference (V) is given as 1 MV (1 × 10^6 V). Since we are interested in the magnitude of the kinetic energy, we can ignore the negative sign of the electron charge.\n\nK.E. = (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (1 × 10^6 V)\n\nK.E. = 1.6 × 10^(-13) J\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy imparted to an electron by a linear accelerator that is 1 km long with a potential difference of 1 MV is 1.6 × 10^(-13) Joules."
