    "message_2": "The maximum allowable dose of cosmic radiation that an astronaut can be exposed to during a space mission depends on the duration of the mission and the specific space agency's guidelines. For instance, NASA has set a career limit for astronauts at a 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to radiation-induced cancer. This translates to a dose limit of approximately 1 sievert (Sv) for a typical astronaut's career.\n\nTo minimize exposure to cosmic radiation, several radiation protection measures can be implemented:\n\n1. Shielding: Spacecraft can be designed with materials that provide effective shielding against cosmic radiation, such as aluminum, polyethylene, or other advanced materials. The thickness and composition of the shielding can be optimized to reduce the radiation dose.\n\n2. Space weather monitoring: By monitoring space weather conditions, astronauts can be alerted to periods of increased radiation levels, such as during solar flares or coronal mass ejections. During these events, astronauts can take shelter in a designated, more heavily shielded area of the spacecraft.\n\n3. Mission planning: The duration and timing of space missions can be planned to minimize exposure to cosmic radiation. For example, missions can be scheduled during periods of low solar activity or limited to shorter durations to reduce the overall radiation dose.\n\n4. Personal protective equipment: Astronauts can wear radiation-protective garments, such as vests made of high-density materials, to reduce their exposure to cosmic radiation.\n\n5. Pharmacological countermeasures: Research is ongoing to develop drugs that can help protect astronauts from the harmful effects of radiation exposure. These drugs could potentially reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer and other health issues.\n\nIn summary, the maximum allowable dose of cosmic radiation for astronauts is typically around 1 sievert over their career, and various radiation protection measures, such as shielding, space weather monitoring, mission planning, personal protective equipment, and pharmacological countermeasures, can be implemented to minimize this exposure."
