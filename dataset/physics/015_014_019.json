    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range and amplitude of gravitational waves (GWs) from a population of primordial black holes (PBHs), we need to consider the characteristics of the PBHs and the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\n1. Frequency range:\n\nThe frequency of the GWs emitted by a binary system of PBHs is determined by the orbital frequency of the system. The orbital frequency (f_orb) is related to the total mass (M) of the binary system and the orbital separation (a) as follows:\n\nf_orb = (1/2π) * √(G * M / a^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nFor PBHs with masses ranging from 10^-16 solar masses (M_sun) to 10 M_sun, we can estimate the frequency range by considering the minimum and maximum total mass of the binary systems:\n\n- Minimum total mass: 2 * 10^-16 M_sun\n- Maximum total mass: 2 * 10 M_sun\n\nWe also need to consider the minimum and maximum orbital separation. The minimum separation is determined by the Schwarzschild radius (R_s) of the PBHs, which is given by:\n\nR_s = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum separation is more uncertain, but we can assume that the PBHs are close enough to merge within the age of the universe (t_age ~ 13.8 billion years).\n\nBy plugging in the minimum and maximum total mass and the corresponding separations, we can estimate the frequency range of the GWs emitted by the PBHs.\n\n2. Amplitude:\n\nThe amplitude of the GWs depends on the distance to the source, the masses of the PBHs, and the orbital separation. The characteristic strain (h_c) of the GWs can be estimated as:\n\nh_c = (G * M * f_orb)^(2/3) / (c^2 * d)\n\nwhere d is the distance to the source.\n\nFor a fixed event rate, the amplitude of the GWs will depend on the distribution of the PBHs in the universe. However, we can estimate the amplitude by considering the minimum and maximum total mass and the corresponding separations, as well as the distance to the source.\n\nIn summary, to estimate the expected frequency range and amplitude of gravitational waves from a population of primordial black holes with masses ranging from 10^-16 solar masses to 10 solar masses, we need to consider the minimum and maximum total mass, the corresponding orbital separations, and the distance to the source. The actual values will depend on the distribution of the PBHs and the sensitivity of the detectors."
