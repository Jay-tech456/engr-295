    "message_2": "Topological insulators are a unique class of materials that exhibit insulating behavior in their bulk but have conducting states on their surfaces or edges. These materials have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. The topological structure of these materials provides inherent protection to quantum bits (qubits) when performing quantum operations, which is crucial for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n\nThe protection of qubits in topological insulators arises from their topological properties, which are global features of the material that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. In other words, the topological properties are robust against local perturbations, such as impurities or defects, that could otherwise cause errors in quantum operations.\n\nOne of the key features of topological insulators is the presence of topologically protected edge states or surface states. These states are characterized by a non-trivial topological invariant, which ensures their robustness against local perturbations. The edge states in a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator or the surface states in a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator are protected by a topological gap, which separates them from the bulk states. This gap prevents the scattering of electrons between the edge or surface states and the bulk states, making the conducting states immune to backscattering and localization.\n\nIn the context of quantum computing, the topological protection of qubits can be realized using Majorana fermions, which are exotic particles that are their own antiparticles. Majorana fermions can emerge as zero-energy bound states at the ends of a one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductor, which can be engineered by coupling a 1D semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling to a superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field. The non-local nature of Majorana fermions ensures that the quantum information stored in them is immune to local perturbations, making them ideal candidates for fault-tolerant qubits.\n\nA relevant example of a topological insulator-based qubit is the so-called \"Majorana qubit.\" In this case, a pair of spatially separated Majorana fermions can be used to encode a qubit, with the quantum information stored non-locally in the combined state of the two Majorana fermions. Since the quantum information is not stored in a single location, it is less susceptible to local errors, providing a natural protection against decoherence and other sources of noise.\n\nIn summary, the topological structure of topological insulators provides protection to quantum bits during quantum operations due to the inherent robustness of their topological properties against local perturbations. The presence of topologically protected edge or surface states and the non-local nature of Majorana fermions make them promising candidates for fault-tolerant qubits in quantum computing applications."
