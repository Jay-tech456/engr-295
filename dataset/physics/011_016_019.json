    "message_2": "To find the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the material, we can use the formula:\n\nχ = M / H\n\nwhere M is the magnetization of the material and H is the applied magnetic field strength.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnetization (M) of the material. Magnetization can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM = (n * μ) / V\n\nwhere n is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, μ is the magnetic moment, and V is the volume.\n\nWe are given the magnetic moment (μ) as 2.5 × 10^-23 Am^2 and the density (ρ) as 7.8 g/cm^3. We can use the density to find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (n).\n\nρ = m / V\n\nwhere m is the mass of the material and V is the volume. Since we are interested in the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (n), we can rearrange the formula to:\n\nn = ρ / μ\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nn = (7.8 g/cm^3) / (2.5 × 10^-23 Am^2)\n\nn ≈ 3.12 × 10^22 moments/cm^3\n\nNext, we need to convert the applied magnetic field strength (H) from Gauss to A/m. 1 Gauss is equal to 100 A/m.\n\nH = 5000 Gauss * (100 A/m / 1 Gauss) = 500,000 A/m\n\nNow we can find the magnetization (M) using the formula:\n\nM = (n * μ) / V\n\nSince we are looking for M per unit volume, we can simplify the formula to:\n\nM = n * μ\n\nM = (3.12 × 10^22 moments/cm^3) * (2.5 × 10^-23 Am^2)\n\nM ≈ 780 A/m\n\nFinally, we can find the magnetic susceptibility (χ) using the formula:\n\nχ = M / H\n\nχ = (780 A/m) / (500,000 A/m)\n\nχ ≈ 1.56 × 10^-3\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the material at a temperature of 20°C and an applied field strength of 5000 Gauss is approximately 1.56 × 10^-3."
