    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The electric field outside the event horizon of such a black hole can be derived from the electrostatic potential. The electric field E is given by the gradient of the electrostatic potential Φ:\n\nE = -∇Φ\n\nFor a Reissner-Nordström black hole, the electrostatic potential Φ is given by:\n\nΦ = Q / (4πε₀r)\n\nwhere Q is the charge of the black hole, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the radial coordinate (distance from the black hole).\n\nTaking the gradient of the electrostatic potential, we find the electric field:\n\nE = Q / (4πε₀r²) * (d/dr)\n\nThe electric field is radially outward and has a magnitude:\n\n|E| = Q / (4πε₀r²)\n\nAs we can see, the electric field depends on the magnitude of the charge Q and the distance r from the black hole. The electric field is stronger for larger charges and weaker for smaller charges. Additionally, the electric field decreases with the square of the distance from the black hole, following an inverse-square law.\n\nIn summary, the electric field outside the event horizon of a charged black hole described by the Reissner-Nordström metric is given by:\n\n|E| = Q / (4πε₀r²)\n\nThe electric field is stronger for larger charges and weaker for smaller charges, and it decreases with the square of the distance from the black hole."
