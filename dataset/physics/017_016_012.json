    "message_2": "When DNA molecules are subjected to external forces such as stretching or twisting, their mechanical properties change in various ways. These changes can affect the stability, structure, and function of the DNA molecule. Some of the key mechanical properties that are affected include:\n\n1. Extension and elasticity: When DNA is subjected to stretching forces, it can extend and elongate. The degree of extension depends on the force applied and the elasticity of the DNA molecule. DNA behaves as a semi-flexible polymer, and its elasticity can be described by the worm-like chain (WLC) model. At low forces, DNA behaves as an entropic spring, where the extension is mainly due to the straightening of the molecule. At higher forces, the DNA molecule transitions to a more elastic regime, where the extension is due to the deformation of the helical structure.\n\n2. Overstretching transition: When DNA is subjected to high stretching forces (around 65 pN), it undergoes an overstretching transition, where the molecule elongates by about 1.7 times its contour length. This transition is associated with structural changes in the DNA, such as the melting of the base pairs or the formation of alternative DNA structures like S-DNA.\n\n3. Supercoiling and torsional stress: When DNA is subjected to twisting forces, it can become overwound (positively supercoiled) or underwound (negatively supercoiled). This torsional stress can lead to changes in the DNA structure, such as the formation of plectonemes or the unwinding of the double helix. The degree of supercoiling depends on the applied torque and the torsional stiffness of the DNA molecule.\n\n4. DNA melting and denaturation: High stretching or twisting forces can destabilize the DNA double helix and cause the base pairs to separate, leading to DNA melting or denaturation. This process can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the force applied and the environmental conditions.\n\n5. DNA-protein interactions: External forces on DNA can also affect its interactions with proteins, such as transcription factors, nucleosomes, and polymerases. For example, stretching forces can facilitate the binding of some proteins to DNA, while torsional stress can modulate the activity of enzymes involved in DNA replication and transcription.\n\nIn summary, the mechanical properties of DNA molecules are significantly affected by external forces such as stretching and twisting. These changes can impact the stability, structure, and function of the DNA, as well as its interactions with proteins. Understanding these mechanical properties is crucial for studying the physical basis of DNA function and developing new biotechnological applications."
