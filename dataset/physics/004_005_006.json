    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational field surrounding a spherical object using the Einstein field equations, we need to consider the Schwarzschild solution, which describes the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. The Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r) dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates (time and spherical spatial coordinates).\n\nGiven the mass M = 10^26 kg and radius R = 1000 km = 10^6 m, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius (also known as the gravitational radius or event horizon for a black hole), which is given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c²\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 10²⁶ kg) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nRs ≈ 1.485 × 10³ m\n\nSince the Schwarzschild radius is smaller than the object's radius (Rs < R), the object is not a black hole, and we can use the Schwarzschild metric to describe the spacetime geometry outside the object.\n\nNow, to find the gravitational field surrounding the object, we can calculate the effective gravitational acceleration at a distance r from the center of the object. This can be derived from the Schwarzschild metric by considering the radial geodesic equation for a test particle in free fall:\n\ng(r) = GM/r² * (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹/²\n\nPlugging in the values for G, M, and c, we get:\n\ng(r) = (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 10²⁶ kg) / r² * (1 - (2 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 10²⁶ kg) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)²r)⁻¹/²\n\nThis equation gives the effective gravitational acceleration at any distance r from the center of the spherical object. Note that as r approaches infinity, the term (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹/² approaches 1, and the equation reduces to the familiar Newtonian expression for gravitational acceleration:\n\ng(r) ≈ GM/r²"
