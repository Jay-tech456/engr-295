    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop carrying a current, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of the medium (air in this case), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 3 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converting to meters)\nμ₀ = 4π x 10^-7 Tm/A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12π x 10^-7 Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 120π x 10^-7 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at the center of the circular loop is approximately 120π x 10^-7 T."
