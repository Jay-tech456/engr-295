    "message_2": "Spherical aberration is an optical effect that occurs in lenses when light rays passing through different parts of the lens focus at different points along the optical axis. It is caused by the lens shape, which is not ideal for focusing light perfectly. To determine the amount of spherical aberration, we need to know more about the lens, such as its aperture, refractive index, and shape.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze the image formation in this case. Using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length (20 cm), u is the object distance (10 cm), and v is the image distance.\n\n1/20 = 1/10 + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1/v = 1/20 - 1/10 = -1/20\n\nv = -20 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image. The image distance is 20 cm from the lens.\n\nHowever, without more information about the lens, we cannot determine the exact amount of spherical aberration produced by the lens."
