    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space that travel at nearly the speed of light. They constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere, interacting with the atoms and molecules present there. The energy of cosmic rays varies over a wide range, from about 10^6 electron volts (eV) to an extreme of 10^20 eV or more.\n\nThe composition of cosmic rays is primarily protons (about 90%), followed by helium nuclei or alpha particles (about 9%), and a small fraction of heavier nuclei (about 1%). There are also trace amounts of electrons and positrons. The origin of cosmic rays is still a subject of research, but they are believed to be produced by various astrophysical processes, such as supernova explosions, active galactic nuclei, and other high-energy events in the universe.\n\nWhen cosmic rays enter the Earth's atmosphere, they collide with the atoms and molecules present, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. These collisions lead to the production of secondary particles through a process called spallation. The initial cosmic ray particle, usually a proton or a nucleus, interacts with an atmospheric nucleus, creating a cascade of lighter particles, such as pions, kaons, and other mesons.\n\nThese secondary particles can further decay or interact with other atmospheric particles, producing even more particles, such as muons, neutrinos, and various other subatomic particles. This process creates a particle shower, also known as an air shower, which can extend several kilometers in the atmosphere.\n\nThe energy of the secondary particles depends on the energy of the primary cosmic ray and the specific interactions that occur during the cascade. Some of these secondary particles, such as muons and neutrinos, can reach the Earth's surface, while others are absorbed or decay in the atmosphere.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays that hit the Earth's atmosphere have a wide range of energies and are primarily composed of protons, helium nuclei, and a small fraction of heavier nuclei. They interact with the atmosphere, producing secondary particles through spallation and decay processes, which can create extensive air showers. The energy and composition of these secondary particles depend on the specific interactions and decays that occur during the cascade."
