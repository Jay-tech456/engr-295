    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the cross-section for electron-positron annihilation to muon-antimuon pairs at leading order in perturbation theory can be calculated using the Feynman diagrams and the Mandelstam variables. The leading-order process is represented by the t-channel exchange of a virtual photon.\n\nThe cross-section formula for this process is given by:\n\nσ = (4πα^2)/(3s) * β * (1 + (2m_e^2/s) + (2m_μ^2/s) - (4m_e^2m_μ^2/s^2))\n\nwhere:\n- α is the fine-structure constant, approximately equal to 1/137\n- s is the square of the center-of-mass energy\n- m_e is the mass of the electron\n- m_μ is the mass of the muon\n- β is the velocity of the produced muon in the center-of-mass frame, given by:\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (4m_μ^2/s))\n\nTo find the cross-section, you would need to know the center-of-mass energy (s) for the specific process. Then, you can plug in the values for α, m_e, and m_μ, and calculate the cross-section using the formula above."
