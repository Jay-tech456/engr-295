    "message_1": "A polarized filter is used to allow only vertical polarization of light to pass through it. A second polarized filter is placed at a 90° angle to the first filter. If the intensity of light passing through the first filter is I₀, what is the intensity of light that passes through both filters according to Malus' Law?",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through two polarized filters is given by the equation:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²θ\n\nwhere I is the intensity of light after passing through both filters, I₀ is the initial intensity of light, and θ is the angle between the polarization axes of the two filters.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the two filters is 90°. Therefore, θ = 90°.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(90°)\n\nSince cos(90°) = 0, the equation becomes:\n\nI = I₀ * 0²\n\nI = 0\n\nSo, the intensity of light that passes through both filters is 0. This means that no light passes through the second filter when it is placed at a 90° angle to the first filter."
