    "message_2": "The equation for calculating the event horizon radius of a black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, is not derived from the theory of Special Relativity but from the theory of General Relativity. The equation is:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light."
