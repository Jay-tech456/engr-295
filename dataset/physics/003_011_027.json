    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 2 cm away from the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the current is distributed over the entire disc, we need to integrate the magnetic field contribution from each infinitesimal current element on the disc.\n\nLet's consider a small current-carrying ring of radius r and thickness dr within the disc. The area of this ring is dA = 2πr dr, and the current density J is given by the total current (I) divided by the total area of the disc (πR^2), where R is the radius of the disc (5 cm).\n\nJ = I / (πR^2) = 2 A / (π(5 cm)^2) = 2 A / (25π cm^2)\n\nThe current in the small ring dI is given by:\n\ndI = J dA = (2 A / (25π cm^2)) * (2πr dr)\n\ndI = (4r dr) / (25 cm)\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field dB due to this small current element at a point 2 cm away from the center of the disc. The Biot-Savart Law states:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl) / r^2\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), dl is the length of the current element, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nFor a small ring, dl = 2πr, and the distance from the ring to the point 2 cm away from the center is given by:\n\nr' = sqrt((2 cm)^2 + r^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πr) / r'^2\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire disc (from r = 0 to r = R) will give us the total magnetic field at the point 2 cm away from the center:\n\nB = ∫(0 to 5 cm) (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πr) / r'^2 dr\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(0 to 5 cm) (4r dr) / (25 cm * r'^2) dr\n\nB = (μ₀ / 100π) * ∫(0 to 5 cm) (r dr) / r'^2 dr\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet x = r^2, then dx = 2r dr\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 200π) * ∫(0 to 25 cm^2) (dx) / (x + 4 cm^2)\n\nThis is a standard integral of the form ∫(dx) / (x^2 + a^2), which can be solved as:\n\n∫(dx) / (x^2 + a^2) = (1/a) * arctan(x/a)\n\nSo, the magnetic field B is:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 200π) * (1/4 cm) * [arctan(25 cm^2 / 4 cm^2) - arctan(0)]\n\nB = (μ₀ / 800π) * arctan(6.25)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of μ₀:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A) / 800π * arctan(6.25)\n\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10^-7 T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the disc and follows the right-hand rule for the direction of the current. Since the current is flowing clockwise when viewed from above, the magnetic field at the point 2 cm away from the center will be pointing downwards."
