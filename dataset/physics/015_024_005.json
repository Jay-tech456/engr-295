    "message_2": "To calculate the expected wave frequency and amplitude for the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Wave frequency (f): The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. For a binary system with masses M1 and M2, the orbital frequency (f_orbital) can be calculated using Kepler's third law:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * (G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, and a is the semi-major axis of the binary system. The gravitational wave frequency (f) is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf = 2 * f_orbital\n\n2. Wave amplitude (h): The amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the black holes, the distance from the observer to the system (D), and the orientation of the binary system. The characteristic strain (h_c) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nh_c = (4 * G^(5/3) / c^4) * (M1 * M2 * (M1 + M2)^(1/3) / D) * (pi * f)^(2/3)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light. The amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) can be estimated as:\n\nh = h_c / sqrt(f)\n\nGiven the masses of the black holes (M1 and M2) and the distance from the observer to the system (D), you can calculate the expected wave frequency (f) and amplitude (h) for the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system using these formulas. Note that these are rough estimates, and more accurate calculations would require additional information about the system, such as its eccentricity and orientation."
