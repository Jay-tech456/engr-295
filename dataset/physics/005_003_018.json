Another spaceship B is moving away from Earth in the opposite direction at a speed of 0.6c relative to Earth. What is the relative velocity of spaceship A as observed by spaceship B? (Assume that the speed of light is c=3.00x10^8 m/s)",
    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity of spaceship A as observed by spaceship B, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v_A + v_B) / (1 + (v_A * v_B) / c^2)\n\nwhere v_rel is the relative velocity of spaceship A as observed by spaceship B, v_A is the velocity of spaceship A relative to Earth, and v_B is the velocity of spaceship B relative to Earth.\n\nIn this case, v_A = 0.8c and v_B = -0.6c (negative because it's moving in the opposite direction).\n\nv_rel = (0.8c - 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * -0.6c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / (1 - 0.48)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / 0.52\n\nv_rel â‰ˆ 0.385c\n\nSo the relative velocity of spaceship A as observed by spaceship B is approximately 0.385c, or 1.155x10^8 m/s."
