    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.67 kJ/mol, which is equal to 40,670 J/mol. We need to find the vapor pressure of water at 50°C (323.15 K). We can use the known vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) as a reference point. The vapor pressure of water at 100°C is 101.3 kPa.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40,670/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nLet's solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40,670/8.314 * (-0.000671)\nln(P2/101.3) ≈ 3.25\nP2/101.3 = e^3.25\nP2 ≈ 101.3 * e^3.25\nP2 ≈ 101.3 * 25.8\nP2 ≈ 2617.74 Pa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 2617.74 Pa."
