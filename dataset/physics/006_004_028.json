    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting or shifting of atomic energy levels and their corresponding spectral lines due to the presence of an external electric field. This effect is named after Johannes Stark, who first observed it in 1913. The Stark effect can be understood using quantum mechanics and perturbation theory, which allows us to analyze how the atomic energy levels change with varying external electric fields.\n\nThere are two types of Stark effect: linear Stark effect and quadratic Stark effect.\n\n1. Linear Stark effect: This occurs when the external electric field is weak, and the energy level shifts are directly proportional to the strength of the electric field. In this case, the energy level shift ΔE is given by:\n\nΔE = μ * E\n\nwhere μ is the electric dipole moment of the atom, and E is the strength of the external electric field. The linear Stark effect is usually observed in atoms or molecules with a non-zero electric dipole moment, such as hydrogen or some other asymmetric molecules.\n\n2. Quadratic Stark effect: This occurs when the external electric field is strong, and the energy level shifts are proportional to the square of the electric field strength. In this case, the energy level shift ΔE is given by:\n\nΔE = (1/2) * α * E^2\n\nwhere α is the polarizability of the atom, and E is the strength of the external electric field. The quadratic Stark effect is observed in atoms or molecules with a zero electric dipole moment, such as noble gases or symmetric molecules.\n\nIn summary, the Stark effect in atomic spectra varies with changing external electric fields in the following ways:\n\n- For weak electric fields, the energy level shifts are directly proportional to the electric field strength, resulting in the linear Stark effect.\n- For strong electric fields, the energy level shifts are proportional to the square of the electric field strength, resulting in the quadratic Stark effect.\n- The magnitude and direction of the energy level shifts depend on the electric dipole moment and polarizability of the atom or molecule, as well as the strength and orientation of the external electric field."
