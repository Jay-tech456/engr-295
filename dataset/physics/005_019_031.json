    "message_1": "A proton with a kinetic energy of 2 GeV collides head-on with an antiproton with the same kinetic energy. If the rest mass of a proton is 938 MeV/c² and that of an antiproton is also 938 MeV/c², what is the total energy of the system and what is the wavelength of the resulting interfering waves?",
    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the system, we need to consider both the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton. The rest mass energy of each particle can be calculated using the formula E = mc², where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's convert the rest mass of the proton and antiproton from MeV/c² to GeV/c²:\n\n938 MeV/c² * (1 GeV / 1000 MeV) = 0.938 GeV/c²\n\nNow, let's find the total energy of the proton and antiproton:\n\nTotal energy of proton = Kinetic energy + Rest mass energy\nTotal energy of proton = 2 GeV + 0.938 GeV/c² = 2.938 GeV\n\nSince the antiproton has the same kinetic energy and rest mass energy, its total energy is also 2.938 GeV.\n\nNow, let's find the total energy of the system:\n\nTotal energy of the system = Total energy of proton + Total energy of antiproton\nTotal energy of the system = 2.938 GeV + 2.938 GeV = 5.876 GeV\n\nTo find the wavelength of the resulting interfering waves, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant, and p is the momentum of the particles.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total energy of the system from GeV to Joules:\n\n5.876 GeV * (1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁰ J / 1 GeV) = 9.414 × 10⁻¹⁰ J\n\nNow, let's find the momentum of the particles using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the proton and antiproton, we have:\n\n(9.414 × 10⁻¹⁰ J)² = ((0.938 GeV/c² * 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/GeV)² + (p * 3 × 10⁸ m/s)²\n\nSolving for p, we get:\n\np = 3.096 × 10⁻¹⁹ kg m/s\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength using the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\nλ = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js) / (3.096 × 10⁻¹⁹ kg m/s)\nλ = 2.14 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is 5.876 GeV, and the wavelength of the resulting interfering waves is 2.14 × 10⁻¹⁵ m."
