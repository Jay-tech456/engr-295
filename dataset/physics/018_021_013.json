    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, lepton flavor conservation is a fundamental principle. This means that the total lepton number for each lepton family (electron, muon, and tau) is conserved in any interaction. \n\nWhen a Higgs boson decays, it must conserve lepton flavor. Therefore, it cannot decay into a tau lepton and a muon simultaneously, as this would violate lepton flavor conservation. Consequently, the probability of a Higgs boson decaying into a tau lepton and a muon within the framework of the Standard Model is zero."
