If the source is moved to a distance of 2 meters from the same radiation detection instrument, how many counts will it register in 1 minute? (Assuming the activity of the source remains the same.)",
    "message_2": "We can use the inverse square law to determine the counts at the new distance. The inverse square law states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. \n\nLet I1 be the initial intensity at 1 meter, and I2 be the intensity at 2 meters. Let C1 be the initial counts (2800 counts in 15 seconds), and C2 be the counts at the new distance in 1 minute (60 seconds). \n\nAccording to the inverse square law:\n\nI1 / I2 = (D2 / D1)^2\n\nWhere D1 is the initial distance (1 meter) and D2 is the new distance (2 meters). \n\nSince the counts are proportional to the intensity, we can write:\n\nC1 / C2 = (D2 / D1)^2\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\n2800 / C2 = (2 / 1)^2\n\n2800 / C2 = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for C2:\n\nC2 = 2800 / 4\nC2 = 700 counts\n\nThis is the number of counts in 15 seconds at the new distance. To find the number of counts in 1 minute (60 seconds), we can use the proportion:\n\n700 counts / 15 seconds = x counts / 60 seconds\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (700 counts * 60 seconds) / 15 seconds\nx = 42000 / 15\nx = 2800 counts\n\nSo, the radiation detection instrument will register 2800 counts in 1 minute when the source is moved to a distance of 2 meters."
