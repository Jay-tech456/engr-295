    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a point 5 cm away from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field strength (B) around a long straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A\n- I is the current flowing through the wire, which is 3 A\n- r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to determine the magnetic field strength, which is 5 cm or 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = 1.2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point 5 cm away from the wire is 1.2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
