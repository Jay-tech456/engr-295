    "message_2": "The relationship between the number and energy of cosmic rays that enter the Earth's atmosphere and the level of ionization produced in the atmosphere can be described as follows:\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. When these particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they collide with the atoms and molecules present in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen. These collisions result in the production of secondary particles, including neutrons, mesons, and other subatomic particles. This process is known as a cosmic ray shower.\n\nThe level of ionization produced in the atmosphere is directly related to the number and energy of cosmic rays entering the atmosphere. A higher number of cosmic rays or higher energy cosmic rays will result in a higher level of ionization. Ionization occurs when the cosmic rays or secondary particles produced in the cosmic ray shower have enough energy to remove electrons from the atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, creating ions.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the number and energy of cosmic rays and the level of ionization produced in the atmosphere is a direct one: an increase in the number or energy of cosmic rays will lead to an increase in the level of ionization in the atmosphere. This ionization can have various effects on the Earth's atmosphere, including the production of ozone, the formation of clouds, and the modulation of the Earth's magnetic field."
