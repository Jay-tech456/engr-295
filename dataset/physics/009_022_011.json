    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that the angle of incidence at which the reflected light becomes completely polarized is the angle for which the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other. This angle is called the Brewster angle (θ_B). According to Brewster's Law, the tangent of the Brewster angle is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\n\ntan(θ_B) = n2 / n1\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of air (which is approximately 1) and n2 is the refractive index of the glass (1.5).\n\ntan(θ_B) = 1.5 / 1 = 1.5\n\nTo find the Brewster angle, we need to take the arctangent of 1.5:\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ_B ≈ 56.31°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence at which the reflected light from the glass surface becomes completely polarized is approximately 56.31°."
