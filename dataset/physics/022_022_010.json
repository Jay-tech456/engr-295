    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It is invisible to electromagnetic radiation, which makes it extremely difficult to detect and study. The nature and properties of dark matter are still largely unknown, and several theoretical models have been proposed to explain its behavior and interactions.\n\nOne of these models is the idea of dark atoms or dark molecules, which are hypothetical particles that could make up dark matter. These particles are thought to interact with each other through a \"dark force\" that is analogous to the electromagnetic force that holds ordinary atoms and molecules together.\n\nThe stability of dark atoms or dark molecules in a dark matter halo would depend on the balance between the attractive dark force and the thermal motion of the particles. The temperature range for stability would be determined by the strength of the dark force and the mass of the dark particles.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of experimental data and the speculative nature of dark matter theories, it is currently impossible to provide a specific temperature range for the stability of dark atoms or dark molecules in a dark matter halo. Further research and experimental observations are needed to constrain the properties of dark matter and refine the theoretical models."
