    "message_2": "To calculate the angular momentum of a rotating black hole using the Kerr metric, we can use the following formula:\n\nJ = a * M^2\n\nwhere J is the angular momentum, a is the spin parameter, and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 5 times the mass of the sun, and the spin parameter is 0.7, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nM = 5 * M_sun\na = 0.7\n\nJ = a * M^2\nJ = 0.7 * (5 * M_sun)^2\n\nNow, we need to convert the mass of the sun to the appropriate units. Since we are assuming c = G = 1, we can use the following conversion:\n\nM_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 1.48 x 10^-3 (in units where c = G = 1)\n\nNow, we can plug this value into our formula:\n\nJ = 0.7 * (5 * 1.48 x 10^-3)^2\nJ ≈ 0.7 * (7.4 x 10^-3)^2\nJ ≈ 0.7 * 5.476 x 10^-5\nJ ≈ 3.8332 x 10^-5\n\nSo, the angular momentum of the rotating black hole is approximately 3.8332 x 10^-5 (in units where c = G = 1)."
