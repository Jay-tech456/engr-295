    "message_2": "To calculate the boiling point of water at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we need to know the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) and the vapor pressure at the desired pressure (1 bar). The boiling point of water at 1 atm is 100°C or 373.15 K.\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the specific enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the specific gas constant.\n\nWe are given:\nΔHvap = 40.67 kJ/mol = 40,670 J/mol\nR = 8.31 J/mol*K\nP1 = 1 atm = 1.01325 bar\nP2 = 1 bar\nT1 = 373.15 K\n\nWe want to find T2, the boiling point at 1 bar.\n\nRearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/T1 - (R/ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 - (8.31/40,670) * ln(1/1.01325)\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002679 - 0.000204\n\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002475\n\nT2 ≈ 1/0.002475 ≈ 404.04 K\n\nSo, the boiling point of water at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar is approximately 404.04 K or 130.89°C."
