    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a helical loop, we first need to determine the magnetic field due to a single circular loop and then account for the number of turns and the helical structure.\n\nFor a single circular loop carrying a current I and having a radius R, the magnetic field B at a point P on its axis at a distance x from the center of the loop is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nNow, let's consider the helical structure. The pitch p is the distance between two consecutive turns along the axis of the helix. The angle θ between the axis of the helix and the normal to the plane of the loop can be related to the pitch and radius of the helix using the formula:\n\ntan(θ) = p / (2πR)\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field due to the helix. Since the helix has N turns, we need to sum the magnetic field contributions from each turn. We can do this by integrating the magnetic field formula over the length of the helix. Let's denote the distance from the point P to the ith turn along the axis as x_i. Then, the total magnetic field B_total is given by:\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I * R²) / 2 * Σ[1 / (R² + x_i²)^(3/2)], for i = 1 to N\n\nTo account for the helical structure, we need to adjust the distance x_i for each turn. Since the helix has a pitch p, the distance between consecutive turns along the axis is p/N. Therefore, x_i = x + (i - 1) * (p/N).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the total magnetic field formula as:\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I * R²) / 2 * Σ[1 / (R² + (x + (i - 1) * (p/N))²)^(3/2)], for i = 1 to N\n\nThis formula gives the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a helical loop with N turns, radius R, pitch p, and angle θ between the axis of the helix and the normal to the plane of the loop, carrying a current I."
