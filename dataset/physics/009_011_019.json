    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nFor a convex lens, both surfaces are curved outwards, so R1 is positive and R2 is negative. Since the lens has a radius of curvature of 15 cm, we have R1 = 15 cm and R2 = -15 cm. The index of refraction is given as n = 1.5.\n\nPlugging these values into the Lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/15 - 1/-15)\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/15 + 1/15)\n1/f = 0.5 * (2/15)\n1/f = 1/15\n\nTherefore, the focal length f is:\n\nf = 15 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the lens is 15 cm."
