    "message_1": "A convex lens with a focal length of 10 cm is placed 20 cm away from an object. What is the magnification of the image produced by the lens?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image produced by the lens, we first need to determine the image distance using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm\nu = 20 cm\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/20\n1/v = (2 - 1)/20\n1/v = 1/20\n\nSo, v = 20 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification using the formula:\n\nmagnification = image distance / object distance\n\nmagnification = v / u\nmagnification = 20 cm / 20 cm\n\nThe magnification of the image produced by the lens is 1. This means the image is the same size as the object."
