    "message_2": "To calculate the work done on the gas during this isochoric (constant pressure) process, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P is the constant pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nFirst, let's find the change in volume:\n\nΔV = V_final - V_initial\nΔV = 2.0 L - 6.0 L\nΔV = -4.0 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\nW = -(2.5 atm) * (-4.0 L)\n\nW = 10.0 L*atm\n\nTo convert the work done from L*atm to Joules, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 L*atm = 101.325 J\n\nW = 10.0 L*atm * (101.325 J / 1 L*atm)\nW = 1013.25 J\n\nSo, the work done on the gas during this process is approximately 1013.25 Joules."
