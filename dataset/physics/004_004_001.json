    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the geodesic equation of general relativity, which describes the motion of a particle in a curved spacetime. For a circular orbit in the Schwarzschild metric, the geodesic equation can be simplified to:\n\n(1) Φ' = √(GM/(r^3))\n\nwhere Φ' is the angular velocity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n- Radius of the planet: 10,000 km = 1 x 10^7 m\n- Mass of the planet: 6 x 10^24 kg\n- Radius of the orbit: 20,000 km = 2 x 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into equation (1) to find the angular velocity:\n\nΦ' = √((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (6 x 10^24 kg) / ((2 x 10^7 m)^3))\nΦ' ≈ 1.207 x 10^-4 s^-1\n\nThe angular velocity of the satellite's orbit is approximately 1.207 x 10^-4 s^-1.\n\nTo find the period of the satellite's orbit, we can use the following equation:\n\n(2) T = 2π / Φ'\n\nPlugging in the angular velocity we found:\n\nT = 2π / (1.207 x 10^-4 s^-1)\nT ≈ 52064 s\n\nThe period of the satellite's orbit is approximately 52064 seconds, or about 14.46 hours."
