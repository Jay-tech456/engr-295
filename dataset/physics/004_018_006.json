    "message_2": "Gravitational redshift, also known as gravitational redshifting or gravitational shift, is a phenomenon that occurs when light or other electromagnetic radiation travels away from a massive celestial body, such as a star or a planet. Due to the influence of gravity, the wavelength of the light becomes longer (shifted towards the red end of the spectrum), and its frequency becomes lower. This effect is a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity, which describes how gravity affects the spacetime fabric.\n\nThe impact of gravitational redshift on the wavelength of light emitted from an object at different distances from a massive celestial body can be described using the following equation:\n\nΔλ/λ = GM/c²R\n\nWhere:\n- Δλ is the change in wavelength (redshift)\n- λ is the initial wavelength of the light\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\n- M is the mass of the celestial body\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\n- R is the distance from the center of the celestial body to the object emitting the light\n\nAs the distance R increases, the gravitational redshift effect becomes less pronounced, meaning that the change in wavelength (Δλ) decreases. Conversely, as the distance R decreases, the gravitational redshift effect becomes more pronounced, and the change in wavelength (Δλ) increases.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational redshift effect causes the wavelength of light emitted from an object to increase as it moves away from a massive celestial body. The magnitude of this effect depends on the mass of the celestial body and the distance between the object and the celestial body. As the distance increases, the gravitational redshift effect becomes less significant, and the change in wavelength decreases."
