    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we need to consider the change in temperature and the heat capacity of the enzyme. The initial temperature (T1) is 25°C, and the final temperature (T2) is 35°C. The heat capacity (Cp) of the enzyme is 30 J/°C. The reaction has a delta H (ΔHrxn) of -40 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 35°C - 25°C\nΔT = 10°C\n\nNow, let's calculate the heat absorbed or released by the enzyme (q):\n\nq = Cp × ΔT\nq = 30 J/°C × 10°C\nq = 300 J\n\nSince the heat capacity is given in J/°C, we need to convert the heat absorbed or released by the enzyme (q) to kJ:\n\nq = 300 J × (1 kJ / 1000 J)\nq = 0.3 kJ\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction:\n\nΔH = ΔHrxn + q\nΔH = -40 kJ/mol + 0.3 kJ\nΔH = -39.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is -39.7 kJ/mol."
