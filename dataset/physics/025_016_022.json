    "message_2": "The change in free energy (ΔG) for the metabolic pathway of glycolysis in human cells can be calculated by considering the overall reaction and the free energy changes associated with each step. Glycolysis is a series of 10 enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, with the net production of two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH.\n\nThe overall reaction for glycolysis is:\n\nGlucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 ATP + 2 H2O\n\nThe standard free energy change (ΔG°') for the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi is +7.3 kcal/mol (or +30.5 kJ/mol). However, the actual free energy change (ΔG) under cellular conditions is more negative, around -7.3 kcal/mol (or -30.5 kJ/mol) due to the high ratio of ADP to ATP in the cell.\n\nSince glycolysis produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, the net free energy change associated with ATP production is:\n\nΔG_ATP = 2 × (-7.3 kcal/mol) = -14.6 kcal/mol (or -61 kJ/mol)\n\nThe free energy change associated with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH is -52.6 kJ/mol. Since glycolysis produces 2 NADH molecules per glucose molecule, the net free energy change associated with NADH production is:\n\nΔG_NADH = 2 × (-52.6 kJ/mol) = -105.2 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall change in free energy (ΔG) for the metabolic pathway of glycolysis by summing the free energy changes associated with ATP and NADH production:\n\nΔG_glycolysis = ΔG_ATP + ΔG_NADH = -61 kJ/mol + (-105.2 kJ/mol) = -166.2 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the change in free energy (ΔG) for the metabolic pathway of glycolysis in human cells is approximately -166.2 kJ/mol. This negative value indicates that the glycolysis pathway is exergonic, meaning it releases energy and proceeds spontaneously under cellular conditions."
