    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula. The lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nWhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, focal length (f) = -10 cm (negative sign indicates concave lens)\nObject distance (u) = -30 cm (negative sign indicates the object is on the same side as the light source)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-10) + 1/(-30)\n1/v = (-3 + (-1))/(-30)\n1/v = -4/30\nv = -30/4\nv = -7.5 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object. So, the image is formed 7.5 cm away from the lens.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = v/u\n\nm = (-7.5)/(-30)\nm = 1/4\n\nThe magnification is 1/4, which means the image is 1/4th the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave lens is virtual, upright, and diminished in size. It is formed 7.5 cm away from the lens on the same side as the object, and the magnification produced by the lens is 1/4.\n\nNote: A ray diagram would be helpful to visualize the image formation, but it cannot be drawn in this text-based format. You can search for \"concave lens ray diagram\" online to find examples of how to draw the diagram."
