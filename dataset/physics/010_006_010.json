    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure at the bottom of the container, we can use the formula:\n\nPressure (P) = hρg\n\nwhere h is the height of the liquid column, ρ is the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the density of the oil. The specific gravity of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So, the density of the oil can be calculated as:\n\nρ = specific gravity × density of water\nρ = 0.8 × 1000 kg/m³\nρ = 800 kg/m³\n\nNext, we need to convert the height of the container from centimeters to meters:\n\nh = 30 cm × (1 m / 100 cm)\nh = 0.3 m\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the pressure at the bottom of the container. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately 9.81 m/s²:\n\nP = hρg\nP = (0.3 m)(800 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)\nP = 2354.4 Pa\n\nTherefore, the pressure at the bottom of the container is 2354.4 Pascals."
