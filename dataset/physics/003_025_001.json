    "message_1": "A copper wire with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 2 mm is connected to a resistor that carries a current of 3 A. Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire. Assume the wire is straight and the current flows uniformly throughout the wire.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current flowing through the wire (3 A)\n- r is the distance from the center of the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1 m\nB = 1.2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the wire is 1.2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
