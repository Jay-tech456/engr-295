    "message_2": "The solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass, such as a star or a planet, is known as the Schwarzschild solution. It was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, shortly after Einstein published his theory of general relativity. The Schwarzschild solution is given by the following metric:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r) dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates (t is time, r is the radial coordinate, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle).\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution describes the curvature of spacetime caused by a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. It predicts several phenomena, such as the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing) and the precession of planetary orbits, which have been experimentally confirmed.\n\nThe solution for a vacuum spacetime, on the other hand, is the Minkowski spacetime. It is the simplest solution to the Einstein field equations and represents the spacetime in the absence of any mass or energy. The Minkowski spacetime is flat and is described by the following metric:\n\nds² = -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²\n\nwhere (t, x, y, z) are the Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe main difference between the Schwarzschild solution and the Minkowski spacetime is the presence of mass. The Schwarzschild solution describes the spacetime outside a massive object, while the Minkowski spacetime describes a vacuum spacetime with no mass or energy. As a result, the curvature of spacetime is different in these two solutions, leading to different physical predictions."
