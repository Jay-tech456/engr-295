    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical potential difference required to open the ion channel, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the potential difference across a membrane to the concentrations of ions on either side of the membrane. The Nernst equation is given by:\n\nΔV = (RT/zF) * ln([C_out]/[C_in])\n\nwhere:\nΔV = electrical potential difference (in volts)\nR = gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\nT = temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298.15 K)\nz = valence of the ion (assuming monovalent ions, z = 1)\nF = Faraday's constant = 96,485 C/mol\n[C_out] = concentration outside the channel (100 mM = 0.1 mol/L)\n[C_in] = concentration inside the channel (10 mM = 0.01 mol/L)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔV = (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298.15 K) / (1 * 96,485 C/mol) * ln(0.1 mol/L / 0.01 mol/L)\n\nΔV = (2.478 * 10^3 J/C) * ln(10)\n\nΔV ≈ 0.05916 V\n\nSo, the electrical potential difference required to open the ion channel is approximately 0.05916 volts or 59.16 mV."
