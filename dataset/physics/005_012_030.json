    "message_2": "To find the kinetic energy of the astronaut, we will use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the astronaut, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship (99.999% the speed of light) and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = 0.99999c\n\nNow, we can calculate γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999c)^2/c^2)\nγ ≈ 223.607\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (223.607 - 1)(1000 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 6.69 x 10^19 Joules\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the 1000 kg astronaut in the spaceship is approximately 6.69 x 10^19 Joules."
