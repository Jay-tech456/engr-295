    "message_2": "To calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of gravitational waves emitted from a population of primordial black holes (PBHs), we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector: This is usually given in terms of the detector's strain sensitivity, which is a measure of the detector's ability to detect a gravitational wave signal. A lower strain sensitivity means a more sensitive detector.\n\n2. The distribution of black hole masses in the population: This can be described by a mass function, which gives the probability density of finding a PBH with a given mass. The mass function can be derived from theoretical models or observational constraints.\n\n3. The rate of gravitational wave events: This depends on the number density of PBHs and their merger rate, which can be influenced by factors such as the initial mass function, the cosmic expansion rate, and the clustering of PBHs.\n\n4. The gravitational wave signal strength: This depends on the masses of the merging PBHs and their distance from the detector. The signal strength is typically expressed in terms of the characteristic strain, which is a measure of the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal.\n\nTo calculate the expected SNR, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the characteristic strain (h_c) for each PBH merger event, taking into account the masses of the merging PBHs and their distance from the detector.\n\n2. Calculate the expected number of PBH merger events (N) within the detector's sensitive volume and observation time, using the rate of gravitational wave events and the mass function.\n\n3. Calculate the noise power spectral density (S_n) of the detector, which is a measure of the detector's noise level as a function of frequency.\n\n4. Integrate the ratio of the squared characteristic strain to the noise power spectral density over the frequency range of interest (f_min to f_max) to obtain the expected SNR:\n\nSNR = sqrt(âˆ«[h_c^2(f) / S_n(f)] df, from f_min to f_max)\n\nThe expected SNR will depend on the specific sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector and the distribution of black hole masses in the population. A higher SNR indicates a better chance of detecting gravitational waves from PBH mergers."
