    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects the patterns observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation through its influence on the distribution and evolution of matter in the early universe. The CMB radiation is the relic radiation from the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the universe when it was around 380,000 years old. At that time, the universe was filled with a hot, dense plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons (protons and neutrons). Dark matter, being non-baryonic and non-interacting with light, played a crucial role in shaping the distribution of this plasma.\n\nDark matter interacts gravitationally with the baryonic matter, causing it to clump together and form the seeds of large-scale structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters. These gravitational interactions also create fluctuations in the density and temperature of the plasma, which are imprinted in the CMB radiation as anisotropies or variations in temperature across the sky.\n\nThe study of these anisotropies allows physicists to probe the properties of dark matter and dark energy. By analyzing the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropies, which shows the distribution of temperature fluctuations at different angular scales, researchers can extract information about the composition and evolution of the universe.\n\nThe power spectrum exhibits a series of peaks, known as acoustic peaks, which correspond to the oscillations of the plasma in the early universe. The position, height, and shape of these peaks are sensitive to the amount of dark matter, baryonic matter, and dark energy in the universe, as well as other cosmological parameters.\n\nFor example, the position of the first acoustic peak is related to the curvature of the universe and the total matter content (including dark matter). The height of the peaks is influenced by the ratio of baryonic matter to dark matter, while the damping of the peaks at small angular scales is affected by the presence of dark energy, which causes the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nBy comparing the observed CMB power spectrum with theoretical predictions from different cosmological models, researchers can estimate the quantities of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. Current observations, such as those from the Planck satellite, indicate that the universe is composed of approximately 5% baryonic matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy."
