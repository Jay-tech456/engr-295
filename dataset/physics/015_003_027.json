    "message_2": "The polarization angle of gravitational waves detected by LIGO is not directly affected by the distance between the merging black holes. Instead, the polarization angle is determined by the orientation of the binary system (the two merging black holes) with respect to the detectors on Earth.\n\nGravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as merging black holes. These waves propagate outwards from the source and can be detected by observatories like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Gravitational waves have two independent polarizations, typically referred to as \"plus\" (+) and \"cross\" (x) polarizations. These polarizations describe the way spacetime is stretched and compressed as the waves pass through.\n\nThe polarization angle is the angle between the \"plus\" polarization and the plane of the sky, as seen by the detector. This angle depends on the orientation of the binary system's orbital plane and the angle between the line of sight from the detector to the source and the source's angular momentum vector.\n\nThe distance between the merging black holes affects the amplitude (or strength) of the gravitational waves detected by LIGO. As the distance between the black holes increases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases. However, this distance does not have a direct impact on the polarization angle of the detected waves.\n\nIn summary, the polarization angle of gravitational waves detected by LIGO is determined by the orientation of the merging black holes with respect to the detectors, and not by the distance between the black holes themselves."
