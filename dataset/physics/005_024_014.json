According to the spaceship's clock, how long will the journey take, and how much time will have passed on Earth when the spaceship arrives at its destination in the context of relativistic cosmology?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the time dilation effect due to special relativity. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the spaceship (proper time), Δt is the time experienced by an observer on Earth (coordinate time), v is the spaceship's velocity (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time experienced by an observer on Earth. Since the spaceship is traveling at 0.8c and the distance to the galaxy is 10 billion light-years, we can find the time it takes to travel this distance:\n\nΔt = distance / velocity = (10 billion light-years) / (0.8c) = 12.5 billion years\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula to find the time experienced by the spaceship:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2) = (12.5 billion years) / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt' = (12.5 billion years) / √(1 - 0.64) = (12.5 billion years) / √(0.36)\n\nΔt' ≈ (12.5 billion years) / 0.6 ≈ 20.83 billion years\n\nSo, according to the spaceship's clock, the journey will take approximately 20.83 billion years. However, when the spaceship arrives at its destination, 12.5 billion years will have passed on Earth."
