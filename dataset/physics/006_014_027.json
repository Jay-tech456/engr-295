    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of the excited state, we can use the Einstein A coefficient, which describes the probability of spontaneous emission of a photon during the transition from the n=3 state to the n=2 state. The formula for the Einstein A coefficient is:\n\nA_32 = (64 * π^4 * e^2 * f_32) / (3 * h * c^3)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and f_32 is the oscillator strength for the transition from n=3 to n=2.\n\nThe oscillator strength, f_32, can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf_32 = (2 * R_H * λ^2 * (n_2^2 * n_3^2)) / (3 * n_2 * (n_3^2 - n_2^2))\n\nwhere R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1), λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon (656.3 nm), and n_2 and n_3 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states (2 and 3, respectively).\n\nFirst, let's calculate f_32:\n\nf_32 = (2 * 1.097 x 10^7 * (656.3 x 10^-9)^2 * (2^2 * 3^2)) / (3 * 2 * (3^2 - 2^2))\nf_32 ≈ 0.416\n\nNow, we can calculate the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nA_32 = (64 * π^4 * (1.6 x 10^-19)^2 * 0.416) / (3 * 6.63 x 10^-34 * (3 x 10^8)^3)\nA_32 ≈ 6.265 x 10^6 s^-1\n\nThe lifetime of the excited state (τ) is the inverse of the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A_32\nτ ≈ 1 / (6.265 x 10^6)\nτ ≈ 1.596 x 10^-7 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state in a hydrogen atom when the electron is in the n=3 state and transitions back down to the n=2 state, emitting a photon with a wavelength of 656.3 nm, is approximately 1.596 x 10^-7 seconds."
