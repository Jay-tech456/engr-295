    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite the hydrogen atom from its ground state (n=1) to n=3 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level (3 in this case), and ni is the initial energy level (1 in this case).\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/3^2 - 1/1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/9 - 1) = -13.6 eV * (-8/9) = 12.1 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite the hydrogen atom from its ground state to n=3 energy level is 12.1 eV.\n\nWhen the electron falls back to its ground state, it will emit a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the two levels. We can use the Planck-Einstein relation to find the wavelength of the emitted photon:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\nE = 12.1 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.94 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.94 x 10^-18 J) = 1.02 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon emitted when the electron falls back to its ground state is 1.02 x 10^-7 m or 102 nm."
