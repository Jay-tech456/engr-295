    "message_2": "The relationship between the energy of an incident ionizing particle and the depth of maximum ionization (Bragg peak) in a material can be described as follows:\n\nAs the energy of the incident ionizing particle increases, the depth at which the maximum ionization (Bragg peak) occurs also increases. This is because higher energy particles can penetrate deeper into the material before losing their energy through interactions with the material's atoms.\n\nThe Bragg peak is a characteristic of charged particles, such as protons and alpha particles, when they travel through a material. As these particles lose energy due to ionization and excitation of the atoms in the material, their energy loss per unit path length increases. This results in a sharp peak of ionization near the end of their range, known as the Bragg peak.\n\nThe depth of the Bragg peak depends on the initial energy of the incident ionizing particle and the stopping power of the material, which is a measure of how much energy the particle loses per unit path length in the material. The stopping power depends on the material's density, atomic number, and the particle's charge and velocity.\n\nIn summary, the depth of the Bragg peak in a material is directly related to the energy of the incident ionizing particle. Higher energy particles will have a deeper Bragg peak, while lower energy particles will have a shallower Bragg peak."
