    "message_2": "Three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TIs) are a unique class of materials that exhibit insulating behavior in their bulk but have conducting surface states. These surface states are characterized by their topological properties, which make them robust against local perturbations and impurities. This robustness is a key feature that can be exploited for fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n\nTo implement fault-tolerant quantum computing using 3D TIs, one can create and manipulate anyons, which are quasiparticles that emerge in the topological surface states. Anyons have non-trivial braiding statistics, meaning that their quantum states change in a unique way when they are exchanged or braided around each other. This property can be used to perform topological quantum computation, where quantum information is stored and processed by braiding anyons.\n\nOne approach to achieve this is by inducing superconductivity in the topological surface states of 3D TIs, which can lead to the formation of Majorana fermions. Majorana fermions are special anyons that are their own antiparticles and have non-Abelian braiding statistics. This means that the outcome of braiding Majorana fermions depends on the order in which they are braided, allowing for the encoding and manipulation of quantum information.\n\nIn topological superconductors, Majorana fermions can appear as zero-energy modes at the ends of one-dimensional (1D) topological superconducting wires or at the cores of vortices in two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductors. To store and manipulate quantum information using Majorana fermions, one can perform a series of braiding operations by moving them around each other in a controlled manner. The quantum information is protected by the topological nature of the Majorana fermions, making the computation fault-tolerant against local errors and decoherence.\n\nIn summary, the topological surface states of 3D topological insulators can be used to implement fault-tolerant quantum computing by creating and manipulating anyons, such as Majorana fermions, in the induced topological superconducting phase. The braiding of Majorana fermions allows for the storage and manipulation of quantum information in a topologically protected manner, making the computation robust against local errors and decoherence."
