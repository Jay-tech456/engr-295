    "message_2": "Experiment: Snell's Law Method\n\nObjective: To determine the refractive index of the new material using Snell's Law.\n\nMaterials:\n1. A rectangular block of the new material with flat, parallel surfaces\n2. A laser pointer or a collimated light source\n3. A protractor or a goniometer\n4. A white screen or a piece of paper\n5. A ruler\n6. A pencil\n\nProcedure:\n1. Place the rectangular block of the new material on a flat surface, such as a table.\n2. Set up the laser pointer or collimated light source so that it is aimed at one of the flat surfaces of the block at an angle of incidence (θ₁) between 0° and 90°. Make sure the light source is stable and secure.\n3. Use the protractor or goniometer to measure the angle of incidence (θ₁) accurately.\n4. Place the white screen or piece of paper on the other side of the block to observe the refracted light ray.\n5. Trace the path of the incident light ray and the refracted light ray on the block's surface using the pencil.\n6. Remove the block from the table and use the protractor or goniometer to measure the angle of refraction (θ₂) accurately.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 for different angles of incidence (θ₁) to obtain multiple sets of data.\n\nData Analysis:\n1. Use Snell's Law to calculate the refractive index (n) of the new material:\n\n    n = sin(θ₁) / sin(θ₂)\n\n2. Calculate the refractive index (n) for each set of data obtained in the experiment.\n3. Calculate the average refractive index (n) from all the sets of data.\n\nResults:\nThe average refractive index (n) obtained from the experiment is the refractive index of the new material.\n\nConclusion:\nBy using Snell's Law and measuring the angles of incidence and refraction for a light ray passing through the new material, the refractive index of the material can be determined. This experiment allows the student to understand the optical properties of the new material and how it affects the propagation of light."
