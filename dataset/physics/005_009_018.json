    "message_1": "A spaceship is approaching Earth at a velocity of 0.6c. Its engines emit a sound wave of frequency 10 kHz. What would be the frequency of this sound wave heard by a stationary observer on Earth? (Assuming the speed of sound in air to be 343 m/s)",
    "message_2": "As a physicist, I must clarify that sound waves cannot travel through the vacuum of space. Sound waves require a medium, such as air or water, to propagate. In space, there is no medium for sound waves to travel through, so a stationary observer on Earth would not be able to hear the sound emitted by the spaceship's engines.\n\nHowever, if we were to consider this as an electromagnetic wave (like light) instead of a sound wave, we could use the relativistic Doppler effect to calculate the frequency observed by the stationary observer on Earth.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler effect formula is:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - β) / (1 + β))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_emitted is the emitted frequency, and β is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c).\n\nIn this case, f_emitted = 10 kHz, and β = 0.6.\n\nf_observed = 10 kHz * sqrt((1 - 0.6) / (1 + 0.6))\nf_observed = 10 kHz * sqrt(0.4 / 1.6)\nf_observed = 10 kHz * sqrt(0.25)\nf_observed = 10 kHz * 0.5\nf_observed = 5 kHz\n\nSo, if we were considering this as an electromagnetic wave, a stationary observer on Earth would observe the frequency of the wave to be 5 kHz."
