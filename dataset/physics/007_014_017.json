    "message_2": "To find the nuclear radius of a carbon-12 nucleus, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the given density of nuclear matter. \n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the carbon-12 nucleus. We can use the formula:\n\nVolume = Mass / Density\n\nVolume = (1.99 x 10^-26 kg) / (2.3 x 10^17 kg/m^3)\nVolume ≈ 8.65 x 10^-44 m^3\n\nNow that we have the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the radius:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr^3\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the radius:\n\nr = (3 * Volume / (4 * π))^(1/3)\n\nr = (3 * 8.65 x 10^-44 m^3 / (4 * π))^(1/3)\nr ≈ 1.16 x 10^-14 meters\n\nSo, the nuclear radius of a carbon-12 nucleus is approximately 1.16 x 10^-14 meters."
