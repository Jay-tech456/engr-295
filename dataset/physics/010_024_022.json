    "message_2": "The maximum size a star can attain before its gravitational force becomes strong enough to prevent the expansion of hydrogen in its core and lead to a supernova is determined by the Eddington Limit. The Eddington Limit is the point at which the outward radiation pressure balances the inward gravitational force. Stars with masses above this limit are unstable and will likely undergo a supernova. The Eddington Limit is approximately 120-150 solar masses, meaning a star with an initial mass greater than this value will likely undergo a supernova.\n\nThe initial mass of a star has a significant impact on its size, lifespan, and ultimate fate. Here's a brief overview of how the initial mass affects these factors:\n\n1. Size: Generally, the more massive a star is, the larger its size. Massive stars have stronger gravitational forces, which compress the stellar material and increase the temperature and pressure in the core. This leads to a larger and more luminous star.\n\n2. Lifespan: The lifespan of a star is primarily determined by its initial mass and the rate at which it consumes its nuclear fuel. More massive stars have shorter lifespans because they burn through their nuclear fuel more quickly. For example, a star with 10 solar masses will have a lifespan of around 20 million years, while a star with 0.1 solar masses will have a lifespan of around 10 trillion years.\n\n3. Ultimate fate: The initial mass of a star also determines its ultimate fate. Stars with initial masses less than 8 solar masses will end their lives as white dwarfs, while stars with initial masses between 8 and 20 solar masses will undergo a supernova and leave behind a neutron star. Stars with initial masses greater than 20 solar masses will also undergo a supernova, but they will leave behind a black hole.\n\nIn summary, the maximum size a star can attain before its gravitational force becomes strong enough to prevent the expansion of hydrogen in its core and lead to a supernova is around 120-150 solar masses. The initial mass of a star plays a crucial role in determining its size, lifespan, and ultimate fate."
