    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 15 cm is used to form an image of an object. The object is placed 20 cm away from the mirror. Determine the image distance, magnification, and the nature of the image formed.",
    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm\nu = -20 cm (negative sign because the object is in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\n1/15 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying through by 60v to eliminate the fractions:\n\n4v = -3v + 60\n\nAdding 3v to both sides:\n\n7v = 60\n\nDividing by 7:\n\nv = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 cm\n\nThe image distance is approximately 8.57 cm. Since the value is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M):\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -8.57/-20\n\nM ≈ 0.429\n\nThe magnification is approximately 0.429, which means the image is smaller than the object (since M < 1).\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real, inverted, and smaller image with an image distance of approximately 8.57 cm and a magnification of approximately 0.429."
