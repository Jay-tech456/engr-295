    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy of a particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven the velocity of the particle is 0.8c, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy using the equation K = (γ - 1)mc^2:\n\nK = (1.6667 - 1)(2 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nK = (0.6667)(2 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 1.2 x 10^17 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the particle is approximately 1.2 x 10^17 Joules."
