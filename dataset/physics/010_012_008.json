    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * (ν / U₀)^(1/2)) * 5\n\nwhere:\nx = distance from the leading edge of the plate (0.8 m)\nν = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (1.5 x 10^-5 m²/s)\nU₀ = free stream velocity (8 m/s)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the square root of the ratio of kinematic viscosity to the free stream velocity:\n\n(ν / U₀)^(1/2) = (1.5 x 10^-5 / 8)^(1/2) = (1.875 x 10^-6)^(1/2) ≈ 0.001369\n\nNow, we can find the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (0.8 * 0.001369) * 5 ≈ 0.00548 * 5 ≈ 0.0274 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.8 m from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.0274 m or 27.4 mm."
