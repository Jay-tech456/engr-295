    "message_1": "A concave mirror with a focal length of 10 cm has an object placed 20 cm in front of it. Determine the image distance and magnification of the resulting image.",
    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (do) is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator:\n\n2/20 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nSubtract 1/20 from both sides:\n\n1/20 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 20 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is 20 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -20/20\n\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the resulting image is -1, which means the image is inverted and has the same size as the object."
