    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000 solar masses and located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, we need to consider several factors. These factors include the sensitivity of the detectors, the rate of IMBH mergers, and the strength of the gravitational waves emitted by these mergers.\n\nCurrently, the most sensitive gravitational wave detectors are the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The sensitivity of these detectors depends on the frequency of the gravitational waves, which in turn depends on the masses of the merging black holes. For IMBHs with masses between 100 and 1000 solar masses, the emitted gravitational waves will be in the frequency range detectable by LIGO and Virgo.\n\nThe rate of IMBH mergers is still uncertain, as there have been only a few detections of gravitational waves from black holes in this mass range. However, let's assume a conservative estimate of one IMBH merger per year within the observable volume of the universe.\n\nThe strength of the gravitational waves emitted by a merger depends on the masses of the merging black holes and their distance from Earth. For IMBHs located at a distance of 1 billion light-years, the emitted gravitational waves will be weaker than those from closer events, making them more challenging to detect.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of IMBHs at 1 billion light-years from Earth will depend on the sensitivity of the detectors and the rate of IMBH mergers. With the current sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo, it is difficult to provide an exact probability, but it is likely to be low.\n\nAs for the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of such detections, this will also depend on the masses of the merging black holes and their distance from Earth. In general, the SNR decreases as the distance to the source increases. For IMBHs at 1 billion light-years, the SNR is expected to be lower than for closer events. However, the exact value of the SNR will depend on the specific parameters of the merger, such as the masses of the black holes and their orbital parameters.\n\nIn summary, the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of IMBHs at 1 billion light-years from Earth is likely to be low, given the current sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo and the uncertainty in the rate of IMBH mergers. The expected signal-to-noise ratio for such detections will also be lower than for closer events, making them more challenging to detect and analyze."
