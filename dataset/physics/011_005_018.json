    "message_2": "The temperature has a significant effect on the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy of the material also increases, causing the magnetic moments of the individual atoms to become more randomly oriented. This randomization of magnetic moments weakens the overall magnetization of the material.\n\nIn ferromagnetic materials, there is a critical temperature called the Curie temperature (Tc) at which the material loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic. At the Curie temperature, the thermal energy becomes strong enough to overcome the exchange interaction between neighboring magnetic moments, which is responsible for the alignment of these moments in ferromagnetic materials.\n\nThe Curie temperature is different for different ferromagnetic materials and depends on the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal structure of the material. For example, the Curie temperature for iron (Fe) is around 1043 K (770 °C), for nickel (Ni) it is around 627 K (354 °C), and for cobalt (Co) it is around 1394 K (1121 °C).\n\nIn summary, the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material decreases with increasing temperature, and the material loses its magnetization at the Curie temperature, becoming paramagnetic."
