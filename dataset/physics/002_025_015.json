    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of the mixture, we need to take a weighted average of the specific heat capacities of water and ethanol based on their mass fractions in the mixture. The specific heat capacity of water (c_water) is approximately 4.18 J/(g·°C) and the specific heat capacity of ethanol (c_ethanol) is approximately 2.44 J/(g·°C).\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of water and ethanol in the mixture:\n\nmass_water = 0.60 * 2000 g = 1200 g\nmass_ethanol = 0.40 * 2000 g = 800 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the weighted average of the specific heat capacities:\n\nc_mixture = (mass_water * c_water + mass_ethanol * c_ethanol) / (mass_water + mass_ethanol)\n\nc_mixture = (1200 g * 4.18 J/(g·°C) + 800 g * 2.44 J/(g·°C)) / (1200 g + 800 g)\n\nc_mixture = (5016 J/°C + 1952 J/°C) / 2000 g\n\nc_mixture = 6968 J/°C / 2000 g\n\nc_mixture ≈ 3.484 J/(g·°C)\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the 2 kg mixture made up of 60% water and 40% ethanol at a temperature of 25°C assuming constant pressure is approximately 3.484 J/(g·°C)."
