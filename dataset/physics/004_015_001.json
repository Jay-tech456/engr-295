    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters significantly affects the gravitational lensing observed in these systems. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy. This bending of light is a direct consequence of the General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\nDark matter, an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light but has mass, is believed to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe. It plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Since dark matter has mass, it contributes to the overall gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster, which in turn affects the gravitational lensing observed.\n\nAccording to the General Theory of Relativity, the presence of mass (including dark matter) warps the spacetime around it, causing light to follow curved paths as it passes through the warped spacetime. This curvature of light paths results in the observed lensing effect. The more mass present in a galaxy cluster, the stronger the lensing effect will be. Therefore, the presence of dark matter enhances the gravitational lensing observed in galaxy clusters.\n\nBy studying the gravitational lensing effects in galaxy clusters, astronomers can infer the distribution of dark matter within these systems. This is because the amount of lensing is directly related to the mass distribution in the cluster. By comparing the observed lensing with the visible mass (stars and gas), astronomers can deduce the presence and distribution of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters significantly affects the gravitational lensing observed, as it contributes to the overall mass and thus the gravitational potential of the system. The General Theory of Relativity provides the framework for understanding this phenomenon, as it describes how mass, including dark matter, warps spacetime and causes light to follow curved paths."
