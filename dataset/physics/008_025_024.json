    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is associated with the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving other particles mass. The Higgs boson has several properties, and its decay modes depend on these properties.\n\nProperties of the Higgs boson:\n\n1. Mass: The Higgs boson has a mass of approximately 125.1 GeV/c², making it one of the heaviest particles in the Standard Model.\n\n2. Spin: The Higgs boson has a spin of 0, which means it is a scalar particle. This is a unique property among the known elementary particles.\n\n3. Parity: The Higgs boson has positive parity, which means it remains unchanged under a parity transformation (reflection through the origin).\n\n4. Electric charge: The Higgs boson is electrically neutral, with a charge of 0.\n\n5. Color charge: The Higgs boson does not carry any color charge, which means it does not interact via the strong nuclear force.\n\n6. Coupling: The Higgs boson couples to other particles proportional to their mass, which means it interacts more strongly with heavier particles.\n\nDecay modes of the Higgs boson:\n\nThe Higgs boson is an unstable particle and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. The decay modes of the Higgs boson depend on its properties, particularly its mass and coupling to other particles. Some of the most common decay modes are:\n\n1. Higgs boson to bottom quarks (H → bb): This is the most probable decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks, which are the second-heaviest quarks in the Standard Model.\n\n2. Higgs boson to W bosons (H → WW): The Higgs boson can decay into a pair of W bosons, which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos or quarks. This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%.\n\n3. Higgs boson to Z bosons (H → ZZ): The Higgs boson can also decay into a pair of Z bosons, which then decay into leptons or quarks. This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%.\n\n4. Higgs boson to tau leptons (H → ττ): The Higgs boson can decay into a pair of tau leptons, which are the heaviest leptons in the Standard Model. This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%.\n\n5. Higgs boson to photons (H → γγ): Although the Higgs boson does not couple directly to photons, it can decay into a pair of photons through a loop of virtual particles, such as top quarks or W bosons. This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%.\n\nThe properties of the Higgs boson, such as its mass and coupling to other particles, determine the probabilities of these decay modes. The different decay modes are crucial for the experimental detection and study of the Higgs boson, as they produce distinct signatures in particle detectors."
