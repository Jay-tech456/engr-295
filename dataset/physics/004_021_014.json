    "message_2": "The maximum possible mass of a white dwarf star without collapsing into a neutron star is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately 1.4 solar masses (1.4 times the mass of our Sun). This limit is derived from the balance between the electron degeneracy pressure, which prevents the star from collapsing, and the gravitational force, which tries to compress the star.\n\nIf a white dwarf star has a mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit, it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure alone and will undergo further gravitational collapse. There are a few possible fates for such stars:\n\n1. If the white dwarf is part of a binary system and accretes mass from its companion star, it may reach the Chandrasekhar limit and undergo a Type Ia supernova explosion. This event completely destroys the white dwarf, leaving no remnant behind.\n\n2. If the mass of the white dwarf increases beyond the Chandrasekhar limit through other processes, such as a merger with another white dwarf, it may collapse into a neutron star. Neutron stars are supported by neutron degeneracy pressure, which is stronger than electron degeneracy pressure.\n\n3. In some cases, if the mass of the collapsing star is even greater (typically more than 3 solar masses), the neutron degeneracy pressure may not be sufficient to halt the collapse, and the star may continue to collapse into a black hole.\n\nIn summary, stars with masses greater than the Chandrasekhar limit cannot exist as stable white dwarfs and will either explode as supernovae, collapse into neutron stars, or potentially form black holes, depending on the specific circumstances and mass involved."
