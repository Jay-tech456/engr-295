    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the rod, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nSince the rod is straight, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the rod to find the total magnetic field B at the point located 5 cm away from the center of the rod.\n\nLet's set up the coordinate system such that the center of the rod is at the origin (0,0), and the point where we want to find the magnetic field is on the positive x-axis at (5,0) cm. The rod extends from -15 cm to 15 cm along the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element Idy at a distance y from the origin along the rod. The distance r from this current element to the point (5,0) is given by:\n\nr = √((5 - 0)² + (0 - y)²) = √(5² + y²)\n\nThe angle θ between the current element and the position vector r is 90 degrees, so the cross product dl x r simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dy * r\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dy * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to y from -15 cm to 15 cm:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dy * r) / r³ from -15 to 15\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dy) / (5² + y²)^(3/2) from -15 to 15\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet y = 5 * tan(u), so dy = 5 * sec²(u) du\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(5 * sec²(u) du) / (5² * (sec²(u)))^(3/2) from -arctan(3) to arctan(3)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(du) / (1 + tan²(u))^(3/2) from -arctan(3) to arctan(3)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(du) / sec³(u) from -arctan(3) to arctan(3)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that sec³(u) = sec(u) * sec²(u) and the integral of du / sec³(u) is -2 * tan(u) / sec(u) + C:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * [-2 * tan(u) / sec(u)] from -arctan(3) to arctan(3)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * [-2 * tan(arctan(3)) / sec(arctan(3)) + 2 * tan(-arctan(3)) / sec(-arctan(3))]\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * [-2 * 3 / √(1 + 3²) + 2 * (-3) / √(1 + (-3)²)]\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * [-6 / √10 + 6 / √10]\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (2.5 A) * (12 / √10)\n\nB ≈ (10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2.5 A) * (12 / √10)\n\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10⁻⁷ T * (12 / √10)\n\nB ≈ 7.5 × 10⁻⁷ T * (12 / √10)\n\nB ≈ 2.68 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the rod is approximately 2.68 × 10⁻⁶ T."
