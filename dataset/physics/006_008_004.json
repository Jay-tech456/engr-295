    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident light, and W is the work function of the metal.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the incident light. We can use the equation:\n\nc = λf\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and λ is the wavelength of the light (500 nm or 500 x 10^-9 m).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for f:\n\nf = c / λ\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (500 x 10^-9 m)\n\nf = 6 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the incident photons using the equation:\n\nE_photon = hf\n\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (6 x 10^14 Hz)\n\nE_photon = 3.9756 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo convert the work function from electron volts (eV) to joules (J), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nW = 4.5 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)\n\nW = 7.209 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons using the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W\n\nK_max = 3.9756 x 10^-19 J - 7.209 x 10^-19 J\n\nK_max = -3.2334 x 10^-19 J\n\nSince the maximum kinetic energy is negative, this means that the incident light does not have enough energy to overcome the work function of the metal, and no electrons will be emitted."
