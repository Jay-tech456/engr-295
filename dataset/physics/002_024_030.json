    "message_1": "What is the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and how can it be used to calculate the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures? Use the equation to determine the vapor pressure of water at 50°C given that its enthalpy of vaporization is 40.7 kJ/mol and its vapor pressure at 100°C is 101.3 kPa.",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is a mathematical relationship between the vapor pressure of a substance and its temperature. It is derived from the principles of thermodynamics and is used to predict the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures, given some known values. The equation is as follows:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere:\n- P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization of the substance (in J/mol)\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following information:\n- ΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\n- P1 = 101.3 kPa (vapor pressure at 100°C)\n- T1 = 100°C = 373.15 K\n- T2 = 50°C = 323.15 K\n\nWe want to find the vapor pressure of water at 50°C (P2). We can rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(-40700 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/373.15 K))\n\nP2 ≈ 101.3 kPa * exp(11.89)\n\nP2 ≈ 101.3 kPa * 146000\n\nP2 ≈ 12.4 kPa\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 12.4 kPa."
