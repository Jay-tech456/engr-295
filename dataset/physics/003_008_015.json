    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located parallel to the center of the sheet and 3 cm away from its surface, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to an infinite current-carrying sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the sheet.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 2 A, and the distance d is 3 cm (0.03 m). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.06 m)\n\nB ≈ 4.19 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point parallel to the center of the sheet and 3 cm away from its surface is approximately 4.19 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
