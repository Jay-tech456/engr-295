What is the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth? Use relativistic velocity addition to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth (0.6c), v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship (0.5c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = (0.6c + 0.5c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by c:\n\nv/c = (0.6 + 0.5) / (1 + (0.6 * 0.5))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for v/c:\n\nv/c = (1.1) / (1 + 0.3)\n\nv/c = 1.1 / 1.3\n\nv/c ≈ 0.8461538461538461\n\nNow, multiply by c to get the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth:\n\nv ≈ 0.8461538461538461c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth is approximately 0.846c."
