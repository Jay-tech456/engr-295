    "message_2": "In a Stern-Gerlach experiment, the probability of measuring a particle's spin as up or down along a given axis depends on the projection of the particle's state vector onto the basis states of that axis. In this case, the particle is prepared in the state (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) along the horizontal axis, and we want to find the probability of measuring its spin as up or down along the vertical axis.\n\nFirst, let's express the given state in terms of the vertical axis basis states. The horizontal axis states can be represented as a linear combination of the vertical axis states:\n\n|right> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)\n|left> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>)\n\nSince the particle is prepared in the state (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) along the horizontal axis, this corresponds to the |right> state:\n\n|ψ> = |right> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of measuring the particle's spin as up or down along the vertical axis by projecting the state vector onto the vertical basis states and calculating the squared magnitudes of the projections:\n\nP(up) = |<up|ψ>|^2\nP(down) = |<down|ψ>|^2\n\nUsing the given state vector |ψ>:\n\nP(up) = |<up|(1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)|^2\nP(up) = |(1/sqrt(2))<up|up> + (1/sqrt(2))<up|down>|^2\nP(up) = |(1/sqrt(2))|^2 = 1/2\n\nP(down) = |<down|(1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)|^2\nP(down) = |(1/sqrt(2))<down|up> + (1/sqrt(2))<down|down>|^2\nP(down) = |(1/sqrt(2))|^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the particle's spin as up along the vertical axis is 1/2, and the probability of measuring it as down along the vertical axis is also 1/2."
