    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for the angular position of minima in single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m and the slit width a = 0.02 mm = 0.02 * 10^(-3) m, we can find the angular position of the first minimum (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.02 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 0.0325\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.0325)\nθ ≈ 1.865°\n\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction pattern is approximately 1.865°."
