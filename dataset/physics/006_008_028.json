    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - Φ\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the light, and Φ is the work function.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency of the light. We can use the equation:\n\nc = λf\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nf = c / λ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (530 x 10^-9 m) = 5.66 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow we can find the maximum kinetic energy:\n\nK_max = hf - Φ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (5.66 x 10^14 Hz) - (2.1 eV)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the work function from eV to Joules:\n\nΦ = 2.1 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.36 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, calculate K_max:\n\nK_max = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (5.66 x 10^14 Hz) - (3.36 x 10^-19 J) = 3.75 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo convert the kinetic energy back to eV, divide by the conversion factor:\n\nK_max = (3.75 x 10^-19 J) / (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.34 eV\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy of the electron emitted from the Rubidium atom is 2.34 eV."
