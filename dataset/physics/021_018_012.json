    "message_2": "The gravitational lensing phenomenon occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a black hole, bends the path of light coming from a distant source, like a star or galaxy. This bending of light causes the source to appear distorted or magnified, and sometimes even creates multiple images of the source.\n\nThe effect of the mass and distance of a black hole on gravitational lensing can be understood through the concept of the Einstein radius, which is a measure of the angular separation between the true position of the source and its lensed image. The Einstein radius (θ_E) is given by the following formula:\n\nθ_E = √(4GM/c² * D_LS / (D_L * D_S))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, D_L is the distance from the observer to the black hole (lens), D_S is the distance from the observer to the source, and D_LS is the distance from the black hole to the source.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the gravitational lensing effect depends on the mass of the black hole (M) and the distances involved (D_L, D_S, and D_LS). A more massive black hole or a closer black hole will result in a larger Einstein radius, leading to a stronger lensing effect.\n\nTo estimate the mass of the black hole using gravitational lensing, we can rearrange the Einstein radius formula to solve for M:\n\nM = (c² * θ_E² * D_L * D_S) / (4G * D_LS)\n\nBy observing the lensing effect (i.e., measuring the Einstein radius) and knowing the distances involved, we can calculate the mass of the black hole. This is done in practice by analyzing the positions and brightness of lensed images of distant sources, and using additional information such as the redshifts of the source and lens to determine the distances involved."
