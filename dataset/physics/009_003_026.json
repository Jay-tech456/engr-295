    "message_1": "A student wants to make a periscope using two rectangular prisms, each with a refractive index of 1.5. The prisms will be glued together with a 90-degree angle between them. What should be the minimum angle of incidence at the first surface of the prism so that the light beam undergoes total internal reflection at the interface of the two prisms?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection at the interface of the two prisms, we first need to find the critical angle for the given refractive index.\n\nThe critical angle (θ_c) can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(θ₂)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ₂ = 90° and n₂ = 1 (refractive index of air). The refractive index of the prism is n₁ = 1.5. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ_c) = 1 * sin(90°)\nsin(θ_c) = 1 / 1.5\nθ_c = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ_c ≈ 41.81°\n\nNow, let's consider the first surface of the prism. The angle of incidence (θ_i) at the first surface should be such that the angle of refraction (θ_r) inside the prism is equal to 90° - θ_c. This is because the light beam should hit the interface between the two prisms at the critical angle for total internal reflection to occur.\n\nUsing Snell's Law again:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ_i) = n₂ * sin(θ_r)\n\nSince the light is entering the prism from air, n₁ = 1 and n₂ = 1.5. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1 * sin(θ_i) = 1.5 * sin(90° - θ_c)\nsin(θ_i) = 1.5 * cos(θ_c)\n\nθ_i = arcsin(1.5 * cos(θ_c))\n\nPlugging in the value of θ_c ≈ 41.81°, we get:\n\nθ_i = arcsin(1.5 * cos(41.81°))\nθ_i ≈ 56.44°\n\nTherefore, the minimum angle of incidence at the first surface of the prism should be approximately 56.44° for the light beam to undergo total internal reflection at the interface of the two prisms."
