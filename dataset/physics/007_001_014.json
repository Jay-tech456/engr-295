    "message_2": "To initiate a nuclear fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei, we need to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons in the nuclei. This repulsion is described by the Coulomb barrier. The minimum energy required to overcome this barrier can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nE = (k * e^2) / r\n\nwhere E is the energy required, k is the Coulomb constant (8.9875 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2), e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), and r is the distance between the two nuclei.\n\nFor deuterium nuclei, the distance r can be approximated as the sum of their nuclear radii. The nuclear radius can be estimated using the formula:\n\nr = r0 * A^(1/3)\n\nwhere r0 is a constant (1.2 x 10^-15 m) and A is the mass number of the nucleus. For deuterium, A = 2.\n\nr = 1.2 x 10^-15 m * 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.44 x 10^-15 m\n\nNow we can calculate the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier:\n\nE = (8.9875 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)^2 / (1.44 x 10^-15 m) ≈ 1.44 x 10^-14 J\n\nThis energy can be converted to electron volts (eV) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nE ≈ 1.44 x 10^-14 J * (1 eV / 1.602 x 10^-19 J) ≈ 90 keV\n\nSo, the minimum energy required to initiate a nuclear fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei is approximately 90 keV.\n\nFor a nuclear fission reaction to occur between uranium-235 atoms, the energy required is much lower. Typically, a neutron with an energy of around 0.025 eV (thermal energy) can initiate a fission reaction in uranium-235. This is known as thermal fission.\n\nComparing the two values, the minimum energy required for a nuclear fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei (90 keV) is significantly higher than the minimum energy required for a nuclear fission reaction to occur between uranium-235 atoms (0.025 eV). This difference in energy requirements is one of the reasons why nuclear fission is currently more feasible for power generation than nuclear fusion."
