    "message_2": "The separation of isotopes can be achieved using the method of gas diffusion by exploiting the difference in molecular weights of the isotopes. In the case of uranium, the two isotopes of interest are Uranium-235 (U-235) and Uranium-238 (U-238). The process involves converting solid uranium into a gaseous compound, such as uranium hexafluoride (UF6), which can then be subjected to diffusion through a porous barrier. The lighter isotope (U-235) will diffuse slightly faster than the heavier isotope (U-238), leading to a gradual separation of the isotopes.\n\nTo calculate the enrichment factor, we first need to know the natural abundance of U-235 and U-238. The natural abundance of U-235 is approximately 0.72%, and that of U-238 is approximately 99.28%.\n\nLet's assume we have 1 kg of natural uranium, which we want to enrich to contain 3% of U-235. \n\nInitial mass of U-235 = 0.0072 * 1000 g = 7.2 g\nInitial mass of U-238 = 0.9928 * 1000 g = 992.8 g\n\nLet x be the mass of uranium that is enriched to 3% U-235.\n\n0.03 * x = 7.2 g (since the mass of U-235 remains constant)\n\nx = 7.2 / 0.03 = 240 g\n\nThe enrichment factor is the ratio of the mass of enriched uranium to the mass of natural uranium:\n\nEnrichment factor = x / 1000 = 240 / 1000 = 0.24\n\nNow, let's calculate the new atomic weight of the enriched uranium sample. The atomic weight of U-235 is 235 g/mol, and that of U-238 is 238 g/mol.\n\nNew atomic weight = (mass fraction of U-235 * atomic weight of U-235) + (mass fraction of U-238 * atomic weight of U-238)\n\nMass fraction of U-235 in enriched uranium = 0.03\nMass fraction of U-238 in enriched uranium = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97\n\nNew atomic weight = (0.03 * 235) + (0.97 * 238) = 7.05 + 230.86 = 237.91 g/mol\n\nThe new atomic weight of the enriched uranium sample is approximately 237.91 g/mol."
