    "message_2": "The specific impulse (Isp) of a thruster can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nIsp = Thrust / (mass flow rate * g0)\n\nwhere g0 is the standard acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass flow rate from mg/s to kg/s:\n\n3 mg/s = 0.003 g/s = 0.000003 kg/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the specific impulse:\n\nIsp = 0.1 N / (0.000003 kg/s * 9.81 m/s²) = 0.1 N / 0.00002943 N/s\n\nIsp ≈ 3398.6 s\n\nSo, the specific impulse of the plasma thruster is approximately 3398.6 seconds."
