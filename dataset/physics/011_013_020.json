    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity (σ) of a material is the reciprocal of its resistivity (ρ). Given the resistivity of copper at 25°C is 1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm, we can calculate its electrical conductivity as follows:\n\nσ = 1/ρ\nσ = 1/(1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.95 x 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of copper at 25°C is approximately 5.95 x 10^7 Siemens per meter (S/m).\n\nNow, let's provide an explanation using Drude's model of electron motion in metals. According to Drude's model, the motion of electrons in a metal can be described as a classical gas of free electrons. These electrons are constantly moving and colliding with the metal ions, which are considered as fixed obstacles. The average time between these collisions is called the relaxation time (τ).\n\nThe electrical conductivity (σ) in Drude's model can be expressed as:\n\nσ = n * e^2 * τ / m\n\nwhere n is the number density of free electrons (number of free electrons per unit volume), e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), τ is the relaxation time, and m is the effective mass of an electron in the metal.\n\nThe resistivity of copper at 25°C is mainly influenced by the relaxation time (τ) and the number density of free electrons (n). As the temperature increases, the relaxation time decreases due to more frequent collisions between electrons and metal ions. However, at 25°C, the resistivity of copper is relatively low, which means that the relaxation time is relatively long, and the number density of free electrons is high. This results in a high electrical conductivity for copper at this temperature.\n\nIn summary, the electrical conductivity of copper at 25°C is approximately 5.95 x 10^7 S/m, and this high conductivity can be explained by Drude's model of electron motion in metals, which considers the motion of electrons as a classical gas of free electrons colliding with fixed metal ions."
