    "message_2": "Brewster's law states that the angle of polarization (also called the Brewster angle) occurs when the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction are such that the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other. At this angle, the reflected light is completely polarized. The Brewster's law formula is given by:\n\ntan(θ_p) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere θ_p is the Brewster angle, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (air in this case), and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the refractive index of glass for the given wavelength of light (500 nm). The refractive index of glass varies with the wavelength of light, but for most common types of glass, the refractive index at 500 nm is approximately 1.5.\n\nNow, we can use the Brewster's law formula to find the angle of polarization:\n\ntan(θ_p) = n2 / n1 = 1.5 / 1 = 1.5\n\nTo find the Brewster angle, we take the arctangent of both sides:\n\nθ_p = arctan(1.5)\n\nθ_p ≈ 56.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of polarization (Brewster angle) for the reflected light is approximately 56.3 degrees."
