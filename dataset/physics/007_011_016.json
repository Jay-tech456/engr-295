Use the relationship between a star's mass and its luminosity to determine the star's energy output, and then apply the equations for nuclear fusion and energy generation to estimate how long the star can sustain itself before exhausting its fuel and exploding.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of a star with 1.5 solar masses, we can use the mass-luminosity relation and the equations for nuclear fusion and energy generation.\n\nThe mass-luminosity relation is given by:\n\nL = M^3.5\n\nwhere L is the luminosity of the star in solar units (L_sun) and M is the mass of the star in solar masses (M_sun). For a star with 1.5 solar masses, we have:\n\nL = (1.5)^3.5 ≈ 2.65 L_sun\n\nNow, we need to determine the amount of energy generated by the star through nuclear fusion. The main source of energy for a star is the fusion of hydrogen into helium. The mass fraction of hydrogen that can be converted into helium is about 10%. Therefore, the mass of hydrogen available for fusion is:\n\nM_H = 0.1 * M = 0.1 * 1.5 M_sun ≈ 0.15 M_sun\n\nThe energy generated per unit mass during the fusion of hydrogen into helium is about 0.007 times the mass-energy equivalent (E=mc^2). So, the total energy generated by the star is:\n\nE = 0.007 * M_H * c^2\nE ≈ 0.007 * 0.15 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 1.27 x 10^44 Joules\n\nNow, we can calculate the star's energy output per second using its luminosity:\n\nL_star = L * L_sun\nL_star ≈ 2.65 * (3.828 x 10^26 W)\nL_star ≈ 1.014 x 10^27 W\n\nFinally, we can estimate the lifetime of the star by dividing the total energy generated by the energy output per second:\n\nt = E / L_star\nt ≈ (1.27 x 10^44 J) / (1.014 x 10^27 W)\nt ≈ 1.25 x 10^17 seconds\n\nTo convert this to years, we can use the conversion factor of 1 year ≈ 3.1536 x 10^7 seconds:\n\nt ≈ (1.25 x 10^17 s) / (3.1536 x 10^7 s/year)\nt ≈ 3.96 x 10^9 years\n\nSo, the lifetime of a star with 1.5 solar masses is approximately 3.96 billion years before it exhausts its fuel and undergoes a supernova explosion."
