    "message_2": "To find the Boyle temperature, we need to first find the number of moles (n) of the gas using the Ideal Gas Law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nP = 2 atm\nV = 5 L\nR = 0.082 L·atm/K·mol\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) using the Ideal Gas Law:\n\n2 atm * 5 L = n * 0.082 L·atm/K·mol * 298 K\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = (2 atm * 5 L) / (0.082 L·atm/K·mol * 298 K)\nn ≈ 0.407 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the mass (m) of the gas using the molar mass (M):\n\nm = n * M\nm = 0.407 moles * 28 g/mol\nm ≈ 11.4 g\n\nBoyle's Law states that the product of pressure and volume is constant for a given amount of gas at a constant temperature:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n\nBoyle temperature (T_B) is the temperature at which a gas's volume is directly proportional to its pressure, assuming the number of moles and the mass of the gas remain constant. To find the Boyle temperature, we need to find the temperature at which the gas obeys Boyle's Law.\n\nSince the mass and the number of moles of the gas remain constant, we can use the Ideal Gas Law to find the Boyle temperature:\n\nP1V1 = nRT_B\n\nWe know the initial pressure (P1) and volume (V1) of the gas, as well as the number of moles (n) and the gas constant (R). We can plug these values into the equation and solve for T_B:\n\n(2 atm * 5 L) = 0.407 moles * 0.082 L·atm/K·mol * T_B\n\nSolving for T_B:\n\nT_B = (2 atm * 5 L) / (0.407 moles * 0.082 L·atm/K·mol)\nT_B ≈ 297.6 K\n\nThe Boyle temperature of the gas sample is approximately 297.6 K."
