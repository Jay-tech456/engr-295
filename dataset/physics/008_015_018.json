    "message_2": "The mechanism responsible for generating mass in the Standard Model theory is known as the Higgs mechanism. It is a process that endows fundamental particles with mass through their interaction with the Higgs field, a scalar field that permeates all of space. The Higgs field is associated with the Higgs boson, a particle discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\n\nIn the Standard Model, particles acquire mass through their interaction with the Higgs field. The Higgs field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), meaning that even in its lowest energy state, it has a non-zero value. This is unlike other fields, which have a zero VEV in their lowest energy state. This non-zero VEV is what allows the Higgs field to give mass to particles.\n\nWhen particles like quarks, leptons, and the W and Z bosons (the carriers of the weak nuclear force) interact with the Higgs field, they acquire mass. The strength of their interaction with the Higgs field determines the mass of the particle. Particles that interact strongly with the Higgs field have a larger mass, while those that interact weakly have a smaller mass. Photons, for example, do not interact with the Higgs field, and thus have zero mass.\n\nThe Higgs boson is a manifestation of the Higgs field. It is an excitation of the field, much like how a photon is an excitation of the electromagnetic field. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and validated the Higgs mechanism as the process responsible for generating mass in the Standard Model theory."
