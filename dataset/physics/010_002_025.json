    "message_2": "To determine the pressure drop per unit length of the pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a horizontal pipe:\n\nΔP/L = (8 * μ * Q) / (π * R^4)\n\nwhere ΔP is the pressure drop, L is the length of the pipe, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, Q is the volumetric flow rate, and R is the radius of the pipe.\n\nGiven:\nμ = 0.004 Pa.s (viscosity)\nD = 0.02 m (diameter of the pipe)\nQ = 0.01 m³/s (volumetric flow rate)\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the pipe:\nR = D / 2 = 0.02 m / 2 = 0.01 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\nΔP/L = (8 * 0.004 Pa.s * 0.01 m³/s) / (π * (0.01 m)^4)\n\nΔP/L = (0.00032 Pa.m³/s) / (π * 1e-8 m^4)\n\nΔP/L ≈ 10197.44 Pa/m\n\nSo, the pressure drop per unit length of the pipe is approximately 10197.44 Pa/m."
