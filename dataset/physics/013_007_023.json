Use observational data on the rotational velocity of stars in the outer regions of the Milky Way to estimate the mass distribution of the galaxy's dark matter halo.",
    "message_2": "The mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo can be estimated using the observed rotational velocities of stars in the outer regions of the galaxy. The rotation curve of the Milky Way, which plots the rotational velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the galactic center, can provide insights into the distribution of mass within the galaxy.\n\nIn a galaxy with only visible matter, the rotation curve would be expected to decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center, following Kepler's laws. However, observations of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies show that the rotation curve remains relatively flat or even slightly increases at large distances from the center. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\nTo estimate the mass of the dark matter halo, we can use the following equation:\n\nM(r) = (V^2 * r) / G\n\nwhere M(r) is the mass enclosed within a radius r, V is the rotational velocity at that radius, and G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2).\n\nUsing observational data, the rotational velocity of stars in the outer regions of the Milky Way is found to be roughly constant at about 220 km/s (or 220,000 m/s). Let's consider a radius of 50,000 light-years (approximately 4.73 x 10^20 meters) as the outer edge of the visible disk.\n\nNow we can calculate the enclosed mass:\n\nM(r) = (220,000 m/s)^2 * (4.73 x 10^20 m) / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM(r) ≈ 1.15 x 10^42 kg\n\nThis value represents the total mass enclosed within the considered radius, including both visible and dark matter. To estimate the mass of the dark matter halo, we can subtract the mass of the visible matter, which is estimated to be around 5 x 10^41 kg.\n\nMass of dark matter halo ≈ 1.15 x 10^42 kg - 5 x 10^41 kg\nMass of dark matter halo ≈ 6.5 x 10^41 kg\n\nThe distribution of dark matter in the galaxy is not well understood, but it is believed to form a roughly spherical halo surrounding the visible disk. The density of dark matter is thought to decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center, but the exact profile is still a subject of ongoing research. Some popular models for the dark matter distribution include the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and the Einasto profile, which describe the density of dark matter as a function of distance from the galactic center."
