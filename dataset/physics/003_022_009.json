    "message_1": "A motor has a coil of 200 turns and a radius of 0.05 meters. The coil carries a current of 2 amperes. What is the magnetic field at a point 0.02 meters away from the center of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.02 meters away from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * r²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current (2 A)\nN is the number of turns (200)\nr is the radius of the coil (0.05 m)\nR is the distance from the center of the coil (0.02 m)\nx is the axial distance from the center of the coil (0 in this case, since we are considering a point on the plane of the coil)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 200 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.02 m² + 0²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 200 * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0004 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 200 * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * 0.0008 m³)\n\nB = (1.6π × 10^(-6) Tm²) / 0.0008 m³\n\nB ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.02 meters away from the center of the coil is approximately 6.283 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
