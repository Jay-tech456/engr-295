    "message_2": "To determine the length of the spaceship as measured by a person inside the spaceship, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction states that the length of an object moving at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light) will appear shorter to an observer in a stationary frame of reference.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length as observed by the stationary observer (in this case, the observer on Earth), L0 is the proper length as measured by the person inside the spaceship, v is the relative velocity between the two frames of reference, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given L (100m) and v (0.6c), and we need to find L0. We can rearrange the formula to solve for L0:\n\nL0 = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL0 = 100m / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nL0 = 100m / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nL0 = 100m / sqrt(0.64)\n\nL0 = 100m / 0.8\nL0 = 125m\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by a person inside the spaceship is 125 meters."
