    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that a cosmic ray particle can carry is typically measured in electron volts (eV). The most energetic cosmic rays detected so far are known as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which can have energies up to about 10^20 eV or 100 exa-electron volts (EeV). These extremely energetic particles are quite rare, and their origin is still a topic of ongoing research in astrophysics.\n\nWhen a cosmic ray particle, such as a high-energy proton or atomic nucleus, crashes into electronics, it can cause a phenomenon called single-event upset (SEU). SEUs can lead to temporary malfunctions, data corruption, or even permanent damage to electronic components. The extent of the damage depends on the energy of the particle and the sensitivity of the electronic device.\n\nIn general, the higher the energy of the cosmic ray particle, the more likely it is to cause damage. However, the probability of a high-energy cosmic ray particle interacting with a specific electronic device is relatively low. To mitigate the risk of cosmic ray-induced damage, engineers often use radiation-hardened components and error-correcting codes in critical systems, particularly in space applications where exposure to cosmic rays is higher than on Earth's surface.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of energy a cosmic ray particle can carry is around 10^20 eV, and the potential damage it can cause to electronics ranges from temporary malfunctions to permanent damage, depending on the energy of the particle and the sensitivity of the device."
