    "message_2": "Hawking radiation is a theoretical process by which black holes can lose mass and energy due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon has significant implications for the thermodynamics of black holes and their eventual evaporation.\n\n1. Temperature: According to the laws of thermodynamics, all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. Hawking showed that black holes have a temperature, which is inversely proportional to their mass. This temperature is known as the Hawking temperature. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses mass, causing its temperature to increase.\n\n2. Entropy: In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. As a black hole emits Hawking radiation and loses mass, its event horizon area decreases, leading to a decrease in entropy. This is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease.\n\n3. Energy loss: As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, it loses energy. This energy loss is equivalent to a decrease in the black hole's mass, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. The rate of energy loss is higher for smaller black holes, as they have higher temperatures and emit more radiation.\n\n4. Evaporation: Over time, the energy loss due to Hawking radiation causes the black hole to lose mass and shrink. Eventually, the black hole will become so small and hot that it will emit radiation at an extremely high rate. This process will continue until the black hole has lost all of its mass and completely evaporates. The time it takes for a black hole to evaporate depends on its initial mass, with smaller black holes evaporating faster than larger ones.\n\nIn summary, Hawking radiation affects the thermodynamics of a black hole by causing it to have a temperature, lose energy, and decrease in entropy. Over time, these effects lead to the black hole's eventual evaporation."
