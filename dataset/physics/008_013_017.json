    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a heavier relative of the electron and muon, and it decays via the weak force. Its decay modes can be broadly classified into two categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays. Here are the main decay modes and their approximate probabilities:\n\n1. Leptonic decays (35.2%):\n   a. τ → eνeντ (17.8%): Tau decays into an electron, an electron neutrino, and a tau neutrino.\n   b. τ → μνμντ (17.4%): Tau decays into a muon, a muon neutrino, and a tau neutrino.\n\n2. Hadronic decays (64.8%):\n   a. τ → πντ (10.9%): Tau decays into a charged pion and a tau neutrino.\n   b. τ → ρντ (25.5%): Tau decays into a rho meson and a tau neutrino.\n   c. τ → a1ντ (9.5%): Tau decays into an a1 meson and a tau neutrino.\n   d. Other hadronic decay modes (18.9%): These include decays involving multiple mesons, such as Kπ, KK, Kππ, etc., along with their corresponding tau neutrinos.\n\nThese probabilities are approximate values, and the actual branching ratios may vary slightly depending on the specific experimental measurements."
