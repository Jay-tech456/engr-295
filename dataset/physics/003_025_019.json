    "message_1": "A copper wire of length 2 meters and diameter 1 mm is carrying a current of 5 A. What is the magnetic field produced at a distance of 4 cm from the wire? Assume the wire is a perfect resistor.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by the wire at a distance of 4 cm, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current in the wire = 5 A\nr = distance from the wire = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.08 m)\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is 2.5 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
