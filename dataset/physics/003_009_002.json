    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a solid sphere with radius R and carrying a current I uniformly distributed over its volume, we can use Ampere's Law and the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the problem involves a continuous distribution of current, it is more convenient to use the Biot-Savart Law.\n\nFirst, let's consider a small volume element dV within the sphere, located at a distance r from the center of the sphere and subtending a solid angle dΩ at the point P on the axis where we want to find the magnetic field. The current density J can be expressed as:\n\nJ = I / (4/3 * π * R^3)\n\nThe current through the volume element dV is:\n\ndI = J * dV\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the contribution of the magnetic field dB due to this small current element dI at point P:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dV * sinθ) / (r^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, and θ is the angle between the position vector r and the axis of the sphere.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire volume of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dV * sinθ) / (r^2)\n\nSince the problem has spherical symmetry, we can simplify the integration by converting it to spherical coordinates:\n\nB = ∫(0 to R) ∫(0 to π) ∫(0 to 2π) (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * r^2 * sinθ * dr * dθ * dφ) / (r^2)\n\nNow, we can perform the integration:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(0 to R) ∫(0 to π) ∫(0 to 2π) (dI * sinθ * dr * dθ * dφ)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * ∫(0 to R) ∫(0 to π) (dI * sinθ * dr * dθ)\n\nSince dI is constant with respect to θ, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * dI * ∫(0 to R) ∫(0 to π) (sinθ * dr * dθ)\n\nNow, we can perform the integration over θ:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * dI * ∫(0 to R) (-cosθ | from 0 to π) * dr\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * dI * ∫(0 to R) (2 * dr)\n\nFinally, we can perform the integration over r:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * dI * (r | from 0 to R)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * dI * R\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for dI:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * (J * dV) * R\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the volume of the sphere, we can replace dV with (4/3 * π * R^3):\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * (J * (4/3 * π * R^3)) * R\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for J:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2π) * (I / (4/3 * π * R^3) * (4/3 * π * R^3)) * R\n\nAfter simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R) / (2 * R^3)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a solid sphere with radius R and carrying a current I uniformly distributed over its volume is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R) / (2 * R^3)"
