    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a velocity of 0.9c relative to Earth. An alien on the spaceship observes a light signal that is sent from Earth to the spaceship. If it takes 10 seconds for the light to reach the spaceship according to the alien on board, how long did it take for the light signal to travel from Earth to the spaceship according to an observer on Earth? Use Lorentz transformation equations to calculate.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lorentz transformation equations for time dilation. The time dilation equation is:\n\nt = t' / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time observed by the observer on Earth, t' is the time observed by the alien on the spaceship, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.9c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given t' = 10 seconds and v = 0.9c. We need to find t.\n\nt = 10 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\n\nt = 10 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\n\nt = 10 / sqrt(0.19)\n\nt ≈ 10 / 0.4359\n\nt ≈ 22.94 seconds\n\nSo, according to an observer on Earth, it took approximately 22.94 seconds for the light signal to travel from Earth to the spaceship."
