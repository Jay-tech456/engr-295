    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a convex lens, we can use the lensmaker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. In this case, n = 1.5, R1 = 10 cm, and R2 = -5 cm (since the second surface is convex to the right, its radius of curvature is negative).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1) * (1/10 - 1/(-5))\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/10 + 1/5)\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/10 + 2/10)\n1/f = 0.5 * (3/10)\n1/f = 3/20\n\nNow, we can find the focal length by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nf = 20/3 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the convex lens is approximately 6.67 cm."
