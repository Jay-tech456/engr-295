    "message_2": "The accepted value of the top quark mass, according to the latest measurements, is approximately 172.76 GeV/c². This value is based on a combination of measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron collider.\n\nThe top quark was discovered in 1995 at the Tevatron collider, and its mass has been measured with increasing precision over the years. Initially, the top quark mass was measured to be around 176 GeV/c². As more data were collected and experimental techniques improved, the uncertainty in the top quark mass measurements has been reduced, leading to the current value of 172.76 GeV/c² with an uncertainty of about 0.3 GeV/c².\n\nThe precise measurement of the top quark mass is crucial for understanding the properties of the Higgs boson and testing the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics. It also plays a significant role in constraining new physics beyond the Standard Model."
