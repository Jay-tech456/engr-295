    "message_2": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that aims to address some of its limitations and unsolved problems. In SUSY, each particle in the Standard Model has a corresponding \"superpartner\" with a spin difference of 1/2. These superpartners have not been observed yet, but their existence would help explain the hierarchy problem, dark matter, and the unification of forces.\n\nThe Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. Its decay modes and branching ratios have been measured and found to be consistent with the Standard Model predictions. The main decay channels for the Higgs boson in the Standard Model are:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quark-antiquark pair (H → bb)\n2. Higgs to W boson pair (H → WW)\n3. Higgs to tau lepton-antilepton pair (H → ττ)\n4. Higgs to Z boson pair (H → ZZ)\n5. Higgs to gluon pair (H → gg)\n6. Higgs to photon pair (H → γγ)\n\nIn Supersymmetry, the Higgs sector is extended, and there are additional Higgs bosons: two charged Higgs (H+ and H-) and three neutral Higgs (h, H, and A). The lightest neutral Higgs (h) is often identified with the observed Higgs boson. In SUSY, the decay modes of the Higgs boson can be modified due to the presence of superpartners and additional Higgs bosons. Some possible new decay channels in SUSY are:\n\n1. Higgs to neutralinos or charginos (e.g., H → χ1χ2, where χ1 and χ2 are neutralinos)\n2. Higgs to sfermions (e.g., H → ŝ1ŝ1*, where ŝ1 is a scalar partner of a fermion)\n3. Higgs to other Higgs bosons (e.g., H → hh, H → AA)\n\nThe exact predictions for the decay modes and branching ratios in SUSY depend on the specific SUSY model and its parameters. In some cases, the SUSY contributions to the Higgs decay can be small, and the decay modes would be similar to those in the Standard Model. In other cases, the SUSY contributions can be significant, leading to deviations from the Standard Model predictions.\n\nSo far, the observed decay modes of the Higgs boson are consistent with the Standard Model, and no clear evidence for SUSY contributions has been found. However, this does not rule out SUSY, as the superpartners and additional Higgs bosons could still be too heavy to be produced at the current collider energies, or their contributions to the Higgs decay could be small. Future experiments and more precise measurements of the Higgs properties could provide further insights into the possible role of Supersymmetry in the Higgs sector."
