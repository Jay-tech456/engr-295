    "message_1": "What is the estimated abundance of dark matter in our universe and how does its distribution affect the observed large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters and filaments, in the universe?",
    "message_2": "The estimated abundance of dark matter in our universe is approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content. This is in contrast to the 5% of ordinary (baryonic) matter and the remaining 68% being attributed to dark energy. These values are derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as from computer simulations.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and filaments. Due to its gravitational influence, dark matter acts as a cosmic scaffolding that attracts baryonic matter, allowing it to clump together and form galaxies and galaxy clusters. The distribution of dark matter is not uniform throughout the universe; it is concentrated in massive halos that surround galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe presence of dark matter can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the motion of galaxy clusters. Additionally, dark matter affects the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation, which provides further evidence for its existence and abundance.\n\nIn summary, the estimated abundance of dark matter in our universe is about 27% of the total mass-energy content. Its distribution plays a vital role in shaping the large-scale structures we observe, such as galaxy clusters and filaments, by providing the gravitational framework necessary for the formation and evolution of these structures."
