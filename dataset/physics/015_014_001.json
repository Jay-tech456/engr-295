    "message_2": "To estimate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with a mass range between 10-100 times that of the sun, we can use the properties of gravitational waves from binary black hole systems. The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves depend on the masses of the black holes and their orbital separation.\n\n1. Frequency: The frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system is twice the orbital frequency. For a binary system with two black holes of masses M1 and M2, and an orbital separation r, the orbital frequency (f_orb) can be calculated using Kepler's third law:\n\nf_orb = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. The gravitational wave frequency (f_GW) is then:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orb\n\nFor PBHs with masses between 10-100 times the solar mass (M_sun), the frequency will depend on the specific masses and orbital separations of the binary systems. However, we can expect the frequency to be in the range of ~10 Hz to a few hundred Hz, which is within the sensitivity range of current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo.\n\n2. Amplitude: The amplitude of gravitational waves (h) depends on the masses of the black holes, their orbital separation, and the distance to the binary system (D). The amplitude can be estimated as:\n\nh ~ (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * D)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light. For PBHs with masses between 10-100 times M_sun, the amplitude will depend on the specific masses, orbital separations, and distances of the binary systems. However, we can expect the amplitude to be within the sensitivity range of current gravitational wave detectors for nearby sources.\n\n3. Sensitivity requirements: To detect gravitational waves from PBHs with masses between 10-100 times M_sun, a gravitational wave detector should be sensitive to frequencies in the range of ~10 Hz to a few hundred Hz and have a strain sensitivity (h) on the order of 10^-22 or better. Current detectors like LIGO and Virgo already meet these requirements, and future detectors like LISA and Einstein Telescope will have even better sensitivities.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves from a population of primordial black holes with masses between 10-100 times the solar mass will depend on the specific masses and orbital separations of the binary systems. However, we can expect the frequency to be in the range of ~10 Hz to a few hundred Hz, and the amplitude to be within the sensitivity range of current gravitational wave detectors for nearby sources. The sensitivity requirements for a gravitational wave detector to successfully detect these waves are a frequency range of ~10 Hz to a few hundred Hz and a strain sensitivity on the order of 10^-22 or better."
