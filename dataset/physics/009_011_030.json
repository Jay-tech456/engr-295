    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's equation relates the focal length (f) of a lens to the radii of curvature of its two surfaces (R1 and R2) and the refractive index (n) of the lens material. The equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nIn this problem, we are given the focal length (f = 25 cm) and the refractive index (n = 1.5). We are asked to find the radius of curvature of the lens. Since we are not given any information about the second surface, we will assume that the lens is a plano-convex lens, meaning that one surface is flat (R2 = ∞) and the other surface has a radius of curvature R1.\n\nNow, we can plug the given values into the Lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/25 = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/∞)\n\n1/25 = 0.5 * (1/R1)\n\nTo find R1, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nR1 = 1 / (1/25 * 2)\n\nR1 = 1 / (1/12.5)\n\nR1 = 12.5 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the lens is 12.5 cm."
