    "message_1": "A coil with radius 0.1 meters has 200 turns and carries a current of 3 amps. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 200 * 3 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 600 A) / 0.2 m\n\nB = (2.4π × 10⁻⁴ Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 12π × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 12π × 10⁻⁴ T or 3.77 × 10⁻³ T."
