Given that the speed of light in vacuum is 3×10^8 m/s, the wavelength of the light inside the material is reduced to 480 nm and the material is a non-magnetic and non-absorbing dielectric.",
    "message_2": "To find the refractive index of the material, we can use the formula for the speed of light in a medium:\n\nv = c / n\n\nwhere v is the speed of light in the medium, c is the speed of light in vacuum (3×10^8 m/s), and n is the refractive index.\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of light in the medium. We can do this by using the relationship between the wavelength of light in vacuum (λ₀) and the wavelength of light in the medium (λ):\n\nλ₀ / λ = c / v\n\nWe are given that λ₀ = 600 nm and λ = 480 nm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n(600 nm) / (480 nm) = (3×10^8 m/s) / v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = (3×10^8 m/s) * (480 nm) / (600 nm) = (3×10^8 m/s) * (4/5) = 2.4×10^8 m/s\n\nNow that we have the speed of light in the medium, we can find the refractive index using the formula v = c / n:\n\nn = c / v = (3×10^8 m/s) / (2.4×10^8 m/s) = 1.25\n\nTherefore, the refractive index of the material is 1.25."
