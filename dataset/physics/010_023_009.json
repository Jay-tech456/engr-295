    "message_2": "The maximum wind speed that a hurricane can reach depends on several factors, including the Coriolis effect and sea surface temperature (SST). However, it is important to note that other factors, such as atmospheric conditions and the storm's structure, also play a role in determining the maximum wind speed.\n\nThe Coriolis effect is a result of Earth's rotation, which causes moving objects to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect is essential for the formation and intensification of hurricanes, as it causes the rotation of the storm system. However, the Coriolis effect alone does not determine the maximum wind speed of a hurricane.\n\nThe sea surface temperature is a critical factor in hurricane development and intensification. Warmer SSTs provide more energy for the storm, allowing it to grow stronger. According to the research, a hurricane's maximum potential intensity (MPI) is directly related to the SST. The higher the SST, the higher the MPI.\n\nA widely used formula to estimate the maximum potential intensity of a hurricane is the one developed by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, which takes into account the SST, the temperature of the outflow layer in the atmosphere, and the efficiency with which the heat is converted into mechanical energy (Carnot efficiency). The formula is as follows:\n\nVmax = (Ck * Ce * (SST - T0))^0.5\n\nWhere Vmax is the maximum wind speed, Ck is the exchange coefficient for enthalpy, Ce is the exchange coefficient for momentum, SST is the sea surface temperature, and T0 is the outflow temperature.\n\nIn general, hurricanes require a minimum SST of around 26.5°C (80°F) to form and intensify. As the SST increases, so does the potential for stronger hurricanes. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified estimation and other factors, such as wind shear and humidity, can also influence the maximum wind speed of a hurricane.\n\nIn summary, there is no fixed maximum wind speed for a hurricane based solely on the Coriolis effect and sea surface temperature, as other factors also play a role. However, higher SSTs generally lead to stronger hurricanes, and the Coriolis effect is essential for the formation and rotation of these storm systems."
