    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic energy and momentum of a particle moving at 0.95c (where c is the speed of light), we'll use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E): E = γmc^2, where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n2. Relativistic momentum (p): p = γmv, where v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nGiven that the particle is moving at 0.95c, we have:\n\nv = 0.95c\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.95c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.95^2)\nγ ≈ 3.2026\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE ≈ 3.2026 * 10 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 2.877 * 10^18 Joules\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np ≈ 3.2026 * 10 kg * 0.95c\np ≈ 3.2026 * 10 kg * 0.95 * (3 * 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 9.107 * 10^8 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the particle is approximately 2.877 * 10^18 Joules, and its relativistic momentum is approximately 9.107 * 10^8 kg m/s."
