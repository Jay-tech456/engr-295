    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔG°f(products) - ΔG°f(reactants)\n\nFor the given reaction:\n\n2Fe(s) + 3/2O2(g) -> Fe2O3(s)\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG°f) for the products is:\n\nΔG°f[Fe2O3(s)] = -740.0 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG°f) for the reactants is:\n\nΔG°f[2Fe(s)] = 2 * ΔG°f[Fe(s)] = 2 * 0 kJ/mol = 0 kJ/mol\n\nSince O2 is in its standard state, its ΔG°f is also 0 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction:\n\nΔG° = (-740.0 kJ/mol) - (0 kJ/mol) = -740.0 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction at 298 K is -740.0 kJ/mol."
