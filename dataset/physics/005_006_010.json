    "message_2": "To determine the ratio of the gravitational potentials at the surface of the planet and at the orbit of the satellite, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\n1 + z = sqrt((1 + 2Φ1/c^2) / (1 + 2Φ2/c^2))\n\nwhere z is the redshift factor, Φ1 is the gravitational potential at the surface of the planet, Φ2 is the gravitational potential at the orbit of the satellite, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the light is redshifted by a factor of 2, we have:\n\n1 + 2 = sqrt((1 + 2Φ1/c^2) / (1 + 2Φ2/c^2))\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n9 = (1 + 2Φ1/c^2) / (1 + 2Φ2/c^2)\n\nNow, let's solve for the ratio Φ1/Φ2:\n\n9(1 + 2Φ2/c^2) = 1 + 2Φ1/c^2\n\n9 + 18Φ2/c^2 = 1 + 2Φ1/c^2\n\n8 = 2Φ1/c^2 - 18Φ2/c^2\n\n4 = Φ1/c^2 - 9Φ2/c^2\n\nNow, let's factor out Φ2/c^2:\n\n4 = (Φ1 - 9Φ2)/c^2\n\n4c^2 = Φ1 - 9Φ2\n\nNow, let's solve for the ratio Φ1/Φ2:\n\nΦ1 = 4c^2 + 9Φ2\n\nΦ1/Φ2 = (4c^2 + 9Φ2) / Φ2\n\nΦ1/Φ2 = 4c^2/Φ2 + 9\n\nSince we are interested in the ratio of the gravitational potentials, we can denote the ratio as R:\n\nR = Φ1/Φ2 = 4c^2/Φ2 + 9\n\nThis equation gives the ratio of the gravitational potentials at the surface of the planet and at the orbit of the satellite in terms of the gravitational potential at the orbit of the satellite (Φ2) and the speed of light (c)."
