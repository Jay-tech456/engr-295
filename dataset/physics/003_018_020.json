    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 7 cm away from the helix axis, we can use the Biot-Savart law. For a tightly wound helix, the magnetic field can be approximated as the magnetic field produced by a solenoid. The formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of turns per unit length (n) in meters:\n\nn = 10 turns/cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.1 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (0.1 turns/m) * (3 A) = 12π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nTo find the magnetic field at a point located 7 cm away from the helix axis, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field outside a solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * n * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the solenoid, x is the distance from the axis, and B_outside is the magnetic field outside the solenoid.\n\nFirst, let's convert the radius and distance to meters:\n\nR = 5 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.05 m\nx = 7 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.07 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field outside the solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (0.1 turns/m) * (3 A) * (0.05 m)² / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.07 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB_outside = (12π × 10⁻⁷ T) * (0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.0049 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB_outside ≈ 3.77 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point located 7 cm away from the helix axis is approximately 3.77 × 10⁻⁵ T."
