    "message_1": "How much energy is released in the process of nuclear fission of Uranium-235 if the initial mass of the nucleus is 235.0439 u and the final masses of the two fission fragments are 94.9183 u and 139.1204 u? (Assuming the mass defect is converted into energy as per Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relation)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the process of nuclear fission of Uranium-235, we first need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the initial mass of the nucleus and the final masses of the fission fragments.\n\nInitial mass of Uranium-235 nucleus: 235.0439 u\nFinal masses of fission fragments: 94.9183 u + 139.1204 u = 234.0387 u\n\nMass defect = Initial mass - Final mass\nMass defect = 235.0439 u - 234.0387 u = 1.0052 u\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relation, E=mc^2, to find the energy released. Here, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). 1 u is approximately 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass defect in kg = 1.0052 u * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/u) = 1.6696 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\n\nE = mc^2\nE = (1.6696 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.6696 x 10^-27 kg * 9.00 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.5026 x 10^-10 kg*m^2/s^2\n\nThe energy released is 1.5026 x 10^-10 kg*m^2/s^2, which is equivalent to 1.5026 x 10^-10 Joules."
