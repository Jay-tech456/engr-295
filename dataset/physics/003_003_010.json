    "message_1": "A toroidal coil has 1000 turns and a radius of 5 cm. If the coil carries a current of 2 A, calculate the magnetic field at a point inside the coil located 2 cm away from its center.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point inside the toroidal coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field of a toroid:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN = 1000 turns\nI = 2 A\nr = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 1000 * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 1000 * 2) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10⁻⁴ T) / 0.04 m\n\nB = 0.02 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point inside the coil located 2 cm away from its center is 0.02 Tesla."
