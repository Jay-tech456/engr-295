    "message_1": "A Physics student is asked to determine the critical angle for a light ray passing from a material with an index of refraction of 1.5 into an optical fiber with an index of refraction of 1.6. If the angle of incidence is 25 degrees, will the light ray undergo total internal reflection? Show your step-by-step calculation.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the light ray will undergo total internal reflection, we first need to find the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two materials, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. Since we want to find the critical angle, we can set θ2 to 90 degrees:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the indices of refraction:\n\nsin(θc) = 1.6 / 1.5\nθc = arcsin(1.6 / 1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 62.46 degrees\n\nNow that we have the critical angle, we can determine if the light ray will undergo total internal reflection. If the angle of incidence (25 degrees) is greater than the critical angle (62.46 degrees), the light ray will undergo total internal reflection. However, since 25 degrees is less than 62.46 degrees, the light ray will not undergo total internal reflection."
