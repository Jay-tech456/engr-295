    "message_2": "An external electric field affects the spectral lines in the hydrogen atom by causing a shift in the energy levels of the atom, which in turn affects the wavelengths of the emitted or absorbed photons. This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect, named after the German physicist Johannes Stark who discovered it in 1913.\n\nThe Stark effect can be understood as the interaction between the electric field and the electric dipole moment of the atom. In the presence of an external electric field, the electron cloud around the nucleus of the hydrogen atom gets distorted, leading to a change in the energy levels of the atom. This causes the spectral lines to shift, either broadening or splitting into multiple components.\n\nThe mathematical relationship between the electric field strength (E) and the shift in energy levels (ΔE) observed in the Stark effect can be derived using perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. For the hydrogen atom, the first-order perturbation to the energy levels due to the external electric field is given by:\n\nΔE = -μ * E\n\nwhere μ is the electric dipole moment of the atom. The electric dipole moment depends on the specific energy level and the orientation of the atom with respect to the electric field. For hydrogen, the dipole moment can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number (n) and the magnetic quantum number (m):\n\nμ = e * a₀ * (3 * m) / (2 * n^2)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge and a₀ is the Bohr radius.\n\nCombining these expressions, the shift in energy levels due to the Stark effect can be written as:\n\nΔE = -e * a₀ * (3 * m * E) / (2 * n^2)\n\nThis equation shows that the shift in energy levels is proportional to the strength of the external electric field (E) and depends on the quantum numbers n and m. The Stark effect leads to the splitting of spectral lines, with the amount of splitting being determined by the electric field strength and the specific energy levels involved."
