    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It is invisible to electromagnetic radiation, making it undetectable by conventional telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several dark matter models, including those based on dark radiation, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and primordial black holes.\n\nDark radiation refers to hypothetical particles that interact with other particles primarily through gravitational forces and are relativistic, meaning they travel at speeds close to the speed of light. These particles are also known as \"hot dark matter\" because they are expected to have high thermal velocities. The evidence supporting the hypothesis that dark matter is composed of dark radiation is mainly indirect and comes from various cosmological observations:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang. Observations of the CMB, particularly the temperature fluctuations, provide information about the composition of the universe. The presence of dark radiation could affect the CMB power spectrum, and some studies have suggested that there might be room for a small fraction of dark radiation in the universe. However, the current data from the Planck satellite does not provide strong evidence for the existence of dark radiation.\n\n2. Large-scale structure formation: Dark radiation could influence the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters. Hot dark matter particles would tend to smooth out density fluctuations, making it difficult for structures to form. Observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, however, suggest that dark matter is primarily composed of cold or warm particles, not hot dark matter like dark radiation.\n\n3. Neutrino oscillations: Neutrinos are known to oscillate between different flavors, which implies that they have mass. Some models of dark radiation propose that it consists of sterile neutrinos, which do not interact with other particles except through gravity. However, the current experimental limits on the mass and mixing of sterile neutrinos make it challenging for them to account for the majority of dark matter.\n\nCompared to other dark matter models, the dark radiation hypothesis faces some challenges. Observations of the CMB and large-scale structure formation seem to favor cold dark matter models, such as those involving WIMPs or axions. These particles are non-relativistic and would clump together more easily, allowing for the formation of the observed structures in the universe. Additionally, WIMPs and axions have well-motivated theoretical foundations in particle physics, making them attractive candidates for dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some indirect evidence that could support the hypothesis that dark matter is composed of dark radiation, current cosmological observations seem to favor cold dark matter models, such as those involving WIMPs or axions. Further research and observations, including more precise measurements of the CMB and large-scale structure, as well as direct detection experiments for dark matter particles, will help to clarify the nature of dark matter and potentially provide more evidence for or against the dark radiation hypothesis."
