    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released by a Type Ia supernova explosion, we first need to determine the luminosity of the supernova and the duration of the explosion. \n\nGiven that the luminosity of the supernova is 10^9 times that of the sun, we can use the sun's luminosity to find the supernova's luminosity. The sun's luminosity is approximately 3.8 x 10^26 watts. Therefore, the supernova's luminosity is:\n\nL_supernova = 10^9 * L_sun = 10^9 * (3.8 x 10^26 W) = 3.8 x 10^35 W\n\nNow, we need to determine the duration of the explosion. Type Ia supernovae typically have a peak luminosity duration of about 20 days. To convert this to seconds, we can use the following conversion:\n\n20 days * (24 hours/day) * (3600 seconds/hour) = 1,728,000 seconds\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy released during the explosion by multiplying the luminosity by the duration:\n\nE_total = L_supernova * duration = (3.8 x 10^35 W) * (1,728,000 s) = 6.57 x 10^41 Joules\n\nHowever, we are given that only 10% of the nuclear energy of fusion is converted into radiation. Therefore, we need to divide the total energy by the efficiency to find the actual energy released:\n\nE_actual = E_total / efficiency = (6.57 x 10^41 J) / 0.1 = 6.57 x 10^42 Joules\n\nSo, the total energy released by a Type Ia supernova explosion with a luminosity of 10^9 times that of the sun and an efficiency of 10% in converting the nuclear energy of fusion into radiation is approximately 6.57 x 10^42 Joules."
