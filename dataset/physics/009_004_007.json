    "message_1": "A glass block has a refractive index of 1.5. What is the critical angle for total internal reflection when the light passes from the glass to air?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, n1 is the refractive index of the glass (1.5) and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1). The critical angle occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees. So, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection when the light passes from the glass to air is approximately 41.81 degrees."
