    "message_1": "A rectangular block of wood with dimensions 0.3 m x 0.2 m x 0.15 m is floating in water. If the density of wood is 700 kg/m³, what is the mass of the block and how much water does it displace? (Density of water is 1000 kg/m³)",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of the block, we can use the formula:\n\nmass = density x volume\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the block:\n\nvolume = length x width x height\nvolume = 0.3 m x 0.2 m x 0.15 m\nvolume = 0.009 m³\n\nNow we can find the mass of the block:\n\nmass = density x volume\nmass = 700 kg/m³ x 0.009 m³\nmass = 6.3 kg\n\nSince the block is floating, the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the block. We can use the formula:\n\nweight = mass x gravity\nweight = 6.3 kg x 9.81 m/s²\nweight = 61.803 kg m/s² (or N, Newtons)\n\nNow we can find the volume of water displaced using the formula:\n\nvolume = weight / (density x gravity)\nvolume = 61.803 N / (1000 kg/m³ x 9.81 m/s²)\nvolume = 61.803 N / 9810 N/m³\nvolume ≈ 0.0063 m³\n\nSo, the mass of the block is 6.3 kg, and it displaces approximately 0.0063 m³ of water."
