    "message_2": "The likelihood of producing a W or Z boson through quark-antiquark annihilation can be quantified by their respective production cross-sections. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of a specific process occurring in a particle collision.\n\nThe production cross-sections for W and Z bosons depend on the coupling constants, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding particles, and the collision energy. The coupling constants for W and Z bosons are determined by the electroweak interaction, which is described by the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model.\n\nIn general, the production cross-section for W bosons is larger than that for Z bosons. This is because the W boson couples to both up-type and down-type quarks, while the Z boson couples only to up-type or down-type quarks. Additionally, the W boson has a smaller mass than the Z boson, which also contributes to the larger cross-section.\n\nAs the collision energy increases, the production cross-sections for both W and Z bosons increase. However, the rate of increase depends on the specific energy range and the parton distribution functions. At high energies, the production cross-sections for both W and Z bosons can be dominated by the contributions from the gluon-gluon fusion process, which is a higher-order process in the electroweak interaction.\n\nIn summary, the likelihood of producing a W boson through quark-antiquark annihilation is generally higher than that of producing a Z boson. The difference in likelihood depends on the collision energy and the parton distribution functions of the colliding particles. As the collision energy increases, the production cross-sections for both W and Z bosons increase, but the rate of increase depends on the specific energy range and the parton distribution functions."
