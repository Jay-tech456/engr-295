    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the plane of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately. Let's label the segments as follows:\n\n1. Bottom segment (length 10 cm)\n2. Right segment (length 8 cm)\n3. Top segment (length 10 cm)\n4. Left segment (length 8 cm)\n\nThe magnetic field due to segments 1 and 3 will cancel each other out because they have opposite directions. Similarly, the magnetic field due to segments 2 and 4 will also cancel each other out. Therefore, we only need to calculate the magnetic field due to one of the segments (e.g., segment 2) and multiply it by 2.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field due to segment 2. The length of segment 2 is 8 cm, and the distance from the point to the center of the segment is 5 cm. We can integrate the Biot-Savart law along the length of the segment:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³\n\nTo simplify the integration, we can use the following variables:\n\nx = distance along the segment (0 to 8 cm)\ny = distance from the plane of the loop (5 cm)\nz = distance perpendicular to the plane of the loop (0 cm)\n\nThe position vector r is given by:\n\nr = <x, y, z>\n\nThe differential length vector dl is given by:\n\ndl = <0, dx, 0>\n\nThe cross product dl x r is given by:\n\ndl x r = <-y dx, 0, x dx>\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law and integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(-y dx / (x² + y²)^(3/2), 0, x dx / (x² + y²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * ∫(-y dx / (x² + y²)^(3/2), 0, x dx / (x² + y²)^(3/2)))\n\nWe only need to calculate the z-component of the magnetic field, so we can focus on the third term:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(x dx / (x² + y²)^(3/2))\n\nNow we can plug in the values for I, y, and the limits of integration:\n\nBz = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * 2 A * ∫(x dx / (x² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2)) from x = 0 to x = 0.08 m\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * ∫(x dx / (x² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2)) from x = 0 to x = 0.08 m\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x² + 0.0025 m², then du = 2x dx:\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * ∫(du / u^(3/2)) from u = 0.0025 m² to u = 0.0064 m² + 0.0025 m²\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * ∫(u^(-3/2) du) from u = 0.0025 m² to u = 0.0089 m²\n\nNow we can integrate and evaluate the limits:\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * [-2u^(-1/2)] from u = 0.0025 m² to u = 0.0089 m²\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * [-2(0.0089 m²)^(-1/2) + 2(0.0025 m²)^(-1/2)]\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * [-2(0.1 m)^(-1) + 2(0.05 m)^(-1)]\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * [-20 + 40]\n\nBz = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * 20\n\nBz = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSince we only calculated the magnetic field due to segment 2, we need to multiply this value by 2 to account for the magnetic field due to segment 4:\n\nB_total = 2 * Bz = 2 * 2 × 10^(-6) T = 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the plane of the loop on the side where the current is anti-clockwise is 4 × 10^(-6) T."
