    "message_2": "To calculate the quantum Hall resistance per square, we need to determine the filling factor (ν) and then use the formula for the Hall resistance:\n\nR_H = h / (ν * e^2),\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), and ν is the filling factor.\n\nThe filling factor is given by the ratio of the electron density (n) to the magnetic flux density (B) divided by the magnetic flux quantum (Φ0):\n\nν = n * h / (e * B),\n\nwhere Φ0 = h / e ≈ 4.14 x 10^-15 Tm² is the magnetic flux quantum.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the electron density (n) in the sample. Therefore, we cannot calculate the quantum Hall resistance per square without this information."
