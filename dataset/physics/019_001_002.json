    "message_2": "To calculate the scattering amplitude for two electrons scattering off each other in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), we use perturbation theory, specifically, the Feynman diagrams. We will consider the process up to the first order, which is the simplest non-trivial case.\n\nThe process we are considering is e⁻(p₁) + e⁻(p₂) → e⁻(p₃) + e⁻(p₄), where p₁, p₂, p₃, and p₄ are the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing electrons.\n\nAt the first order, there are two Feynman diagrams contributing to the scattering amplitude: the t-channel and the u-channel. The t-channel diagram involves the exchange of a virtual photon between the two electrons, while the u-channel diagram involves the exchange of a virtual photon between the incoming electron and the outgoing electron.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for the t-channel is given by:\n\nM_t = (-ie)^2 u̅(p₃) γ^μ u(p₁) * (-g_μν / (q^2 + iε)) * u̅(p₄) γ^ν u(p₂),\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, γ^μ are the Dirac gamma matrices, u(p) and u̅(p) are the electron spinors, g_μν is the metric tensor, q = p₁ - p₃ is the momentum transfer, and ε is a small positive number to ensure the correct photon propagator behavior.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for the u-channel is given by:\n\nM_u = (-ie)^2 u̅(p₄) γ^μ u(p₁) * (-g_μν / (q'^2 + iε)) * u̅(p₃) γ^ν u(p₂),\n\nwhere q' = p₁ - p₄ is the momentum transfer for the u-channel.\n\nThe total scattering amplitude is the sum of the t-channel and u-channel amplitudes:\n\nM_total = M_t + M_u.\n\nTo obtain the differential cross-section, we need to square the scattering amplitude and average over the initial spins and sum over the final spins:\n\n| M_total |^2 = 1/4 Σ | M_t + M_u |^2,\n\nwhere the factor of 1/4 comes from averaging over the initial spins.\n\nFinally, to obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the final state phase space:\n\nσ = ∫ dΦ | M_total |^2.\n\nThis integral depends on the specific energy and scattering angle of the process. The result will give you the total cross-section for the two electrons scattering off each other at the given energy in QED up to the first order in perturbation theory."
