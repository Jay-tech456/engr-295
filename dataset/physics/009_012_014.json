    "message_1": "A physics student is given a converging lens with a focal length of 10 cm. The object is placed 5 cm in front of the lens. What is the location of the image produced by the lens and what is the magnification of the image?",
    "message_2": "To find the location of the image produced by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 10 cm, do = 5 cm\n\n1/10 = 1/5 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n1/10 = 2/10 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 2/10 from both sides:\n\n-1/10 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n-10 = di\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image. The image is located 10 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (M) of the image, we can use the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -(-10)/5\n\nM = 10/5\n\nM = 2\n\nThe magnification of the image is 2, which means the image is twice the size of the object."
