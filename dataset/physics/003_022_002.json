    "message_1": "A circular loop of wire carrying a current of 3 A is placed near a motor. The loop has a radius of 0.1 meters and the motor is 0.2 meters away from the loop's center. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current-carrying motor?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current-carrying motor, we need to know the current and distance from the motor to the center of the loop. However, the information provided only gives the distance between the motor and the loop's center, but not the current in the motor. \n\nPlease provide the current in the motor to calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop."
