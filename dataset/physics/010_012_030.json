    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer, we will use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * ν / U)^(1/2) * 5\n\nwhere:\nx is the distance from the leading edge of the plate to the point of interest,\nν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m^2/s),\nU is the free-stream velocity of the fluid (m/s), and\n5 is a constant from the Blasius solution.\n\nHowever, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν) first, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nwhere:\nμ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s), and\nρ is the density of the fluid (kg/m^3).\n\nWe are given the dynamic viscosity (μ) as 1.5 × 10^-5 Pa·s, but we do not have the density (ρ) of the fluid. Without the density, we cannot find the kinematic viscosity and thus cannot calculate the boundary layer thickness.\n\nIf you can provide the density of the fluid, we can proceed with the calculation."
