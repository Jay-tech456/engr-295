    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force acting on the object, we can use Stokes' Law for small spherical objects moving through a viscous fluid. Stokes' Law states:\n\nFd = 6πηrv\n\nwhere Fd is the drag force, η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, r is the radius of the sphere, and v is the terminal velocity of the sphere.\n\nGiven the diameter of the object is 5 cm, the radius (r) is 2.5 cm or 0.025 m. The viscosity (η) is given as 0.01 Pa·s, and the terminal velocity (v) is 0.3 m/s.\n\nFd = 6π(0.01 Pa·s)(0.025 m)(0.3 m/s)\nFd ≈ 0.0141 N\n\nThe drag force acting on the object is approximately 0.0141 N.\n\nNow, let's calculate the lift force acting on the object. The lift force can be determined using the buoyancy principle, which states that the buoyant force (or lift force) is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The buoyant force can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nFb = ρVg\n\nwhere Fb is the buoyant force, ρ is the density of the fluid, V is the volume of the object, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the object. Since the object is a sphere, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nV = (4/3)π(0.025 m)³\nV ≈ 6.54 × 10⁻⁵ m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the buoyant force:\n\nFb = (800 kg/m³)(6.54 × 10⁻⁵ m³)(9.81 m/s²)\nFb ≈ 0.0513 N\n\nThe lift force (or buoyant force) acting on the object is approximately 0.0513 N."
