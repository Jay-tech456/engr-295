    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy and momentum of the particle, we first need to determine its relativistic mass and then use the equations for energy and momentum.\n\n1. Calculate the relativistic mass:\nThe relativistic mass (m) can be found using the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nm = (2.5 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nm = (2.5 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm = (2.5 x 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.36)\nm = (2.5 x 10^-27 kg) / 0.6\nm ≈ 4.1667 x 10^-27 kg\n\n2. Calculate the relativistic momentum:\nThe relativistic momentum (p) can be found using the equation:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass and v is the velocity.\n\np = (4.1667 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.8c)\np ≈ 3.3333 x 10^-27 kg * c\n\n3. Calculate the relativistic energy:\nThe relativistic energy (E) can be found using the equation:\n\nE = m * c^2\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass and c is the speed of light.\n\nE = (4.1667 x 10^-27 kg) * c^2\nE ≈ 3.75 x 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the particle is approximately 3.75 x 10^-10 Joules, and the relativistic momentum is approximately 3.3333 x 10^-27 kg * c."
