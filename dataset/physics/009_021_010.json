    "message_1": "A polarized light beam with an intensity of 2.5 W/cm² passes through two polarizing filters. The first polarizing filter is aligned at 45° to the vertical and transmits 50% of the light intensity. The second filter is aligned at 90° to the first filter. What is the intensity of the light beam that emerges from the second filter?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the light beam that emerges from the second filter, we can use Malus's law. Malus's law states that the intensity of light transmitted through two polarizing filters is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axes of the filters.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the transmission axes of the filters is 90°. Therefore, the intensity of the light transmitted through the second filter can be calculated as follows:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the light transmitted through the second filter, I₀ is the intensity of the light transmitted through the first filter, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the filters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the intensity of the light transmitted through the first filter. Since the first filter transmits 50% of the light intensity, the intensity of the light transmitted through the first filter is:\n\nI₀ = 2.5 W/cm² * 0.5 = 1.25 W/cm²\n\nNow we can calculate the intensity of the light transmitted through the second filter:\n\nI = 1.25 W/cm² * cos²(90°)\nI = 1.25 W/cm² * (0)²\nI = 0 W/cm²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light beam that emerges from the second filter is 0 W/cm²."
