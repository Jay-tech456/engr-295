    "message_2": "The minimum mass of a primordial black hole (PBH) necessary for it to be a viable candidate for dark matter is not well-defined, as it depends on the specific model and assumptions made. However, it is generally believed that PBHs with masses between 10^(-8) and 10^(2) solar masses (M☉) could potentially contribute to the dark matter content of the universe.\n\nObservational evidence supporting the possibility of PBHs as dark matter candidates comes from several sources:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: PBHs can act as gravitational lenses, bending the light from background objects. Observations of microlensing events, such as those conducted by the MACHO, EROS, and OGLE projects, have placed constraints on the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of 10^(-7) to 1 M☉. While these constraints rule out PBHs as the dominant form of dark matter in this mass range, they do not exclude the possibility of a subdominant population.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The presence of PBHs during the early universe could have affected the CMB radiation. Current CMB data from the Planck satellite has placed constraints on the abundance of PBHs with masses between 10^(-4) and 10^4 M☉, but these constraints are not strong enough to rule out PBHs as a viable dark matter candidate.\n\n3. Gravitational waves: The merger of PBHs can produce gravitational waves, which can be detected by observatories such as LIGO and Virgo. Recent detections of gravitational waves from black hole mergers have opened up the possibility of constraining the PBH abundance in the mass range of 1 to 100 M☉. While current data does not provide definitive evidence for or against PBHs as dark matter candidates, future observations may help to refine these constraints.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass of a primordial black hole necessary for it to be a viable candidate for dark matter is not well-defined and depends on the specific model and assumptions. Observational evidence from gravitational lensing, CMB radiation, and gravitational waves provides constraints on the abundance of PBHs in various mass ranges but does not yet rule out their potential contribution to the dark matter content of the universe."
