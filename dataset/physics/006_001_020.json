    "message_2": "To calculate the energy levels and wavelengths of the transitions between them for an electron in a hydrogen atom, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Energy levels of hydrogen atom:\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\n2. Energy difference between two levels (ΔE):\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\n3. Wavelength of the emitted photon (using the energy difference and Planck's constant h = 4.135667696 × 10^(-15) eV·s and the speed of light c = 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s):\nλ = h × c / ΔE\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy levels for n = 1 (ground state) and n = 4 (excited state):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / 4^2 = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy difference between these two levels:\n\nΔE = E_4 - E_1 = -0.85 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 12.75 eV\n\nFinally, let's calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon:\n\nλ = (4.135667696 × 10^(-15) eV·s) × (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s) / 12.75 eV ≈ 9.724 × 10^(-8) m\n\nSo, the energy levels are -13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1) and -0.85 eV for the excited state (n=4). The wavelength of the transition between these two levels is approximately 9.724 × 10^(-8) m or 97.24 nm."
