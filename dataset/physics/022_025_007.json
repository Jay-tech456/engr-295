    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to account for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. Dark radiation, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of relativistic particles that could be a component of dark matter. It is called \"dark\" because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it difficult to detect directly.\n\nThere are several observational evidences in cosmology that support the possibility of dark matter being composed of dark radiation:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than what would be expected based on the visible mass distribution. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which could be dark matter composed of dark radiation.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, provides evidence for the existence of dark matter. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what would be expected based on the visible mass of these objects, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which could be dark matter composed of dark radiation.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The CMB power spectrum, which describes the distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB, is sensitive to the presence of dark radiation. The presence of dark radiation would affect the CMB power spectrum, and current observations are consistent with the possibility of dark radiation being a component of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter composed of dark radiation are able to reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the universe, providing further support for the possibility of dark matter being composed of dark radiation.\n\n5. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN): BBN is the process by which light elements, such as hydrogen and helium, were formed in the early universe. The abundance of these light elements is sensitive to the number of relativistic particles present during BBN. If dark radiation is a component of dark matter, it would contribute to the number of relativistic particles and affect the predicted abundances of light elements. Current observations of light element abundances are consistent with the possibility of dark radiation being a component of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while there is no direct observational evidence for dark matter being composed of dark radiation, several lines of indirect evidence from cosmology support this possibility. Further research and observations, such as those from future CMB experiments and large-scale structure surveys, will help to constrain the properties of dark matter and potentially reveal the nature of its constituents, including the possible presence of dark radiation."
