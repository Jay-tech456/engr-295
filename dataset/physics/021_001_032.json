    "message_2": "The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes and stellar black holes differ significantly due to their distinct origins, sizes, and behaviors. \n\nFormation:\n\n1. Stellar Black Holes:\nStellar black holes form from the collapse of massive stars. When a star with a mass greater than approximately three times the mass of our Sun reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a supernova explosion. The core of the star collapses under its own gravity, and if the remaining mass is large enough, it forms a black hole. This process is known as core-collapse supernova.\n\n2. Supermassive Black Holes:\nThe formation of supermassive black holes is not yet fully understood, but there are several proposed mechanisms. One possibility is that they form from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, bypassing the stage of being a star. Another possibility is that they form through the mergers of multiple stellar black holes or intermediate-mass black holes. A third possibility is that they grow over time by accreting mass from their surroundings, including gas, dust, and other celestial objects.\n\nSizes and Behaviors:\n\n1. Stellar Black Holes:\nStellar black holes typically have masses between 3 and 20 solar masses. Due to their relatively small size, they have a strong tidal force near their event horizon, which can cause the spaghettification of objects that come too close. Stellar black holes can also emit X-rays when they accrete matter from a companion star, forming an X-ray binary system.\n\n2. Supermassive Black Holes:\nSupermassive black holes have masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. They are usually found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Due to their immense mass, the tidal forces near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole are weaker than those near a stellar black hole, meaning that objects can get closer to the event horizon without being torn apart. Supermassive black holes can also emit enormous amounts of energy in the form of radiation and relativistic jets when they accrete matter, which can have a significant impact on the evolution of their host galaxies.\n\nIn summary, the formation of stellar black holes is relatively well-understood and occurs through the collapse of massive stars, while the formation of supermassive black holes is still a subject of ongoing research and may involve several different mechanisms. Stellar black holes are much smaller in size and mass compared to supermassive black holes, which leads to differences in their behaviors, such as tidal forces and energy emissions."
