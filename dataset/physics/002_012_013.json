    "message_1": "A system undergoes an isothermal process while absorbing 1500 J of heat from its surroundings. If the system's initial volume is 0.5 m³ and its final volume is 0.8 m³, calculate the work done by the system during the process. Assume the temperature remains constant at 300 K throughout the process.",
    "message_2": "In an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant. The work done by the system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nHowever, we are not given the number of moles (n) in the problem. We can use the first law of thermodynamics to relate the heat absorbed (Q) to the work done (W) and the change in internal energy (∆U):\n\nQ = ∆U + W\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the change in internal energy is zero (∆U = 0). Therefore, the heat absorbed is equal to the work done:\n\nQ = W\n\nWe are given that the system absorbs 1500 J of heat:\n\n1500 J = W\n\nSo, the work done by the system during the process is 1500 J."
