    "message_2": "To calculate the expected change in the orbital period of a binary star system due to the emission of gravitational waves, we can use the following formula derived from the general relativity:\n\nΔP/P = -(96π/5) * (G²/c⁵) * (M₁M₂(M₁+M₂)) * (a/Rₒ)⁴ * Δt\n\nwhere:\n- ΔP is the change in the orbital period\n- P is the initial orbital period\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n- M₁ and M₂ are the masses of the two stars in the binary system\n- a is the semi-major axis of the binary system\n- Rₒ is the initial orbital separation\n- Δt is the time over which the change in the orbital period is being considered\n\nLet's assume we have a binary star system with the following properties:\n- M₁ = 1.4 solar masses (M₁ = 1.4 × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg)\n- M₂ = 1.0 solar masses (M₂ = 1.0 × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg)\n- a = 10 million kilometers (a = 10 × 10⁶ × 10³ m)\n- Rₒ = 20 million kilometers (Rₒ = 20 × 10⁶ × 10³ m)\n- P = 1 day (P = 1 × 24 × 3600 s)\n- Δt = 1 year (Δt = 1 × 365.25 × 24 × 3600 s)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔP/P = -(96π/5) * (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)² * (1.4 × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg * 1.0 × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg * (1.4 + 1.0) × 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg) * (10 × 10⁶ × 10³ m / 20 × 10⁶ × 10³ m)⁴ * (1 × 365.25 × 24 × 3600 s)\n\nΔP/P ≈ -1.16 × 10⁻¹²\n\nTo find the change in the orbital period (ΔP), we can multiply this value by the initial orbital period (P):\n\nΔP = ΔP/P * P ≈ -1.16 × 10⁻¹² * 1 × 24 × 3600 s ≈ -3.66 × 10⁻⁸ s\n\nSo, the expected change in the orbital period of this binary star system due to the emission of gravitational waves over a period of 1 year is approximately -3.66 × 10⁻⁸ seconds. This means that the orbital period will decrease by this amount, causing the binary system to gradually spiral inwards."
