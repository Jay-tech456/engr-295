    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Ampere's law and the Biot-Savart law. Ampere's law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop. The Biot-Savart law relates the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire to the distance from the wire.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field produced by a single turn of the helix at the given point. The radius of the helix (r) is half of its diameter, so r = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m. The distance (x) from the center of the helix to the point along its axis is 3 cm = 0.03 m.\n\nFor a single turn of the helix, the magnetic field at the given point can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB_single_turn = (μ₀ * I * r^2) / (2 * (r^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (4 A), r is the radius of the helix (0.025 m), and x is the distance from the center of the helix (0.03 m).\n\nB_single_turn = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * (0.025 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.025 m)^2 + (0.03 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field produced by all 20 turns of the helix. Since the magnetic field is directly proportional to the number of turns, we can simply multiply the magnetic field of a single turn by the number of turns (N):\n\nB_total = N * B_single_turn\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nB_total = 20 * B_single_turn\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\nB_single_turn ≈ (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A * (0.025 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.025 m)^2 + (0.03 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB_single_turn ≈ 1.07 × 10^(-5) T\n\nB_total = 20 * 1.07 × 10^(-5) T\nB_total ≈ 2.14 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 3 cm from the center of the helix, along its axis, is approximately 2.14 × 10^(-4) T."
