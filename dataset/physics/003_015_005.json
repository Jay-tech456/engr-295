    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the square and multiply the result by 4.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The current flows along the side, and we can divide the side into small segments (dl). The position vector (r) for each segment will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop and have a magnitude equal to half the side length (0.05 m).\n\nFor each segment, the angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the side of the square loop:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * ∫dl\n\nThe integral of dl along the side is equal to the side length (0.1 m):\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r) / r³ * 0.1\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB_side = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * 0.05 m) / (0.05 m)³ * 0.1 m\nB_side = (10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (0.1 A m) / (0.000125 m²) * 0.1 m\n\nB_side ≈ 8 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\nB_total ≈ 4 * 8 × 10⁻⁶ T\nB_total ≈ 32 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 32 μT."
