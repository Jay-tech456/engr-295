    "message_1": "A Carnot engine operates between two heat reservoirs, one at a temperature of 500 K and the other at a temperature of 300 K. The engine performs 1000 J of work during each cycle. What is the efficiency of the Carnot engine?",
    "message_2": "The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 500 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K)\nEfficiency = 1 - 0.6\nEfficiency = 0.4\n\nSo, the efficiency of the Carnot engine is 40%."
