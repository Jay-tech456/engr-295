    "message_2": "In a single Rydberg atom, the maximum number of qubits that can be stored without causing significant decoherence for the purpose of quantum computing is typically one. A Rydberg atom is an atom with one or more electrons in a highly excited state, which makes it highly sensitive to external perturbations. This sensitivity can be exploited to create strong interactions between qubits, which is useful for quantum computing.\n\nHowever, storing multiple qubits in a single Rydberg atom is challenging due to the limited number of available energy levels and the increased likelihood of decoherence as more qubits are added. In practice, researchers often use arrays of Rydberg atoms, where each atom stores a single qubit, to build scalable quantum computing systems. By carefully controlling the interactions between these Rydberg atoms, it is possible to perform quantum operations and maintain coherence across multiple qubits."
