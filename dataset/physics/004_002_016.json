    "message_1": "What is the maximum possible mass a black hole can have, given that it is formed from a star with an initial mass of 100 times that of our sun, and what is the radius of its event horizon?",
    "message_2": "When a massive star collapses to form a black hole, not all of its mass ends up in the black hole. Some of the mass is lost due to various processes such as stellar winds and supernova explosions. For a star with an initial mass of 100 times that of our Sun, it is estimated that around 50% of its mass could be lost during its lifetime.\n\nAssuming the most optimistic scenario, let's say that 50 solar masses end up in the black hole. The mass of our Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole would be:\n\nM = 50 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 9.945 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere R is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nR = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nR â‰ˆ 1.475 x 10^5 km\n\nSo, the maximum possible mass of a black hole formed from a star with an initial mass of 100 times that of our Sun is approximately 9.945 x 10^31 kg, and the radius of its event horizon is approximately 147,500 km."
