    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of aluminum, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Mass (m) = 20 grams\n- Heat energy absorbed (Q) = 456 joules\n- Initial temperature (T1) = 25°C\n- Final temperature (T2) = 45°C\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 45°C - 25°C = 20°C\n\nNow we can rearrange the formula to find the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 456 J / (20 g × 20°C) = 456 J / 400 g°C = 1.14 J/g°C\n\nSo, the heat capacity of the 20 grams of aluminum is 1.14 J/g°C."
