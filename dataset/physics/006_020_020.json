    "message_2": "To calculate the Mott scattering cross section, we can use the Mott formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (4 * E₀ * sin²(θ/2)))² * (1 - β² * sin²(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- dσ/dΩ is the differential cross section\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the projectile and target atoms, respectively\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)\n- E₀ is the kinetic energy of the projectile\n- θ is the scattering angle\n- β is the ratio of the projectile's velocity to the speed of light\n\nFirst, let's find the value of β. We can use the following formula to find the velocity of the alpha particle:\n\nE₀ = (1/2) * m * v²\n\nwhere m is the mass of the alpha particle. Since an alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, its mass is approximately 4 times the mass of a proton (m_p = 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg):\n\nm = 4 * m_p = 4 * 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg = 6.68 × 10^(-27) kg\n\nNow we can solve for v:\n\nv² = 2 * E₀ / m\nv = sqrt(2 * E₀ / m)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 3.5 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV / 6.68 × 10^(-27) kg)\nv ≈ 1.22 × 10^7 m/s\n\nNow we can find β:\n\nβ = v / c\nβ ≈ 1.22 × 10^7 m/s / 3 × 10^8 m/s\nβ ≈ 0.0407\n\nNow we can calculate the Mott scattering cross section:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e² / (4 * E₀ * sin²(θ/2)))² * (1 - β² * sin²(θ/2))\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (2 * 16 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)² / (4 * 3.5 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV * sin²(60/2)))² * (1 - 0.0407² * sin²(60/2))\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (32 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)² / (14 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV * 0.75))² * (1 - 0.0407² * 0.75)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (32 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)² / (14 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV * 0.75))² * (1 - 0.00166)\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (32 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)² / (14 × 10^6 eV * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV * 0.75))² * 0.99834\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (1.63 × 10^(-30) m²) * 0.99834\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 1.63 × 10^(-30) m²\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for the given conditions is approximately 1.63 × 10^(-30) m²."
