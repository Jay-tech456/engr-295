    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm away from the center of the cylinder, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nIn this case, we will consider a circular loop of radius 10 cm (0.1 m) centered at the axis of the cylinder. Since the copper wire is wrapped around the cylindrical core, the magnetic field will be in the form of concentric circles around the axis.\n\nLet's first calculate the total current enclosed by the loop. The current in the copper wire is 5 A, and since the wire is wrapped around the core, the total current enclosed by the loop is also 5 A.\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nHere, B is the magnetic field, dl is the infinitesimal length along the circular loop, and I is the total current enclosed by the loop. Since the magnetic field is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe closed line integral of dl along the circular loop is equal to the circumference of the loop:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nWe know the values of I (5 A) and r (0.1 m). The permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 5 A) / (2π × 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = 1 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm away from the center of the cylinder is 1 × 10^(-6) T or 1 μT."
