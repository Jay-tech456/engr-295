    "message_2": "Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as merging neutron stars or black holes. When two neutron stars orbit each other, they lose energy in the form of gravitational waves, which causes their orbits to shrink and eventually leads to a merger.\n\nThe effect of the radiation emitted by gravitational waves on a neutron star's mass and spin can be understood in two stages: during the inspiral phase and during the merger.\n\n1. Inspiral phase: As the neutron stars orbit each other and emit gravitational waves, they lose energy and angular momentum. This causes their orbits to shrink, and the stars to move closer together. The loss of mass due to gravitational wave emission is typically very small compared to the total mass of the neutron stars. The change in spin during this phase depends on the initial spin of the neutron stars and their orbital dynamics. In general, the spin of the neutron stars can be affected by the exchange of angular momentum with the orbit, causing them to spin up or down depending on the specific configuration.\n\n2. Merger: When the neutron stars finally merge, a significant fraction of their mass can be ejected in the form of a kilonova, powered by the decay of heavy elements produced in the merger. This mass ejection can lead to a decrease in the total mass of the system. Additionally, the merger can produce a rapidly spinning, highly deformed object, which can emit a burst of gravitational waves known as a post-merger signal. This emission can further reduce the mass and angular momentum of the system.\n\nIn summary, the radiation emitted by gravitational waves can have a small effect on a neutron star's mass and a more significant effect on its spin during the inspiral phase. The merger itself can lead to a more substantial decrease in mass and a change in the spin of the resulting object. However, the exact effect on the mass and spin depends on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbital configuration."
