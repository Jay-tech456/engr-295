    "message_2": "Sterile neutrino dark matter particles are hypothetical particles that do not interact with the Standard Model particles through the known fundamental forces, except for gravity. They are considered as one of the possible candidates for dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nThe estimated range of masses for sterile neutrino dark matter particles is based on their proposed decay signals in X-ray observations of galaxy clusters. These decay signals are expected to be produced when sterile neutrinos decay into active neutrinos and photons. The mass range for sterile neutrinos is typically constrained between a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to a few MeV (mega-electron volts), with the most favored mass range being around 1-10 keV.\n\nThis mass range is quite different from other proposed dark matter candidates, such as:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates and are expected to have masses in the range of 10 GeV (giga-electron volts) to a few TeV (tera-electron volts). They are much heavier than sterile neutrinos and interact through the weak nuclear force.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are expected to have extremely low masses, in the range of 10^(-6) eV (micro-electron volts) to 10^(-3) eV (milli-electron volts). Axions are much lighter than sterile neutrinos and interact very weakly with other particles.\n\n3. Primordial black holes: Primordial black holes are another proposed dark matter candidate, formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. Their masses can range from very small (sub-atomic) to several solar masses, making them quite different from sterile neutrinos in terms of mass and formation mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, the estimated mass range for sterile neutrino dark matter particles is around 1-10 keV, based on their proposed decay signals in X-ray observations of galaxy clusters. This mass range is distinct from other dark matter candidates such as WIMPs, axions, and primordial black holes, making sterile neutrinos an interesting and unique candidate for dark matter."
