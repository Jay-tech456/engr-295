    "message_2": "To calculate the deflection of light due to gravitational lensing around a massive object, we can use the formula for the deflection angle (α) in the context of general relativity:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- α is the deflection angle\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the massive object (in kg)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance between the light ray and the massive object (in meters)\n\nTo predict the amount of deflection, we need to know the mass of the massive object (M) and the impact parameter (b). Once we have these values, we can plug them into the formula and calculate the deflection angle α.\n\nKeep in mind that this formula assumes that the massive object is not moving, and the light ray is passing close to it. In more complex scenarios, such as when the massive object is part of a galaxy cluster or when the light is coming from a distant source, the calculation may require more advanced techniques and numerical simulations."
