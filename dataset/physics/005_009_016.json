    "message_2": "To find the change in frequency of light emitted from a star moving away from Earth, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect equation. The equation is:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_emitted is the emitted frequency, v is the velocity of the star relative to Earth, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the star is moving away from Earth at a speed of 0.5c and the emitted frequency is 500 nm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nf_observed = (500 nm) * sqrt((1 - 0.5c/c) / (1 + 0.5c/c))\n\nf_observed = (500 nm) * sqrt((1 - 0.5) / (1 + 0.5))\n\nf_observed = (500 nm) * sqrt(0.5 / 1.5)\n\nf_observed = (500 nm) * sqrt(1/3)\n\nf_observed ≈ 500 nm * 0.577\n\nf_observed ≈ 288.7 nm\n\nNow, to find the change in frequency, we can subtract the emitted frequency from the observed frequency:\n\nChange in frequency = f_observed - f_emitted\n\nChange in frequency = 288.7 nm - 500 nm\n\nChange in frequency ≈ -211.3 nm\n\nSo, the change in frequency of light emitted from the star moving away from Earth at a speed of 0.5c is approximately -211.3 nm. This negative value indicates that the observed frequency is lower (redshifted) compared to the emitted frequency due to the star moving away from Earth."
