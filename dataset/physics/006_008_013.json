    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of a photon needed to eject an electron with a kinetic energy of 6 eV from a sodium atom in the photoelectric effect, we need to consider the work function of sodium. The work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material.\n\nThe work function of sodium is approximately 2.28 eV. According to the photoelectric effect, the energy of the incoming photon must be equal to the sum of the work function and the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.\n\nPhoton energy = Work function + Kinetic energy\nPhoton energy = 2.28 eV + 6 eV\nPhoton energy = 8.28 eV\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon needed to eject an electron with a kinetic energy of 6 eV from a sodium atom is 8.28 eV."
