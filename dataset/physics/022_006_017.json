    "message_2": "The gravitational effect of dark matter on the rotation curves of galaxies is significant and has a substantial impact on the distribution of normal matter within these galaxies.\n\nIn the 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin observed that the rotation curves of galaxies did not follow the expected pattern based on the distribution of visible matter alone. According to Newtonian dynamics, the rotation speed of stars and gas in a galaxy should decrease as we move away from the galactic center, since the gravitational force exerted by the visible matter decreases with distance. However, Rubin's observations showed that the rotation speed remained roughly constant or even increased slightly at larger distances from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the observed and expected rotation curves became known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nDark matter, a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible, was proposed as a solution to this problem. The presence of dark matter in and around galaxies would provide additional gravitational force, causing the observed flat or slightly rising rotation curves. The total mass of dark matter in a galaxy is estimated to be several times greater than the mass of visible matter, which means that dark matter plays a crucial role in shaping the overall gravitational potential of a galaxy.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter within a galaxy is thought to form a roughly spherical halo that extends well beyond the visible disk. This halo of dark matter influences the distribution of normal matter (stars, gas, and dust) within the galaxy. The gravitational force exerted by the dark matter halo helps to stabilize the galaxy and maintain its structure, preventing the visible matter from dispersing or collapsing under its own gravity.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of dark matter affects the formation and evolution of galaxies. The gravitational pull of dark matter can cause gas to accumulate in certain regions, leading to the formation of stars and the growth of galaxies. Dark matter also plays a role in the interactions between galaxies, such as mergers and collisions, which can significantly alter the distribution of normal matter within the galaxies involved.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational effect of dark matter on the rotation curves of galaxies is essential for explaining the observed behavior of these systems, and it has a significant impact on the distribution and evolution of normal matter within galaxies."
