    "message_2": "To find the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer:\n\nI_t = I_0 * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_0 is the intensity of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the intensity of the transmitted light is 50% of the incident intensity, so:\n\n0.5 * I_0 = I_0 * cos^2(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I_0:\n\n0.5 = cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1/sqrt(2):\n\nθ = arccos(1/sqrt(2))\n\nθ ≈ 45°\n\nSo, the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer is approximately 45°."
