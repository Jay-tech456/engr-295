    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Ideal Gas Law equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial volume (V1) of the gas using the given information:\n\nP1 = 10 atm\nn = 100 moles\nR = 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) (ideal gas constant)\nT1 = 300 K\n\n10 atm * V1 = 100 moles * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 300 K\n\nNow, we can solve for V1:\n\nV1 = (100 * 0.0821 * 300) / 10\nV1 = 2463 L\n\nNow, we are given that the final volume (V2) is half of the initial volume:\n\nV2 = 0.5 * V1\nV2 = 0.5 * 2463 L\nV2 = 1231.5 L\n\nWe need to find the final temperature (T2) when the volume is half of its initial volume. We can assume that the pressure and the number of moles remain constant. So, we can use the combined gas law equation:\n\n(P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2\n\nSince the pressure remains constant, P1 = P2. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(V1 / T1) = (V2 / T2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for T2:\n\n(2463 L / 300 K) = (1231.5 L / T2)\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nT2 = (1231.5 L * 300 K) / 2463 L\nT2 = 150 K\n\nSo, the temperature at which the volume of the gas would become half of its initial volume is 150 Kelvin."
