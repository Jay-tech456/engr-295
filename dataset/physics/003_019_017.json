    "message_1": "A coaxial cable of length 3m consists of an inner conductor with a radius of 1mm and current of 2A, and an outer conductor with a radius of 5mm. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the inner conductor.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the inner conductor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nIn this case, we are considering a cylindrical loop with a radius of 2mm (0.002m) centered on the inner conductor. Since the loop is concentric with the inner conductor, the magnetic field (B) will be constant along the loop, and the direction of the magnetic field will be tangential to the loop. Therefore, the line integral of B can be simplified as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the loop (0.002m).\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the loop is inside the coaxial cable and only encloses the inner conductor, the enclosed current is equal to the current in the inner conductor (2A).\n\nNow we can set up the equation using Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe know the values of r (0.002m) and I_enclosed (2A), and the permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB * 2π(0.002) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 2\n\nNow we can solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2) / (2π * 0.002)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2) / (4π * 10^(-3))\n\nB = 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the inner conductor is 10^(-4) Tesla."
