    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification for a convex mirror, we can use the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nFor a convex mirror, the focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (R) and is positive:\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe object distance (do) is given as 30 cm. Now we can solve for the image distance (di):\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first subtract 1/30 from both sides:\n\n1/10 - 1/30 = 1/di\n\nNow find a common denominator (30) and simplify:\n\n(3 - 1) / 30 = 1/di\n2/30 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is 15 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -15 cm / 30 cm = -0.5\n\nThe magnification is -0.5, which means the image is reduced in size (0.5 times the object size) and is virtual and upright (indicated by the negative sign)."
