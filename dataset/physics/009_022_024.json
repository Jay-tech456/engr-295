    "message_2": "To find the angle of incidence at which there is no reflected light when polarized light is incident on a glass surface, we need to use Brewster's angle formula. Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence at which the reflected light is completely polarized parallel to the surface, and the reflected light intensity becomes zero for light polarized perpendicular to the surface.\n\nBrewster's angle formula is given by:\n\nθ_B = arctan(n2/n1)\n\nwhere θ_B is Brewster's angle, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (air in this case, with n1 = 1), and n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium (glass in this case, with n2 = 1.5).\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.5/1)\nθ_B = arctan(1.5)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle in degrees:\n\nθ_B ≈ 56.31°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence at which there is no reflected light when polarized light is incident on a glass surface with an index of refraction of 1.5 is approximately 56.31°."
