    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it is believed to make up about 85% of the total matter in the universe and has a significant gravitational influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.\n\nEvidence for dark matter comes from various observations, such as the rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. These observations indicate that there is more mass present in the universe than can be accounted for by visible matter alone.\n\nThe physical processes involved in the gravitational collapse of dark matter halos and the subsequent formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Initial density fluctuations: In the early universe, there were small density fluctuations in the distribution of both dark and visible matter. These fluctuations were likely caused by quantum fluctuations during the inflationary epoch, which were then amplified by cosmic expansion.\n\n2. Gravitational collapse: The regions with higher density of dark matter began to collapse under their own gravity, forming dark matter halos. Due to its weak interaction with other forces, dark matter only interacts gravitationally, allowing it to collapse more efficiently than visible matter, which is subject to other forces such as radiation pressure.\n\n3. Formation of dark matter halos: As the dark matter collapsed, it formed structures called dark matter halos. These halos are not uniform but have a density profile that decreases with distance from the center. The presence of these halos provided the gravitational potential wells necessary for the visible matter to fall into and accumulate.\n\n4. Gas cooling and condensation: The visible matter, primarily in the form of hydrogen and helium gas, fell into the dark matter halos' gravitational potential wells. As the gas cooled and condensed, it formed rotating disks, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies.\n\n5. Galaxy formation: Within the dark matter halos, the visible matter continued to collapse and form stars. These stars then grouped together to form galaxies. The dark matter halos provided the gravitational scaffolding for the galaxies to form and evolve.\n\n6. Galaxy cluster formation: Over time, the gravitational attraction between galaxies and their associated dark matter halos caused them to merge and form larger structures, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter is essential for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. It provides the necessary gravitational influence to initiate the collapse of matter and the formation of dark matter halos, which in turn serve as the foundation for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The evidence supporting the existence of dark matter and its role in cosmic structure formation comes from various astronomical observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation."
