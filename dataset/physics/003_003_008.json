    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field intensity at a point on the axis of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nIn this case, we have a toroid with a radius R = 10 cm, N = 50 turns of wire, and a current I = 2 A. We want to find the magnetic field intensity at a point on the axis of the toroid at a distance r = 5 cm from the center of the toroid.\n\nFirst, let's consider a circular Amperian loop of radius r (5 cm) centered at the axis of the toroid. The magnetic field is tangent to this loop, and its magnitude is the same at every point on the loop.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we have:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the Amperian loop, we can write:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nThe left side of the equation represents the total magnetic field along the loop, which is equal to the magnetic field intensity (B) multiplied by the circumference of the loop (2πr):\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we need to find the total current enclosed by the Amperian loop. Since the loop is inside the toroid, it encloses a fraction of the total current. The fraction of the current enclosed by the loop is equal to the ratio of the area of the loop to the total area of the toroid:\n\nFraction of current enclosed = (πr²) / (πR²)\n\nThe total current enclosed by the loop is then:\n\nI_enclosed = Fraction of current enclosed * I_total\nI_enclosed = (πr²) / (πR²) * N * I\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for I_enclosed back into Ampere's Law equation:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * ((πr²) / (πR²) * N * I)\n\nWe can now solve for the magnetic field intensity (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I * r) / (2πR²)\n\nPlugging in the values for the toroid and the point of interest:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 50 turns * 2 A * 0.05 m) / (2π * (0.1 m)²)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 100 A * 0.05 m) / (0.02π m²)\n\nB ≈ (20 × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (0.02 m²)\nB ≈ 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field intensity at a point on the axis of the toroid at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
