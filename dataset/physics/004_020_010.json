    "message_2": "To determine the expected time period of the gravitational waves produced by a binary star system consisting of two neutron stars, we need to know the orbital period of the system. The orbital period depends on the separation between the two stars and their masses. However, without the information about the separation between the two neutron stars, we can only provide a general idea of the expected time period of the gravitational waves.\n\nGravitational waves from a binary system are characterized by their frequency, which is twice the orbital frequency of the system. The orbital frequency (f_orb) can be related to the total mass (M) of the system and the separation (a) between the two stars using Kepler's third law:\n\nf_orb = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * M / a^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves (f_GW) is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orb\n\nTo find the time period (T) of the gravitational waves, we can take the reciprocal of the frequency:\n\nT = 1 / f_GW\n\nWithout the separation between the two neutron stars, we cannot provide a specific value for the expected time period of the gravitational waves. However, as the neutron stars get closer to each other and their orbital period decreases, the frequency of the gravitational waves will increase, and the time period will decrease. This process will continue until the neutron stars eventually merge, producing a final burst of gravitational waves."
