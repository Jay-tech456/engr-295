    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nA particle of rest mass 3 GeV/c^2 and kinetic energy 2 GeV decays into two daughter particles, one of which is at rest. What is the rest mass of the other daughter particle in this decay?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the moving daughter particle as particle A and the particle at rest as particle B.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total energy of the parent particle. The total energy E is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy:\n\nE = mc^2 + K\nE = (3 GeV/c^2)c^2 + 2 GeV\nE = 3 GeV + 2 GeV\nE = 5 GeV\n\nNow, let's find the momentum of the parent particle. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere m is the rest mass, p is the momentum, and c is the speed of light. We can rearrange the equation to solve for momentum:\n\n(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n(pc)^2 = (5 GeV)^2 - (3 GeV)^2\n(pc)^2 = 25 GeV^2 - 9 GeV^2\n(pc)^2 = 16 GeV^2\n\nTake the square root:\n\npc = 4 GeV\n\nNow, we can apply the conservation of energy and momentum to the decay process:\n\nE_parent = E_A + E_B\n5 GeV = E_A + m_Bc^2\n\np_parent = p_A + p_B\n4 GeV = p_A\n\nSince particle B is at rest, its momentum is 0, and the momentum of particle A is equal to the momentum of the parent particle:\n\np_A = 4 GeV\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum relation for particle A:\n\nE_A^2 = (m_Ac^2)^2 + (p_Ac)^2\n\nWe know E_A and p_A, so we can solve for m_A:\n\nE_A^2 = (m_Ac^2)^2 + (4 GeV)^2\n\nSubstitute E_A from the energy conservation equation:\n\n(5 GeV - m_Bc^2)^2 = (m_Ac^2)^2 + (4 GeV)^2\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of mass in the decay process:\n\nm_parent = m_A + m_B\n3 GeV/c^2 = m_A + m_B\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for m_A:\n\nm_A = 3 GeV/c^2 - m_B\n\nNow, substitute m_A in the energy-momentum equation:\n\n(5 GeV - m_Bc^2)^2 = ((3 GeV/c^2 - m_B)c^2)^2 + (4 GeV)^2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(5 GeV - m_Bc^2)^2 = (3 GeV - m_Bc^2)^2 + (4 GeV)^2\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n25 GeV^2 - 10 GeV^2m_B + m_B^2c^4 = 9 GeV^2 - 6 GeV^2m_B + m_B^2c^4 + 16 GeV^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nm_B^2c^4 - 4 GeV^2m_B = 0\n\nFactor out m_Bc^2:\n\nm_Bc^2(m_Bc^2 - 4 GeV^2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for m_B:\n\nm_Bc^2 = 0 or m_Bc^2 = 4 GeV^2\n\nSince m_B cannot be 0 (a particle must have a non-zero rest mass), we have:\n\nm_Bc^2 = 4 GeV^2\n\nDivide by c^2:\n\nm_B = 4 GeV/c^2\n\nSo, the rest mass of the other daughter particle (particle B) is 4 GeV/c^2."
