If the angle of incidence of the light is 30 degrees and the refractive index of water is 1.33, what is the angle of refraction of the light as it passes through the water from the fish to the student's eyes? Use Snell's Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, the angle of incidence (θ1) is 30 degrees, the refractive index of the first medium (air) is approximately 1, and the refractive index of the second medium (water) is 1.33. We want to find the angle of refraction (θ2).\n\nUsing Snell's Law:\n\n1 * sin(30°) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.33\n\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.376\n\nTo find the angle of refraction, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.376:\n\nθ2 ≈ arcsin(0.376)\n\nθ2 ≈ 22.1°\n\nTherefore, the angle of refraction of the light as it passes through the water from the fish to the student's eyes is approximately 22.1 degrees."
