    "message_2": "The ratio of dark matter to visible (or baryonic) matter in the universe is approximately 5:1. This means that for every unit of visible matter, there are about five units of dark matter. This ratio is derived from various observations and measurements, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy rotation curves, and gravitational lensing.\n\nThis ratio has significant implications for the observation of large-scale structures in the universe. Dark matter, although not directly observable, plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of these structures. Since dark matter interacts only through gravity and not through electromagnetic forces, it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its gravitational influence can be observed through its effects on visible matter and light.\n\nDark matter acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The presence of dark matter helps to explain the observed distribution of galaxies in the universe, as well as the motion of stars within galaxies. Without dark matter, the visible matter alone would not have enough mass to create the gravitational forces needed to form and maintain the large-scale structures we observe.\n\nFurthermore, dark matter affects the observation of large-scale structures through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. When light from distant galaxies passes through a region of space containing dark matter, the gravitational pull of the dark matter bends the path of the light, causing the images of the background galaxies to be distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged. By studying these gravitational lensing effects, astronomers can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the ratio of dark matter to visible matter in the universe is approximately 5:1, and this ratio plays a crucial role in the formation, evolution, and observation of large-scale structures in the universe. Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, and its presence can be inferred through gravitational lensing effects on light from distant galaxies."
