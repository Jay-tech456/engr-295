    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of the solid crystal, we can use the following formula:\n\nThermal conductivity (k) = (1/3) * C * v * λ\n\nwhere C is the specific heat capacity per unit volume, v is the speed of sound in the crystal, and λ is the phonon mean free path.\n\nFirst, we need to find the specific heat capacity per unit volume (C). We are given the specific heat capacity per unit mass (0.5 J/g.K) and the density (8 g/cm^3). We can find C by multiplying the specific heat capacity per unit mass by the density:\n\nC = (0.5 J/g.K) * (8 g/cm^3) = 4 J/cm^3.K\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of sound in the crystal (v). We can use the Debye model to estimate the speed of sound:\n\nv = (6π^2 * n)^(1/3) * a / (2π)\n\nwhere n is the number of atoms per unit cell and a is the lattice constant. For a face-centered cubic lattice, n = 4. The lattice constant is given as 4.2 Å, which is equivalent to 0.42 nm.\n\nv = (6π^2 * 4)^(1/3) * 0.42 nm / (2π) ≈ 0.42 nm * 1.336 / (2π) ≈ 0.089 nm/ps\n\nNow we can calculate the thermal conductivity (k) using the formula:\n\nk = (1/3) * C * v * λ\n\nThe phonon mean free path (λ) is given as 50 nm. We need to convert the specific heat capacity per unit volume (C) and the speed of sound (v) to consistent units. Since λ is given in nm, we will convert C to J/nm^3.K and v to nm/ps.\n\nC = 4 J/cm^3.K * (1 cm / 10^7 nm)^3 = 4 * 10^-21 J/nm^3.K\nv = 0.089 nm/ps\n\nNow we can calculate the thermal conductivity:\n\nk = (1/3) * (4 * 10^-21 J/nm^3.K) * (0.089 nm/ps) * (50 nm) ≈ 5.96 * 10^-22 J/ps.K\n\nTo convert the thermal conductivity to more common units, we can use the following conversion factors:\n\n1 J/ps.K = 10^12 W/m.K\n\nk = 5.96 * 10^-22 J/ps.K * 10^12 W/m.K = 5.96 * 10^-10 W/m.K\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the solid crystal at 300 K is approximately 5.96 * 10^-10 W/m.K."
