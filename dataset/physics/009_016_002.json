    "message_1": "A single-slit diffraction pattern is formed on a screen placed 1 meter away from the slit using monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm. The slit width is 0.2 mm. If a second slit is made next to the first one, what should be the minimum distance between the two slits so that you can resolve two separate diffraction patterns on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To resolve two separate diffraction patterns on the screen, we need to ensure that the central maximum of one pattern does not overlap with the first minimum of the other pattern. We can use the formula for the angular position of the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the slit width.\n\nFor our problem, λ = 500 nm = 5 * 10^(-7) m, and a = 0.2 mm = 2 * 10^(-4) m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nθ = (1 * 5 * 10^(-7) m) / (2 * 10^(-4) m) = 2.5 * 10^(-3) radians\n\nNow, we need to find the linear distance on the screen corresponding to this angular separation. We can use the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the linear distance on the screen, L is the distance between the slit and the screen, and θ is the angular separation. In our case, L = 1 m, and θ = 2.5 * 10^(-3) radians. Therefore:\n\ny = 1 m * tan(2.5 * 10^(-3)) ≈ 1 m * (2.5 * 10^(-3)) = 2.5 * 10^(-3) m = 2.5 mm\n\nThis is the minimum distance between the central maximum of one pattern and the first minimum of the other pattern on the screen. To find the minimum distance between the two slits, we can use similar triangles:\n\nd / 1 m = 2.5 mm / 2.5 * 10^(-3) m\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits. Solving for d, we get:\n\nd = 1 m * (2.5 * 10^(-3) m) = 2.5 * 10^(-3) m = 2.5 mm\n\nSo, the minimum distance between the two slits should be 2.5 mm to resolve two separate diffraction patterns on the screen."
