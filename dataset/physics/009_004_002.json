    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence between the glass and air interface, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (glass), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (air), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. At the critical angle, the light ray will be refracted along the interface, meaning θ2 = 90 degrees.\n\nThe refractive index of air is approximately 1. So, we have:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.8 degrees\n\nThe critical angle of incidence between the glass and air interface is approximately 41.8 degrees.\n\nNow, let's consider a light ray incident on the interface at an angle of 45 degrees. Since the angle of incidence (45 degrees) is greater than the critical angle (41.8 degrees), the light ray will undergo total internal reflection and will not be refracted."
