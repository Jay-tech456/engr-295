    "message_2": "The estimated abundance of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content. This value is derived from various lines of evidence, including:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. By studying the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can determine the relative amounts of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in the universe. The latest data from the Planck satellite mission suggests that dark matter makes up about 26.8% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\n2. Galaxy Rotation Curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of galaxies show that they rotate faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together. The amount of dark matter required to explain these observations is consistent with the 27% estimate.\n\n3. Gravitational Lensing: When light from distant galaxies passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the light is bent, causing the background galaxies to appear distorted. By analyzing these distortions, scientists can map the distribution of mass in the foreground object, including the invisible dark matter. The mass estimates from gravitational lensing studies also support the 27% dark matter abundance.\n\n4. Large Scale Structure Formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of structure formation, which take into account the effects of dark matter, produce results that closely match the observed large-scale structure of the universe. These simulations also support the 27% dark matter abundance.\n\n5. Cosmic Nucleosynthesis: The abundance of light elements, such as helium and deuterium, produced in the early universe depends on the density of ordinary matter (baryons). By comparing the observed abundances of these elements with theoretical predictions, scientists can determine the baryon density, which is found to be around 5% of the total mass-energy content. Since the total matter density (including dark matter) is around 32%, the remaining 27% is attributed to dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the estimated abundance of dark matter in the universe is about 27%, based on multiple lines of evidence from cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics."
