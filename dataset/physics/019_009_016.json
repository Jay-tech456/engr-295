    "message_2": "In a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction term, the Lagrangian density is given by:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂_μ φ)(∂^μ φ) - 1/2 m^2 φ^2 - λ/4! φ^4\n\nwhere φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the coupling constant of the quartic interaction term.\n\nTo compute the beta function of the coupling constant λ to one-loop order in perturbation theory, we need to calculate the renormalization group equation (RGE) for the coupling constant. The RGE is given by:\n\nμ (dλ/dμ) = β(λ)\n\nwhere μ is the renormalization scale, and β(λ) is the beta function we want to compute.\n\nTo calculate the beta function to one-loop order, we need to compute the one-loop correction to the quartic interaction vertex. This can be done using Feynman diagrams and the rules of perturbation theory. The relevant diagram for the one-loop correction is the \"sunset\" or \"tadpole\" diagram, which consists of a loop with two quartic vertices connected by two propagators.\n\nAfter calculating the one-loop correction to the vertex, we can extract the beta function by comparing the renormalized and bare coupling constants. The result for the beta function of a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction term to one-loop order in perturbation theory is:\n\nβ(λ) = (3/2π^2) λ^2\n\nThis result shows that the coupling constant λ increases with the renormalization scale μ, indicating that the theory is asymptotically free."
