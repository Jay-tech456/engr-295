    "message_2": "The maximum radiation dosage a human astronaut can withstand during a long-term space mission depends on several factors, including the duration of the mission, the shielding provided by the spacecraft, and the individual's age, gender, and health.\n\nIn general, the radiation dose limit for astronauts is set by various space agencies, such as NASA and ESA. NASA has established a career limit for astronauts based on the age and gender of the individual. This limit is expressed in Sieverts (Sv), a unit that quantifies the biological effect of ionizing radiation.\n\nFor a long-term space mission, NASA's guidelines set the following career dose limits:\n\n1. For male astronauts aged 30-60, the limit ranges from 0.6 to 4 Sv.\n2. For female astronauts aged 30-60, the limit ranges from 0.4 to 3 Sv.\n\nThese limits are lower for female astronauts due to their higher risk of developing radiation-induced cancer.\n\nCosmic rays, which consist of high-energy particles originating from outside our solar system, pose a significant radiation risk to astronauts during long-term space missions. The spacecraft's shielding, as well as the astronaut's personal protective equipment, can help reduce the exposure to cosmic rays. However, complete protection is not possible due to the high energy of these particles.\n\nIt is important to note that these limits are set to minimize the risk of radiation-induced cancer and other long-term health effects. During a long-term space mission, astronauts may still experience acute radiation sickness if exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period, such as during a solar particle event.\n\nIn summary, the maximum radiation dosage a human astronaut can withstand during a long-term space mission depends on their age, gender, and the effectiveness of the shielding provided by the spacecraft. The career dose limits set by NASA range from 0.4 to 4 Sv, with lower limits for female astronauts."
