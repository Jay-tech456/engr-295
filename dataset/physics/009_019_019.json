    "message_1": "In Young's double slit experiment, a laser with a wavelength of 650 nm is used to pass through two slits that are 0.05 mm apart. The interference pattern produced on a screen placed 1 m away from the slits has a distance of 2 mm between the central maximum and the first-order maximum. Determine the distance between the first-order maximum and the second-order maximum on the screen.",
    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the first-order maximum and the second-order maximum on the screen, we can use the formula for the position of the maxima in a double-slit interference pattern:\n\ny_n = (n * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y_n is the distance from the central maximum to the n-th order maximum, n is the order of the maximum (1 for first-order, 2 for second-order), λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\nd = 0.05 mm = 0.05 * 10^(-3) m\nL = 1 m\ny_1 = 2 mm = 2 * 10^(-3) m (distance between central maximum and first-order maximum)\n\nFirst, let's confirm that the given values are consistent with the formula:\n\ny_1 = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.05 * 10^(-3))\ny_1 = 1.3 * 10^(-2) m = 1.3 cm = 13 mm\n\nThe given value of 2 mm seems to be incorrect based on the formula. We will use the calculated value of 13 mm for y_1 instead.\n\nNow, let's find the distance between the first-order maximum and the second-order maximum (y_2 - y_1):\n\ny_2 = (2 * 650 * 10^(-9) * 1) / (0.05 * 10^(-3))\ny_2 = 2.6 * 10^(-2) m = 2.6 cm = 26 mm\n\nThe distance between the first-order maximum and the second-order maximum is:\n\ny_2 - y_1 = 26 mm - 13 mm = 13 mm\n\nSo, the distance between the first-order maximum and the second-order maximum on the screen is 13 mm."
