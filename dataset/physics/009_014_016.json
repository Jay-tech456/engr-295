    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the red and blue focus for the lens, we need to consider the chromatic aberration caused by the dispersion of light. The dispersive power (ω) of the lens is given, and we can use the following formula to find the difference in focal lengths for red and blue light:\n\nΔf = ω * (f_B - f_R)\n\nwhere Δf is the difference in focal lengths, f_B is the focal length for blue light, and f_R is the focal length for red light.\n\nWe know that the dispersive power (ω) is 0.03, and the average focal length (f) is 25 cm. We can use the average focal length to find the focal lengths for red and blue light:\n\nf = (f_B + f_R) / 2\n\nNow we need to express f_B and f_R in terms of f and Δf:\n\nf_B = f + Δf/2\nf_R = f - Δf/2\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for dispersive power:\n\nω = (f_B - f_R) / (f_B + f_R)\n\nReplacing f_B and f_R with the expressions in terms of f and Δf:\n\nω = ((f + Δf/2) - (f - Δf/2)) / ((f + Δf/2) + (f - Δf/2))\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nω = Δf / (2f)\n\nNow we can solve for Δf:\n\nΔf = ω * 2f\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔf = 0.03 * 2 * 25 cm\n\nΔf = 1.5 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the red and blue focus for the lens is 1.5 cm."
