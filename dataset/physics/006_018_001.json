    "message_2": "The Auger effect is a process in which an electron from an outer shell fills a core hole, and the excess energy is transferred to another electron, which is then emitted. In a helium atom, there are two electrons in the 1s shell. When a photon of energy 19.7 eV is absorbed, one of the electrons is ejected, creating a core hole.\n\nThe ionization energy of the helium atom is 24.6 eV. Since the photon energy is 19.7 eV, it is not sufficient to ionize the second electron. Therefore, the Auger effect cannot occur in this case, and the probability of the Auger effect occurring is 0.\n\nHowever, if we consider a helium ion with a single electron (He+), the ionization energy is 54.4 eV. In this case, the 19.7 eV photon is still not sufficient to ionize the electron, and the Auger effect cannot occur. The resulting configuration of the helium atom after absorbing the 19.7 eV photon would be a singly ionized helium atom (He+)."
