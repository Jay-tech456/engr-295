    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite an electron from the ground state (n=1) to the n=3 excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level (n=3), ni is the initial energy level (n=1), and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/3^2 - 1/1^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/9 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-8/9)\n\nΔE ≈ 12.1 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite an electron from the ground state to the n=3 excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 12.1 electron volts (eV)."
