According to an observer on Earth, the spaceship's clock ticks 3 times slower than a clock on Earth. What is the time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship's crew?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship's crew due to the gravitational field of the black hole. We can use the Schwarzschild metric to calculate this factor. The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric massive object, such as a black hole.\n\nThe time dilation factor, also known as the gravitational redshift factor, can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ntime dilation factor = sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (c^2 * r))\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s)\n- r is the distance from the center of the black hole to the spaceship\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 1,000,000 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^36 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the distance from the center of the black hole to the spaceship. The event horizon of a black hole is defined as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs):\n\nRs = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nWe are given that the spaceship is 500 km from the event horizon, so we need to add this distance to the Schwarzschild radius to find the total distance r:\n\nr = Rs + 500 km\n\nNow we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\ntime dilation factor = sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (c^2 * r))\n\nFirst, we need to find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^36 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.954 × 10^9 m\n\nNow we can find the total distance r:\n\nr = 2.954 × 10^9 m + 500,000 m\nr ≈ 2.9545 × 10^9 m\n\nFinally, we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\ntime dilation factor = sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^36 kg) / ((3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2 * 2.9545 × 10^9 m))\ntime dilation factor ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6667)\ntime dilation factor ≈ sqrt(0.3333)\n\ntime dilation factor ≈ 0.5774\n\nAccording to the observer on Earth, the spaceship's clock ticks 3 times slower than a clock on Earth. Therefore, the time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship's crew is 1/3 of the Earth's time dilation factor:\n\ntime dilation factor (spaceship) = 0.5774 / 3\ntime dilation factor (spaceship) ≈ 0.1925\n\nSo, the time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship's crew is approximately 0.1925."
