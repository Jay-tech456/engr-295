    "message_1": "A current-carrying motor has a wire of 5 meters in length and carries a current of 3 amperes. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 2 meters away from the wire and perpendicular to it?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 2 meters away from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nI = 3 A\nr = 2 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 2 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm * 3 A) / (2 * 2 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) Tm) / (4 m)\n\nB = 3 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located 2 meters away from the wire and perpendicular to it is 3 × 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. Point your thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire) and curl your fingers. Your fingers will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since the point is located perpendicular to the wire, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the direction of the current in the wire."
