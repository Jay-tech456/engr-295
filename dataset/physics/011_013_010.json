Calculate the current density in a gold wire that has a cross-sectional area of 0.5 mm² and a length of 5 meters, when a voltage of 10 volts is applied to its ends.",
    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of gold at room temperature is given as 45.5 million Siemens/meter (45.5 x 10^6 S/m). To find the resistivity, we can use the formula:\n\nResistivity (ρ) = 1 / Conductivity (σ)\n\nResistivity (ρ) = 1 / (45.5 x 10^6 S/m) ≈ 2.1978 x 10^-8 Ωm\n\nNow, let's calculate the current density in the gold wire. First, we need to find the resistance of the wire using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nThe cross-sectional area is given in mm², so we need to convert it to m²:\n\n0.5 mm² = 0.5 x 10^-6 m²\n\nNow we can calculate the resistance:\n\nResistance (R) = (2.1978 x 10^-8 Ωm) × (5 m) / (0.5 x 10^-6 m²) ≈ 0.21978 Ω\n\nNext, we can find the current (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\nVoltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R)\n\nCurrent (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R) = 10 V / 0.21978 Ω ≈ 45.5 A\n\nFinally, we can calculate the current density (J) using the formula:\n\nCurrent Density (J) = Current (I) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nCurrent Density (J) = 45.5 A / (0.5 x 10^-6 m²) ≈ 91 x 10^6 A/m²\n\nSo, the current density in the gold wire is approximately 91 x 10^6 A/m²."
