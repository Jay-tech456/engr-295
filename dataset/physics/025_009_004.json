    "message_2": "The minimum amplitude of a sound wave required for a human to hear it is related to the concept of the threshold of hearing. The threshold of hearing is the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) at which a sound can be detected by the average human ear. This threshold is frequency-dependent, as our ears are more sensitive to certain frequencies.\n\nAt a frequency of 1 kHz, the threshold of hearing is typically around 20 micropascals (µPa) or 0 dB SPL (decibels sound pressure level). This value is used as the reference point for measuring sound levels in decibels. It is important to note that the threshold of hearing varies among individuals and can be affected by factors such as age, hearing damage, and background noise.\n\nIn biophysics, the threshold of hearing is related to the sensitivity of the hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain. These hair cells are more sensitive to certain frequencies, which is why the threshold of hearing is frequency-dependent.\n\nIn summary, the minimum amplitude of a sound wave required for a human to hear it is approximately 20 µPa at a frequency of 1 kHz, and this value is related to the concept of the threshold of hearing in biophysics, which is determined by the sensitivity of the hair cells in the inner ear."
