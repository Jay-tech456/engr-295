    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nIn mathematical terms, Ampere's Law is given by:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is symmetrical and circles around the inner conductor. We can choose a circular path with a radius of 2 mm as our loop. Since the magnetic field is tangential to the loop, the dot product (B ⋅ dl) becomes B * dl. The integral then simplifies to:\n\nB * ∮ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the circular path is equal to the circumference of the circle:\n\n∮ dl = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circular path, which is 2 mm in this case. Therefore,\n\n∮ dl = 2 * π * 2 mm = 4 * π mm\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the loop is inside the inner conductor, the entire current of 2 A is enclosed by the loop:\n\nI_enclosed = 2 A\n\nNow we can plug in the values into Ampere's Law:\n\nB * (4 * π mm) = μ₀ * 2 A\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nB * (4 * π mm) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A\n\nDividing both sides by 4 * π, we get:\n\nB = (2 * 10^(-7) Tm) * (1/1 mm)\n\nSince 1 mm = 10^(-3) m, we can convert the denominator to meters:\n\nB = (2 * 10^(-7) T) * (1/10^(-3) m)\n\nB = 2 * 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm from the center of the cable is 2 * 10^(-4) T or 200 μT."
