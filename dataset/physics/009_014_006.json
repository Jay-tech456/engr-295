Find the distance between the images formed by blue and yellow components of light at the screen. (Given: refractive index of material of the lens = 1.5 and dispersion of the material of the lens = 0.03)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the focal lengths of the lens for blue and yellow light components and then find the distance between their images on the screen.\n\nFirst, let's find the focal lengths for blue and yellow light components using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (μ - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, μ is the refractive index of the lens material, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. Since we are given the focal length (f) and the refractive index (μ) for white light, we can find the difference in radii of curvature (1/R1 - 1/R2) for the lens:\n\n1/30 = (1.5 - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n1/30 = 0.5(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nNow, let's find the refractive indices for blue and yellow light components using the dispersion of the lens material:\n\nμ_blue = μ + Δμ\nμ_yellow = μ - Δμ\n\nwhere Δμ is the dispersion of the lens material (0.03). So,\n\nμ_blue = 1.5 + 0.03 = 1.53\nμ_yellow = 1.5 - 0.03 = 1.47\n\nNow, we can find the focal lengths for blue and yellow light components using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f_blue = (1.53 - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n1/f_yellow = (1.47 - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nWe already know the value of (1/R1 - 1/R2) from the white light calculation:\n\n1/f_blue = 0.53(1/30 ÷ 0.5)\n1/f_yellow = 0.47(1/30 ÷ 0.5)\n\nNow, we can find the focal lengths:\n\nf_blue = 1 / (0.53(1/30 ÷ 0.5)) ≈ 29.13 cm\nf_yellow = 1 / (0.47(1/30 ÷ 0.5)) ≈ 30.85 cm\n\nNext, we will use the lens formula to find the image distances for blue and yellow light components:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere u is the object distance, v is the image distance, and f is the focal length. Since the screen is placed 60 cm away from the lens, we have u = -60 cm (the negative sign indicates that the object is on the left side of the lens). Now, we can find the image distances for blue and yellow light components:\n\n1/29.13 = 1/(-60) + 1/v_blue\n1/30.85 = 1/(-60) + 1/v_yellow\n\nSolving for v_blue and v_yellow:\n\nv_blue ≈ 58.26 cm\nv_yellow ≈ 61.70 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the images formed by blue and yellow components of light at the screen:\n\nDistance = |v_blue - v_yellow| = |58.26 - 61.70| ≈ 3.44 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the images formed by blue and yellow components of light at the screen is approximately 3.44 cm."
