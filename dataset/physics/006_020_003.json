    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section (σ) for an electron scattering off a helium atom can be calculated using the Mott formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0))^2 * (1 / (4 * E * sin^4(θ/2))) * (1 - β^2 * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- Z is the atomic number of the target atom (Z = 2 for helium)\n- e is the elementary charge (e = 1.602 × 10^-19 C)\n- ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε_0 = 8.854 × 10^-12 C^2/N m^2)\n- E is the incident electron energy (E = 10 keV = 10 × 10^3 eV)\n- θ is the scattering angle (θ = 60 degrees)\n- β is the ratio of the electron's velocity to the speed of light (β = v/c)\n\nFirst, we need to find the electron's velocity (v) using its energy (E):\n\nE = (1/2) * m_e * v^2\n\nwhere m_e is the electron mass (m_e = 9.109 × 10^-31 kg). Solving for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * E / m_e)\n\nNow, we can find β:\n\nβ = v / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (c = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Mott scattering cross section (σ) using the Mott formula:\n\n1. Convert the incident electron energy to Joules: E = 10 keV * 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV = 1.602 × 10^-15 J\n2. Calculate the electron's velocity: v = sqrt(2 * E / m_e) = sqrt(2 * 1.602 × 10^-15 J / 9.109 × 10^-31 kg) ≈ 1.875 × 10^8 m/s\n3. Calculate β: β = v / c = 1.875 × 10^8 m/s / 2.998 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 0.625\n4. Convert the scattering angle to radians: θ = 60 degrees * π/180 = π/3 radians\n5. Calculate the Mott scattering cross section: σ(θ) = (2 * 1.602 × 10^-19 C / (4 * π * 8.854 × 10^-12 C^2/N m^2))^2 * (1 / (4 * 1.602 × 10^-15 J * sin^4(π/6))) * (1 - 0.625^2 * sin^2(π/6)) ≈ 1.14 × 10^-28 m^2\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom with a scattering angle of 60 degrees and an incident electron energy of 10 keV is approximately 1.14 × 10^-28 m^2."
