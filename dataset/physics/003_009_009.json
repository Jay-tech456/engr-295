    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field produced by the wire at a distance of 10 cm from its center, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nAmpere's Law: ∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a spherical wire with uniform current distribution, the magnetic field will be symmetrical and directed along the circular path centered at the sphere. Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius of 10 cm (0.1 m) centered at the sphere.\n\nThe magnetic field (B) will be constant along the Amperian loop, so we can write Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the Amperian loop. Since the wire has a uniform current distribution, we can find the current density (J) as follows:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere I is the total current (2 A) and A is the surface area of the spherical wire. The surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nA = 4πR²\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere (0.05 m). Therefore, the surface area of the wire is:\n\nA = 4π(0.05)² = 0.01π m²\n\nNow, we can find the current density (J):\n\nJ = 2 A / 0.01π m² ≈ 63.66 A/m²\n\nNext, we need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the Amperian loop. Since the loop is at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center of the sphere, it encloses the entire sphere. Therefore, the enclosed current is equal to the total current:\n\nI_enclosed = 2 A\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B) using Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2π(0.1) = μ₀(2)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nB * 2π(0.1) = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2\n\nB * 0.2π = 8π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T) / (0.2π)\n\nB ≈ 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the wire at a distance of 10 cm from its center is approximately 4 × 10^(-6) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field will be tangential to the circular path centered at the sphere, following the right-hand rule for current-carrying wires."
