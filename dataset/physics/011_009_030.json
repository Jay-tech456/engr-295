    "message_2": "To find the Hall coefficient (R_H) in a semiconductor material, we can use the formula:\n\nR_H = 1 / (q * n)\n\nwhere q is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C) and n is the carrier concentration (1 x 10^17 cm^-3).\n\nR_H = 1 / (1.6 x 10^-19 C * 1 x 10^17 cm^-3)\n\nR_H = 1 / (1.6 x 10^-2 C/cm^3)\n\nR_H = 1 / 1.6 x 10^2 cm^3/C\n\nR_H = 6.25 x 10^-3 cm^3/C\n\nThe Hall coefficient (R_H) for the given semiconductor material is 6.25 x 10^-3 cm^3/C."
