    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observation and measurement of gravitational lensing in astrophysics. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxies or galaxy clusters. This bending of light can create multiple images, distortions, or magnifications of distant objects, allowing astronomers to study the distribution of mass in the universe.\n\nDark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Since dark matter does not emit or absorb light, it cannot be directly observed. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, and on the bending of light due to gravitational lensing.\n\nSupporting evidence for the impact of dark matter on gravitational lensing includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, which contributes to the overall gravitational potential and affects the lensing properties of the galaxy.\n\n2. Galaxy cluster mass measurements: Gravitational lensing studies of galaxy clusters have revealed that the total mass of these clusters is much greater than the mass of the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter, which influences the lensing properties of the cluster.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB have shown that the distribution of matter in the early universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which would have affected the formation of large-scale structures and the lensing properties of the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure observations: Studies of the large-scale distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters have shown that the observed structures are consistent with the presence of dark matter. This dark matter would have played a crucial role in the formation of these structures and their lensing properties.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the observation and measurement of gravitational lensing in astrophysics. Its gravitational influence on visible matter and light allows astronomers to indirectly study the distribution and properties of dark matter, providing crucial insights into the nature of this mysterious component of the universe."
