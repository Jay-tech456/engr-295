    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum distance that can be detected by LIGO for a binary system with masses 30 times that of the sun and a frequency of 100 Hz, we need to consider the sensitivity of LIGO and the strain amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary system.\n\nThe sensitivity of LIGO is characterized by its noise spectral density, which is typically given in units of strain per square root of frequency (Hz^(-1/2)). The design sensitivity of LIGO is around 10^(-23) Hz^(-1/2) at 100 Hz.\n\nThe strain amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary system can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * d)\n\nwhere:\n- h is the strain amplitude\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))\n- M is the total mass of the binary system (30 times the mass of the sun, M_sun = 1.9885 × 10^30 kg)\n- ω is the angular frequency of the binary system (ω = 2 * π * f, where f is the frequency)\n- r is the separation between the two masses in the binary system\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)\n- d is the distance to the binary system\n\nFor a binary system with equal masses, the separation r can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nr = (G * M) / (4 * ω^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for the distance d:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the binary system:\nM = 30 * M_sun = 30 * 1.9885 × 10^30 kg = 5.9655 × 10^31 kg\n\n2. Calculate the angular frequency ω:\nω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 100 Hz ≈ 628.32 s^(-1)\n\n3. Calculate the separation r:\nr = (G * M) / (4 * ω^2) ≈ (6.67430 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 5.9655 × 10^31 kg) / (4 * (628.32 s^(-1))^2) ≈ 1.189 × 10^6 m\n\n4. Set the strain amplitude h equal to the sensitivity of LIGO at 100 Hz:\nh = 10^(-23)\n\n5. Solve for the distance d:\nd = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * h) ≈ (4 * 6.67430 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 5.9655 × 10^31 kg * (628.32 s^(-1))^2 * 1.189 × 10^6 m) / ((2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * 10^(-23)) ≈ 4.23 × 10^25 m\n\nThe maximum distance that can be detected by LIGO for this binary system is approximately 4.23 × 10^25 meters. However, this is a rough estimate and assumes that the sensitivity of LIGO is constant across all frequencies, which is not the case in reality. Additionally, this calculation does not take into account the orientation of the binary system with respect to the LIGO detectors, which can also affect the detectable distance."
