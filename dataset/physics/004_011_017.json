Determine the electric potential at the event horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole with a charge of 6.24 x 10^-19 coulombs and a mass of 2 solar masses.",
    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a charged, non-rotating black hole, while the Schwarzschild black hole is an uncharged, non-rotating black hole. The Reissner-Nordström black hole is described by the Reissner-Nordström metric, which depends on both the mass (M) and the charge (Q) of the black hole. The Schwarzschild black hole is a special case of the Reissner-Nordström black hole when the charge Q is zero.\n\nThe Reissner-Nordström metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r²)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nThe event horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole is located at:\n\nr_± = GM/c² ± √((GM/c²)² - GQ²/c⁴)\n\nTo find the electric potential at the event horizon, we can use the formula:\n\nV = Q/(4πε₀r)\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nGiven the charge Q = 6.24 x 10⁻¹⁹ C and the mass M = 2 solar masses, we can first find the event horizon radius r_+:\n\nM = 2 solar masses = 2 * 1.989 x 10³⁰ kg = 3.978 x 10³⁰ kg\n\nr_+ = G * M / c² + √((G * M / c²)² - G * Q² / c⁴)\nr_+ ≈ 2 * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg s²) * (3.978 x 10³⁰ kg) / (9 x 10¹⁶ m²/s²) + √((2 * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg s²) * (3.978 x 10³⁰ kg) / (9 x 10¹⁶ m²/s²))² - (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg s²) * (6.24 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)² / (9 x 10¹⁶ m²/s²))\nr_+ ≈ 2.952 x 10³ m\n\nNow we can find the electric potential at the event horizon:\n\nV = Q / (4πε₀r_+)\nV ≈ (6.24 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) / (4π * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² C²/N m² * 2.952 x 10³ m)\nV ≈ 2.99 x 10⁵ V\n\nSo, the electric potential at the event horizon of the given Reissner-Nordström black hole is approximately 2.99 x 10⁵ volts."
