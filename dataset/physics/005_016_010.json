    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy. Let's denote the moving electron as electron 1 and the stationary electron as electron 2. The initial momentum of the system is given by:\n\np_initial = m1 * v1_initial + m2 * v2_initial\n\nSince electron 2 is at rest, v2_initial = 0. The initial momentum is then:\n\np_initial = m1 * v1_initial\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the system is given by:\n\nKE_initial = (1/2) * m1 * (v1_initial)^2 + (1/2) * m2 * (v2_initial)^2\n\nSince electron 2 is at rest, KE_initial = (1/2) * m1 * (v1_initial)^2\n\nNow, let's denote the final velocities of electron 1 and electron 2 as v1_final and v2_final, respectively. The final momentum of the system is given by:\n\np_final = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the system is given by:\n\nKE_final = (1/2) * m1 * (v1_final)^2 + (1/2) * m2 * (v2_final)^2\n\nSince the collision is elastic, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Therefore, we have:\n\np_initial = p_final\nm1 * v1_initial = m1 * v1_final + m2 * v2_final\n\nKE_initial = KE_final\n(1/2) * m1 * (v1_initial)^2 = (1/2) * m1 * (v1_final)^2 + (1/2) * m2 * (v2_final)^2\n\nSince both electrons have the same mass (m1 = m2 = m), we can simplify the equations:\n\nv1_initial = v1_final + v2_final\n\n(1/2) * (v1_initial)^2 = (1/2) * (v1_final)^2 + (1/2) * (v2_final)^2\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (v1_final and v2_final). We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nv1_final = v1_initial - v2_final\n\nSubstitute this expression into the kinetic energy conservation equation:\n\n(1/2) * (v1_initial)^2 = (1/2) * (v1_initial - v2_final)^2 + (1/2) * (v2_final)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for v2_final:\n\nv1_initial^2 = (v1_initial - v2_final)^2 + v2_final^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nv1_initial^2 = v1_initial^2 - 2 * v1_initial * v2_final + v2_final^2 + v2_final^2\n0 = 2 * v2_final^2 - 2 * v1_initial * v2_final\n\nFactor out 2 * v2_final:\n\n0 = 2 * v2_final * (v2_final - v1_initial)\n\nThis equation has two solutions: v2_final = 0 and v2_final = v1_initial. The first solution (v2_final = 0) corresponds to the initial condition, where electron 2 is at rest. The second solution (v2_final = v1_initial) corresponds to the final condition after the collision. Therefore, we have:\n\nv2_final = v1_initial = 0.8c\n\nNow we can find v1_final using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nv1_final = v1_initial - v2_final\nv1_final = 0.8c - 0.8c\nv1_final = 0\n\nSo, after the elastic collision, electron 1 comes to rest (v1_final = 0), and electron 2 moves with the initial velocity of electron 1 (v2_final = 0.8c)."
