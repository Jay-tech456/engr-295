    "message_2": "To determine the drag force acting on the sphere, we can use the drag equation:\n\nF_d = 0.5 * C_d * ρ * v^2 * A\n\nwhere F_d is the drag force, C_d is the drag coefficient, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the sphere, and A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the drag coefficient (C_d). The Reynolds number is given by:\n\nRe = (ρ * v * D) / μ\n\nwhere D is the diameter of the sphere, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nGiven values:\nRadius (r) = 0.05 m\nDiameter (D) = 2 * r = 2 * 0.05 m = 0.1 m\nFluid density (ρ) = 1000 kg/m³\nVelocity (v) = 10 m/s\nDynamic viscosity (μ) = 0.01 Pa∙s\n\nNow, let's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\nRe = (1000 * 10 * 0.1) / 0.01 = 100000\n\nFor a sphere, the drag coefficient (C_d) can be approximated using the following empirical relation for the given range of Reynolds number:\n\nC_d ≈ 0.47\n\nNow, we need to find the cross-sectional area (A) of the sphere:\n\nA = π * r^2 = π * (0.05)^2 = 0.00785 m²\n\nFinally, we can calculate the drag force (F_d):\n\nF_d = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1000 * (10)^2 * 0.00785 = 183.575 N\n\nSo, the drag force acting on the sphere is approximately 183.6 N."
