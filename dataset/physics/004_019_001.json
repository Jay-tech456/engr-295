Express your answer in seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for gravitational time dilation, which is derived from the Schwarzschild metric in general relativity:\n\nΔt = Δt₀ / √(1 - 2GM/c²R)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time interval measured by the observer far away from the massive body,\nΔt₀ is the time interval measured by the observer close to the massive body (2 hours in this case),\nG is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²),\nM is the mass of the massive body,\nc is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s),\nR is the distance from the center of the massive body to the observer close to it,\nand the gravitational field strength g is given by GM/R².\n\nWe are given the gravitational field strength g = 9.8 N/kg, and we need to find the time dilation effect Δt - Δt₀.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass M of the massive body and the distance R from the center of the massive body to the observer close to it. We can do this by rearranging the formula for gravitational field strength:\n\ng = GM/R²\n=> GM = gR²\n\nWe don't have enough information to find M and R separately, but we can find the ratio GM/R², which is what we need for the time dilation formula.\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = Δt₀ / √(1 - 2GM/c²R)\n=> Δt = Δt₀ / √(1 - 2gR²/c²R)\n\nSince Δt₀ = 2 hours, we need to convert it to seconds: Δt₀ = 2 * 60 * 60 = 7200 s.\n\nΔt = 7200 / √(1 - 2 * 9.8 * R² / (2.998 × 10⁸)² * R)\n=> Δt = 7200 / √(1 - 19.6R² / (2.998 × 10⁸)²)\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the time intervals Δt and Δt₀:\n\nΔt - Δt₀ = 7200 / √(1 - 19.6R² / (2.998 × 10⁸)²) - 7200\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot find an exact numerical value for the time dilation effect without knowing the value of R. However, the formula above shows how the time dilation effect depends on the distance R from the center of the massive body. As R increases, the time dilation effect decreases, and as R approaches infinity (i.e., the observer is very far away from the massive body), the time dilation effect approaches zero."
