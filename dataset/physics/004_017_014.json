    "message_2": "Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that the angle of deflection of starlight passing near the sun's surface is given by the formula:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = 4 * G * M / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the sun, c is the speed of light, and b is the distance of closest approach to the sun.\n\nUsing the known values for G, M, and c, and considering that the distance of closest approach (b) is approximately equal to the sun's radius (R), we can calculate the deflection angle:\n\nα = 4 * G * M / (c^2 * R)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nG = 6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)\nM = 1.989 × 10^30 kg\nc = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s\nR = 6.963 × 10^8 m\n\nα ≈ 4 * (6.674 × 10^(-11)) * (1.989 × 10^30) / ((2.998 × 10^8)^2 * (6.963 × 10^8))\nα ≈ 8.5 × 10^(-6) radians\n\nTo convert this to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds:\n\nα ≈ 8.5 × 10^(-6) * 206265\nα ≈ 1.75 arcseconds\n\nSo, the predicted angle of deflection of starlight passing near the sun's surface according to Einstein's general theory of relativity is approximately 1.75 arcseconds.\n\nDuring the solar eclipse of 1919, Sir Arthur Eddington and his team conducted an experiment to measure the deflection of starlight near the sun's surface. Their observations showed a deflection angle of approximately 1.61 arcseconds, with an uncertainty of about 0.30 arcseconds. This value was within the range of the predicted value of 1.75 arcseconds, considering the uncertainty.\n\nThe close agreement between the predicted and observed values of the deflection angle supported Einstein's general theory of relativity. This experiment was a major milestone in the acceptance of the theory, as it provided experimental evidence for the bending of light due to gravity, which was a key prediction of the theory."
