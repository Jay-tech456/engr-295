    "message_2": "Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a state of matter that is believed to have existed just after the Big Bang, where quarks and gluons were not confined within hadrons. The QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) phase transition refers to the transition between the QGP state and the hadronic state, where quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons. The formation of QGP and its transition to the hadronic state can be studied in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, such as those performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).\n\nThere are several primary signals or markers that indicate the formation of QGP during the QCD phase transition:\n\n1. Jet quenching: In a QGP, the energy loss of high-energy partons (quarks and gluons) is expected to be much higher than in a hadronic medium. This energy loss leads to the suppression of high transverse momentum particles, which is known as jet quenching. This phenomenon can be quantified by the nuclear modification factor (RAA), which compares the production of high transverse momentum particles in heavy-ion collisions to that in proton-proton collisions.\n\n2. Strangeness enhancement: The production of strange quarks is expected to be enhanced in a QGP compared to a hadronic medium. This is because the QGP provides a more favorable environment for the production of strange quarks due to the high energy density and the presence of many gluons. The enhancement of strangeness can be observed through the increased production of strange hadrons, such as kaons, lambdas, and phi mesons.\n\n3. Quarkonium suppression: Quarkonium states, such as J/ψ and Υ, are bound states of heavy quarks (charm and bottom, respectively) and their corresponding antiquarks. In a QGP, the screening of the strong force between the heavy quarks by the surrounding quarks and gluons is expected to lead to the suppression of quarkonium production. This can be observed through the reduced production of quarkonium states in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions.\n\n4. Collective flow: The expansion of the QGP and its subsequent conversion to hadrons is expected to generate collective flow patterns in the final state particles. These flow patterns can be characterized by anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow (v2) and triangular flow (v3), which can be measured through the azimuthal distribution of particles in heavy-ion collisions.\n\nThe signals at the hadronization stage, where the QGP converts into hadrons, are different from those during the QGP formation:\n\n1. Hadron yields and ratios: At the hadronization stage, the QGP converts into various hadrons, and their yields and ratios can provide information about the conditions at the time of hadronization. By comparing the measured hadron yields and ratios to those predicted by statistical models, one can extract information about the temperature, chemical potential, and other properties of the system at the hadronization stage.\n\n2. HBT (Hanbury-Brown-Twiss) interferometry: This technique is used to measure the spatial and temporal extent of the particle-emitting source in heavy-ion collisions. By analyzing the correlations between identical particles, such as pions or kaons, one can extract information about the size and lifetime of the system at the hadronization stage.\n\nIn summary, the primary signals of QGP formation during the QCD phase transition include jet quenching, strangeness enhancement, quarkonium suppression, and collective flow, while the signals at the hadronization stage are mainly related to hadron yields, ratios, and HBT interferometry. These signals provide crucial information about the properties and dynamics of the QGP and its transition to the hadronic state."
