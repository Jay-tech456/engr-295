    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point situated 10 cm away from the center of the rod, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is parallel to the ground and we want to find the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center, we can consider the problem in two dimensions. Let's place the rod along the x-axis with its center at the origin (0,0). The point where we want to find the magnetic field will be at (0, 10 cm).\n\nNow, let's divide the rod into small segments of length dx. The position vector r for each segment will be (x, 10 cm). The magnetic field dB at the point due to each segment is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx x r) / r³\n\nSince the rod is parallel to the ground, the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane formed by the rod and the point. Therefore, we can simplify the cross product as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx) / r³\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire length of the rod, from -15 cm to 15 cm (since the rod is 30 cm long and centered at the origin):\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx) / r³\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dx) / r³\n\nNow, let's evaluate the integral:\n\nr = √(x² + (10 cm)²)\nr³ = (x² + 100 cm²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dx) / (x² + 100 cm²)^(3/2) from -15 cm to 15 cm\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method:\n\nLet x = 10 cm * tan(θ)\ndx = 10 cm * sec²(θ) * dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(10 cm * sec²(θ) * dθ) / (10 cm * sec(θ))³\n\nThe limits of integration will change accordingly:\n\nx = -15 cm => θ = arctan(-15 cm / 10 cm)\nx = 15 cm => θ = arctan(15 cm / 10 cm)\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dθ) / sec(θ) from arctan(-15 cm / 10 cm) to arctan(15 cm / 10 cm)\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * [arctan(15 cm / 10 cm) - arctan(-15 cm / 10 cm)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * 5 A * [arctan(15 cm / 10 cm) - arctan(-15 cm / 10 cm)]\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * 5 A * [arctan(15 cm / 10 cm) - arctan(-15 cm / 10 cm)]\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-7) T * [arctan(1.5) - arctan(-1.5)]\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-7) T * 2 * arctan(1.5)\n\nB ≈ 10 × 10^(-7) T * arctan(1.5)\n\nB ≈ 1 × 10^(-6) T * arctan(1.5)\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the point situated 10 cm away from the center of the rod is approximately 1 × 10^(-6) T * arctan(1.5)."
