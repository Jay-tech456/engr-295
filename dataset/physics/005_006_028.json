    "message_1": "Consider a gravitational redshift experiment where a light source is placed at a height of 10 meters above the surface of the Earth. If the gravitational potential difference between the source and a detector 2 meters above the Earth's surface is 6.67 × 10^-11 J/kg, what is the observed wavelength shift in the light emitted from the source?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the observed wavelength shift in the light emitted from the source, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔΦ/c^2\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔΦ is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given the gravitational potential difference ΔΦ = 6.67 × 10^-11 J/kg. Now we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.67 × 10^-11 J/kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.67 × 10^-11 J/kg) / (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nΔλ/λ = 7.41 × 10^-28\n\nNow, we need to find the change in wavelength Δλ. To do this, we need to know the initial wavelength λ. However, the problem does not provide this information. Therefore, we can only express the observed wavelength shift as a fraction of the initial wavelength:\n\nΔλ = λ × (7.41 × 10^-28)\n\nWithout knowing the initial wavelength λ, we cannot determine the exact observed wavelength shift Δλ. However, we can say that the shift is extremely small, on the order of 10^-28 times the initial wavelength."
