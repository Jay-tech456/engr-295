    "message_2": "To determine the energy of the cosmic ray proton that initiates a shower with a total energy of 10^11 eV, we need to consider the energy loss during the interaction with the Earth's atmosphere. \n\nWhen a cosmic ray proton enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with atmospheric nuclei, producing secondary particles such as pions, kaons, and other hadrons. These secondary particles can further decay or interact, leading to a cascade of particles known as an extensive air shower.\n\nThe energy of the primary cosmic ray proton is shared among these secondary particles, and some energy is lost due to ionization and excitation of atmospheric molecules. However, the energy loss in the atmosphere is typically a small fraction of the primary particle's energy.\n\nAssuming that the energy loss in the atmosphere is negligible, the energy of the cosmic ray proton that initiates the shower would be approximately equal to the total energy of the shower, which is 10^11 eV."
