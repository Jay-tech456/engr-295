(Given: vapor pressure of pure ethanol at 25 ˚C is 8.276 kPa and the vapor pressure of pure water at 25 ˚C is 3.169 kPa.).",
    "message_2": "To determine the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture, we can use Raoult's Law. Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in a mixture is equal to the product of its mole fraction and its vapor pressure in the pure state.\n\nLet's denote the mole fraction of ethanol as x_ethanol and the mole fraction of water as x_water. Since there are only two components in the mixture, x_ethanol + x_water = 1.\n\nGiven:\nx_ethanol = 0.6\nx_water = 1 - x_ethanol = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\nVapor pressure of pure ethanol (P_ethanol) = 8.276 kPa\nVapor pressure of pure water (P_water) = 3.169 kPa\n\nNow, we can use Raoult's Law to find the partial pressure of ethanol (P_ethanol_mixture) in the mixture:\n\nP_ethanol_mixture = x_ethanol * P_ethanol\nP_ethanol_mixture = 0.6 * 8.276 kPa\nP_ethanol_mixture = 4.9656 kPa\n\nThe fugacity of a component in a mixture is approximately equal to its partial pressure. Therefore, the fugacity of ethanol in the mixture is approximately 4.9656 kPa."
