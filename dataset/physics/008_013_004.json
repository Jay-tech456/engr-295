    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a fundamental particle belonging to the lepton family, which also includes the electron and muon. The tau lepton is the heaviest among the three leptons, with a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c².\n\nThe lifetime of a tau lepton is very short, approximately 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds. This short lifetime is due to its relatively large mass, which makes it more likely to decay into lighter particles through the weak force.\n\nCompared to other fundamental particles, the tau lepton has a shorter lifetime than some particles but longer than others. For instance, the electron is stable and does not decay, while the muon has a longer lifetime of about 2.2 x 10^(-6) seconds. On the other hand, some unstable particles like the W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak force, have even shorter lifetimes (around 10^(-25) seconds and 3 x 10^(-25) seconds, respectively).\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton has a lifetime of about 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds, which is shorter than the lifetimes of the electron and muon but longer than the lifetimes of some other unstable fundamental particles like the W and Z bosons."
