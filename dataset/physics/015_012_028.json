    "message_2": "In a binary system consisting of a pulsar and another massive object, such as a neutron star or a black hole, gravitational waves are emitted as a result of the orbital motion of the two objects. According to General Relativity, the energy carried away by these gravitational waves causes the orbit to shrink, which in turn affects the amplitude and frequency of the emitted waves.\n\nAs the separation between the two stars in the binary system reduces, the following changes occur:\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the mass of the objects and inversely proportional to the separation between them. As the separation decreases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves increases. Mathematically, the amplitude is given by:\n\n   h ~ (G * M * m) / (c^2 * r)\n\n   where h is the amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, c is the speed of light, and r is the separation between the objects.\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of the gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. As the separation between the objects decreases, the orbital frequency increases, and so does the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. The frequency of the gravitational waves is given by:\n\n   f = 2 * f_orbital\n\n   where f is the frequency of the gravitational waves and f_orbital is the orbital frequency of the binary system.\n\nThe changes in amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves as the separation between the two stars reduces have implications for our ability to detect these waves with current technology. Gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, have a specific range of frequencies and sensitivities within which they can detect gravitational waves.\n\nAs the amplitude of the gravitational waves increases, the signal becomes stronger, making it easier for detectors to identify the waves. However, if the frequency of the waves moves outside the sensitive frequency range of the detectors, it becomes more challenging to detect the waves.\n\nIn summary, as the separation between the two stars in a binary system reduces, the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves increases, making them easier to detect. At the same time, the frequency of the waves also increases, which could potentially move the signal outside the sensitive frequency range of current detectors, making it more challenging to detect. The overall detectability of the gravitational waves depends on the specific parameters of the binary system and the capabilities of the detectors."
