    "message_2": "To calculate the cross-section for the scattering of two fermions in a quantum field theory, we will use the framework of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In this case, the scattering process can be described by the Møller scattering (electron-electron scattering) or Bhabha scattering (electron-positron scattering) mediated by the exchange of a virtual photon.\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the Møller scattering (the Bhabha scattering can be treated similarly). The scattering amplitude for Møller scattering can be calculated using the Feynman rules for QED. The leading-order contribution comes from the exchange of a single virtual photon (t-channel and u-channel diagrams). The matrix element squared, summed over final spins and averaged over initial spins, is given by:\n\n|𝑀|^2 = (8𝜋^2𝛼^2/s^2) [(s^2 + u^2) / t^2 + (s^2 + t^2) / u^2]\n\nHere, 𝛼 is the fine structure constant (𝛼 ≈ 1/137), and s, t, and u are the Mandelstam variables, which are related to the energy and momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles. They are given by:\n\ns = (p1 + p2)^2\nt = (p1 - p3)^2\nu = (p1 - p4)^2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the initial momenta of the fermions, and p3 and p4 are the final momenta of the fermions.\n\nTo find the differential cross-section, we need to relate the Mandelstam variables to the scattering angle 𝜃 in the center of mass frame. Using the relation:\n\nt = -2E^2(1 - cos𝜃)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the incoming fermions in the center of mass frame, we can write the differential cross-section as:\n\nd𝜎/dΩ = (𝛼^2 / 16E^4sin^4(𝜃/2)) [(4E^2 - 2E^2cos𝜃)^2 / (2E^2(1 - cos𝜃))^2 + (4E^2 - 2E^2cos𝜃)^2 / (2E^2(1 + cos𝜃))^2]\n\nThe angle dependence of the cross-section can be seen in the expression above. The cross-section is symmetric with respect to the scattering angle 𝜃, and it diverges as 𝜃 approaches 0 or 𝜋 (forward and backward scattering). This is a characteristic feature of long-range interactions, such as the electromagnetic interaction.\n\nIn summary, we have calculated the cross-section for the scattering of two fermions in a quantum field theory, mediated by the exchange of a virtual photon, and found the angle dependence of the cross-section for this process."
