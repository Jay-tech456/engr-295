    "message_2": "The critical angle of incidence (θc) for a ray of light passing from a medium with a higher refractive index (n1) to a medium with a lower refractive index (n2) can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90°)\n\nSince the ray of light is passing from the diamond to air, we'll use the refractive index of diamond (n1 = 2.42) and the refractive index of air (n2 ≈ 1). Also, sin(90°) = 1, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n2.42 * sin(θc) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle θc:\n\nsin(θc) = 1 / 2.42\n\nθc = arcsin(1 / 2.42)\n\nθc ≈ 24.4°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for a ray of light passing through a diamond with a refractive index of 2.42 is approximately 24.4 degrees."
