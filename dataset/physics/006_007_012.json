    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference and then collide with mercury atoms. To excite a mercury atom from its ground state to its first excited state, the electron must transfer an energy of 4.9 eV to the atom.\n\nSince the energy required to excite the atom to its first excited state is 4.9 eV, the electron must have at least this much kinetic energy when it collides with the mercury atom. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:\n\nKE = eV\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 x 10^(-19) C), and V is the potential difference.\n\nTo find the minimum accelerating potential difference required, we can set the kinetic energy equal to the energy required to excite the atom:\n\n4.9 eV = eV\n\nSolving for V:\n\nV = 4.9 eV / e\n\nSince e is in units of coulombs and the energy is in electron volts, we can directly divide the energy by the elementary charge to find the potential difference in volts:\n\nV = 4.9 V\n\nSo, the minimum accelerating potential difference required in the Franck-Hertz experiment to produce the first excited state of mercury atoms is 4.9 volts."
