    "message_2": "W' and Z' bosons are hypothetical particles that are predicted to exist in certain extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as those based on grand unified theories (GUTs) or models with extra dimensions. These particles are expected to be heavier versions of the well-known W and Z bosons, which are responsible for the weak nuclear force.\n\nThe predicted properties of W' and Z' bosons differ from those of the standard W and Z bosons in several ways:\n\n1. Mass: W' and Z' bosons are expected to be significantly heavier than the standard W and Z bosons. While the masses of W and Z bosons are around 80.4 GeV/c² and 91.2 GeV/c², respectively, the masses of W' and Z' bosons could be in the range of hundreds of GeV/c² to several TeV/c², depending on the specific model.\n\n2. Couplings: The couplings of W' and Z' bosons to other particles could be different from those of the standard W and Z bosons. In some models, they might couple more strongly to certain quarks or leptons, leading to different decay patterns and production rates.\n\n3. Chirality: The W' and Z' bosons might have different chirality properties compared to the W and Z bosons. For example, they could couple preferentially to left-handed or right-handed particles, which would affect their interactions and decay processes.\n\n4. Additional decay channels: W' and Z' bosons could have additional decay channels not present for the standard W and Z bosons. For instance, they might decay into particles not included in the Standard Model, such as supersymmetric particles or particles from extra dimensions.\n\nTo detect the W' and Z' bosons experimentally, physicists typically search for their production and decay in high-energy particle collisions, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The key signatures of W' and Z' bosons would be:\n\n1. High-mass resonances: The production of W' and Z' bosons would show up as resonances (peaks) in the invariant mass distributions of their decay products, at masses much higher than those of the standard W and Z bosons.\n\n2. Unusual decay patterns: The decays of W' and Z' bosons could lead to unusual combinations of particles in the final state, which would not be expected from the decays of the standard W and Z bosons or other known processes.\n\n3. Anomalous production rates: If the couplings of W' and Z' bosons to other particles are different from those of the standard W and Z bosons, this could result in different production rates for certain processes, which could be detected as deviations from the Standard Model predictions.\n\n4. Chirality-sensitive observables: If the W' and Z' bosons have different chirality properties, this could be detected through the measurement of chirality-sensitive observables, such as angular distributions or polarization asymmetries in their decays.\n\nSo far, no evidence for W' and Z' bosons has been found in the data collected at the LHC or other experiments. However, the search for these particles continues, as their discovery would provide crucial insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model."
