    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance from the binary system to Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 15 solar masses = 15 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.984 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance from the binary system to Earth from megaparsecs (Mpc) to meters. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10^16 meters, so:\n\n10 Mpc = 10 * 10^6 parsecs = 10 * 10^6 * 3.086 x 10^16 meters = 3.086 x 10^22 meters\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nh = (4 * (6.674 x 10^-11)^2 * (1.989 x 10^31) * (2.984 x 10^31)) / ((2.998 x 10^8)^4 * (3.086 x 10^22))\n\nh â‰ˆ 1.24 x 10^-23\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system at a distance of 10 Mpc from Earth is approximately 1.24 x 10^-23."
