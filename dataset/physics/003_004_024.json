    "message_1": "A circular loop of radius 10 cm carries a current of 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the loop on its axis. (Assume that the current flows in a clockwise direction when viewed from above the loop.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the circular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nGiven:\nI = 2 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nx = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * 0.001953125 m³)\n\nB ≈ 6.4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the center of the loop on its axis is approximately 6.4 × 10^(-6) T."
