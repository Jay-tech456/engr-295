    "message_2": "To estimate the expected number of gravitational wave detections in the next decade, we need to consider the current detection rate and the improvements in sensitivity that future observatories will bring. \n\nAs of now, the LIGO and Virgo observatories have detected over 50 gravitational wave events since their first detection in 2015. The majority of these events are binary black hole mergers, with a few binary neutron star mergers and one possible black hole-neutron star merger. The current detection rate is roughly 10-20 events per year.\n\nIn the next decade, the sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories is expected to improve significantly. The LIGO and Virgo observatories will undergo upgrades, and new observatories such as KAGRA in Japan and LIGO-India will join the global network. These improvements will increase the detection volume and the ability to pinpoint the location of the sources in the sky.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can make a rough estimate of the expected number of gravitational wave detections in the next decade. If we assume a conservative detection rate of 20 events per year currently and expect this rate to double due to the improvements in sensitivity and the addition of new observatories, we could have around 40 events detected per year.\n\nOver a decade, this would result in approximately 400 gravitational wave detections. However, this is a rough estimate and depends on various factors such as the actual rate of mergers in the universe, the sensitivity of the observatories, and the duration of their observation runs. The actual number of detections could be higher or lower than this estimate."
