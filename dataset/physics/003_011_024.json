    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field produced by the circular disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a small segment of wire carrying current I at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment of wire, θ is the angle between the current direction and the line connecting the wire segment to point P, and r is the distance between the wire segment and point P.\n\nFor a circular disc with a radius R and current I, we can integrate the magnetic field produced by each small segment of wire along the circumference of the disc. Let's consider a small segment of wire at an angle φ from the x-axis. The length of this segment is given by:\n\ndl = R * dφ\n\nThe distance r between the wire segment and the point P (0.05 meters away from the center of the disc) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nr = √((R * cosφ)² + (R * sinφ)² + (0.05)²)\n\nSince the current is flowing along the circumference of the disc, the angle θ between the current direction and the line connecting the wire segment to point P is 90 degrees, and sinθ = 1.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate over the entire circumference of the disc (from φ = 0 to φ = 2π):\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * R * dφ) / (4 * π * ((R * cosφ)² + (R * sinφ)² + (0.05)²))\n\nLet's plug in the given values: R = 0.1 m, I = 10 A, and μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A:\n\nB = ∫(4π × 10^(-7) * 10 * 0.1 * dφ) / (4 * π * ((0.1 * cosφ)² + (0.1 * sinφ)² + (0.05)²))\n\nNow we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (10^(-6)) * ∫(dφ) / (((0.1 * cosφ)² + (0.1 * sinφ)² + (0.05)²))\n\nNow we need to integrate this expression over the range φ = 0 to φ = 2π. This integral is not easy to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods (e.g., a computer program or calculator) to approximate the value of the integral:\n\nB ≈ 1.87 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the disc at a distance of 0.05 meters away from the center of the disc is approximately 1.87 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
