    "message_2": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They are different from the black holes that form from the collapse of massive stars. Some theories suggest that primordial black holes could be a candidate for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nTheoretical predictions for the amount of dark matter produced by primordial black holes depend on various factors, such as the initial mass distribution of PBHs and the density fluctuations in the early universe. If a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of PBHs, their mass should be within a specific range to satisfy observational constraints.\n\nCurrent observational constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the universe come from various sources, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure formation, and gravitational lensing. These observations provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and help to constrain its properties.\n\nComparing theoretical predictions for PBHs as dark matter candidates with observational constraints, we find that PBHs can only account for a small fraction of the total dark matter content. For example, microlensing surveys have placed stringent limits on the abundance of PBHs with masses between 10^-8 and 10 solar masses. Similarly, constraints from the CMB and large-scale structure formation rule out PBHs with masses greater than 100 solar masses as the dominant component of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while primordial black holes could potentially contribute to the dark matter content of the universe, current theoretical predictions and observational constraints suggest that they are unlikely to account for the majority of dark matter. Other dark matter candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions, remain more plausible explanations for the observed abundance of dark matter in the universe."
