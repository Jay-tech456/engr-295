    "message_1": "A student performs a double-slit interference experiment with a red laser (630 nm) and a separation between the slits of 0.1 mm. The interference pattern is observed 2.0 m away from the slits on a screen. Calculate the distance between the central bright fringes on the screen.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the central bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the double-slit interference pattern:\n\nΔy = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\nΔy = distance between the central bright fringes (m)\nm = order of the bright fringe (1 for the first bright fringe on either side of the central maximum)\nλ = wavelength of the light (630 nm = 630 * 10^(-9) m)\nL = distance between the slits and the screen (2.0 m)\nd = separation between the slits (0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔy = (1 * 630 * 10^(-9) * 2.0) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nΔy = (1260 * 10^(-9)) / (10^(-4))\nΔy = 0.0126 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central bright fringes on the screen is 0.0126 meters or 12.6 millimeters."
