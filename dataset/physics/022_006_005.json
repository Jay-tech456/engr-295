    "message_2": "The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in shaping the rotation curve of galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity of an object depends on the mass enclosed within its orbit and its distance from the center of mass.\n\nIn the case of galaxies, if only the visible (normal) matter were present, we would expect the rotation curve to show a decrease in orbital velocity with increasing distance from the center, similar to the behavior of planets in our solar system. This is because the majority of the visible mass (stars, gas, and dust) is concentrated in the central regions of galaxies, and the gravitational force exerted by this mass decreases with distance.\n\nHowever, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show a different behavior. Instead of decreasing, the orbital velocities of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies remain relatively constant or even slightly increase with distance from the center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter alone led to the hypothesis of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. However, it does interact gravitationally with normal matter, and its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of visible matter in galaxies. The distribution of dark matter in galaxies is believed to form a roughly spherical halo that extends well beyond the visible disk of the galaxy.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter and normal matter affects the rotation curve of galaxies by modifying the gravitational potential in which the visible matter moves. The additional mass provided by the dark matter halo increases the gravitational force experienced by stars and gas in the outer regions of the galaxy, causing their orbital velocities to remain relatively constant or even slightly increase with distance from the center. This results in the observed flat or slowly rising rotation curves that are characteristic of spiral galaxies.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in shaping the rotation curve of galaxies by providing additional gravitational force that keeps the orbital velocities of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies relatively constant or even slightly increasing with distance from the center. This behavior is a strong indication of the presence of dark matter in galaxies and its significant contribution to their overall mass and gravitational potential."
