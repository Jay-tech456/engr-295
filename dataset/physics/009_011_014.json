    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first use the lensmaker's equation to find the radii of curvature of the lens, and then use the lens formula to find the position and size of the image formed.\n\nThe lensmaker's equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens. Since it's a convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and n = 1.5. Plugging these values into the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/20 = (1.5 - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\n1/20 = 0.5(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nNow, let's assume that the lens is symmetric, which means that the magnitudes of R1 and R2 are equal (R1 = -R2). This simplifies the equation to:\n\n1/20 = 0.5(1/R1 + 1/R1)\n\n1/20 = 0.5(2/R1)\n\n1/20 = 1/R1\n\nR1 = 20 cm\n\nSince R1 = -R2, R2 = -20 cm.\n\nNow that we have the radii of curvature, we can use the lens formula to find the position and size of the image formed:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and u = 30 cm. Plugging these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo find v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(30 + 20v) / (20 * 30) = (30 + v) / (20 * v)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n30 + 20v = 30v + v^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nv^2 - 10v = 0\n\nFactor out v:\n\nv(v - 10) = 0\n\nThe possible values for v are 0 and 10 cm. Since v cannot be 0, the image distance is v = 10 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image formed. The magnification (M) of the lens is given by:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -10/30\n\nM = -1/3\n\nThe magnification is -1/3, which means the image is inverted and 1/3 the size of the object."
