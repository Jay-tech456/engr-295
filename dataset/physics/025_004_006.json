    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG° is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nThe reaction quotient (Q) is given by the ratio of the product concentration to the substrate concentration:\n\nQ = [Product] / [Substrate]\n\nIn this case, the initial concentration of substrate is 2 mM (0.002 mol/L) and the initial concentration of product is 0 mM (0 mol/L). Therefore, Q = 0 / 0.002 = 0.\n\nHowever, since the natural logarithm of 0 is undefined, we need to consider that the reaction has not yet reached equilibrium and the product concentration is very close to 0, but not exactly 0. Let's assume the product concentration is a very small value, such as 1 x 10^-9 M.\n\nNow, we can calculate Q:\n\nQ = (1 x 10^-9) / 0.002 = 5 x 10^-10\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\nΔG = -20,000 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(298 K) ln(5 x 10^-10)\n\nΔG ≈ -20,000 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(298 K) (-25.8)\nΔG ≈ -20,000 J/mol - 63,900 J/mol\nΔG ≈ -83,900 J/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is approximately -83,900 J/mol."
