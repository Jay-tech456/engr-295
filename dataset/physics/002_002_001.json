    "message_1": "What is the amount of heat transferred when a 2 kg block of copper at 100°C is placed in contact with a 3 kg block of brass at 20°C? The specific heat capacity of copper is 385 J/kg°C and that of brass is 385 J/kg°C. The final temperature of the mixture is 40°C. Determine the heat transferred between the two blocks.",
    "message_2": "To determine the heat transferred between the two blocks, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the heat gained by the brass block (Q_brass):\n\nm_brass = 3 kg\nc_brass = 385 J/kg°C\nΔT_brass = T_final - T_initial_brass = 40°C - 20°C = 20°C\n\nQ_brass = m_brass * c_brass * ΔT_brass\nQ_brass = 3 kg * 385 J/kg°C * 20°C\nQ_brass = 23100 J\n\nNow, let's find the heat lost by the copper block (Q_copper):\n\nm_copper = 2 kg\nc_copper = 385 J/kg°C\nΔT_copper = T_initial_copper - T_final = 100°C - 40°C = 60°C\n\nQ_copper = m_copper * c_copper * ΔT_copper\nQ_copper = 2 kg * 385 J/kg°C * 60°C\nQ_copper = 46200 J\n\nSince the heat gained by the brass block is equal to the heat lost by the copper block, the heat transferred between the two blocks is:\n\nQ_transferred = Q_brass = Q_copper\nQ_transferred = 23100 J"
