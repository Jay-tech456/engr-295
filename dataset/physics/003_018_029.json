    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axial line of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given that there are 15 turns per centimeter, so we need to convert this to turns per meter:\n\nn = 15 turns/cm * (100 cm/m) = 1500 turns/m\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1500 turns/m) * (2.5 A)\nB_inside ≈ 4.71 × 10^(-3) T\n\nHowever, we need to find the magnetic field at a point 7 cm away from the center of the helix on its axial line. To do this, we can use the formula for the magnetic field on the axis of a solenoid:\n\nB_axis = (B_inside / 2) * (1 + (x^2 / (x^2 + R^2))^(3/2))\n\nwhere B_axis is the magnetic field on the axis, x is the distance from the center of the solenoid, and R is the radius of the solenoid.\n\nWe are given that x = 7 cm and R = 5 cm. We need to convert these values to meters:\n\nx = 7 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.07 m\nR = 5 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.05 m\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field at the point on the axial line:\n\nB_axis = (4.71 × 10^(-3) T / 2) * (1 + (0.07^2 / (0.07^2 + 0.05^2))^(3/2))\nB_axis ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-3) T * (1 + (0.0049 / (0.0049 + 0.0025))^(3/2))\nB_axis ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-3) T * (1 + (0.0049 / 0.0074)^(3/2))\nB_axis ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-3) T * (1 + 0.6622^(3/2))\nB_axis ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-3) T * (1 + 0.9079)\nB_axis ≈ 2.355 × 10^(-3) T * 1.9079\nB_axis ≈ 4.49 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 7 cm away from the center of the helix on its axial line is approximately 4.49 × 10^(-3) T."
