    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 4 cm away from the resistor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 2.5 A and r = 4 cm = 0.04 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.08\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 4 cm away from the resistor is 2.5 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (which is flowing straight through the center of the resistor), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the orientation of the wire and the direction of the current."
