    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the binding of a protein and ligand at 25°C, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(Kᵇ)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K), and Kᵇ is the equilibrium constant (1.5).\n\nΔG = -(8.314 J/mol·K) × (298.15 K) × ln(1.5)\n\nΔG ≈ -3.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the binding of a protein and ligand at 25°C is approximately -3.7 kJ/mol."
