    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves are influenced by the properties of the sources generating them. In the case of neutron stars, their compactness (mass-to-radius ratio) can have an impact on the gravitational waves produced during events such as mergers or instabilities.\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of gravitational waves is directly related to the mass and compactness of the objects involved. For a given mass, a more compact neutron star (higher mass-to-radius ratio) would lead to a stronger gravitational field, which in turn would result in a higher amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves. This is because the spacetime curvature around the neutron star is more pronounced, leading to a larger strain in the fabric of spacetime as the neutron star undergoes dynamical processes.\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of gravitational waves is determined by the orbital or dynamical timescales of the system. For a binary system of neutron stars, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves is related to the orbital frequency of the system. As the compactness of the neutron stars increases, the orbital separation between them decreases for a fixed total mass, leading to a higher orbital frequency. Consequently, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves will also increase.\n\nIn summary, the compactness of a neutron star can affect both the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves it produces. A higher mass-to-radius ratio generally leads to an increase in the amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as the spin and eccentricity of the orbit, can also influence the properties of the gravitational waves."
