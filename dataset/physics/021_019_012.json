    "message_2": "There is growing evidence that suggests black holes may be a source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which are particles with energies exceeding 10^18 electron volts. The evidence comes from both observational and theoretical studies.\n\n1. Observational evidence:\na) The Pierre Auger Observatory, which is dedicated to studying UHECRs, has detected cosmic rays with energies above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit. This limit is the theoretical energy threshold beyond which cosmic rays should lose energy through interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation. The presence of cosmic rays above this limit suggests that their sources must be relatively nearby, within about 100 Mpc.\n\nb) Astronomers have observed that the distribution of UHECR arrival directions is not uniform across the sky. Instead, there is a correlation between the arrival directions of UHECRs and the locations of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are powered by supermassive black holes. This correlation suggests that AGNs, and by extension, black holes, may be the sources of UHECRs.\n\n2. Theoretical evidence:\na) Black holes are known to produce powerful jets of particles and radiation, which are thought to be powered by the extraction of energy from the black hole's rotation. These jets can accelerate particles to extremely high energies, making them a plausible source of UHECRs.\n\nb) In the vicinity of a black hole, strong magnetic fields can be generated, which can also accelerate charged particles to ultra-high energies. This process, known as Fermi acceleration, could potentially produce UHECRs.\n\nc) Another possible mechanism involves the acceleration of particles in the accretion disk around a black hole. The turbulence and magnetic fields in the disk can lead to the formation of shocks, which can also accelerate particles to ultra-high energies.\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggesting that black holes may be a source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays comes from the detection of cosmic rays above the GZK limit, the correlation between UHECR arrival directions and the locations of active galactic nuclei, and the theoretical understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms in the vicinity of black holes."
