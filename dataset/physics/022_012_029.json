    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures like clusters of galaxies and superclusters. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it exerts gravitational forces on visible matter, influencing the formation and growth of cosmic structures.\n\nHere are some ways in which the distribution of dark matter affects the formation and evolution of cosmic structures:\n\n1. Initial fluctuations: In the early universe, dark matter formed the backbone of the cosmic web due to small fluctuations in its density. These fluctuations grew over time due to gravitational forces, eventually leading to the formation of dark matter halos. These halos then attracted visible matter, such as gas and dust, which led to the formation of galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter's gravitational influence can bend the path of light from distant galaxies, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. By studying the lensing effects, astronomers can map the distribution of dark matter and better understand its role in the formation of cosmic structures.\n\n3. Galaxy clusters and superclusters: Dark matter halos provide the gravitational glue that holds galaxy clusters and superclusters together. The distribution of dark matter determines the overall mass and size of these structures, as well as their rate of growth over time.\n\n4. Filamentary structure: The distribution of dark matter forms a cosmic web-like structure, with dense regions connected by filaments of dark matter. These filaments act as bridges, funneling visible matter and dark matter between galaxy clusters and superclusters, driving their growth and evolution.\n\n5. Dark matter and galaxy formation: The distribution of dark matter also influences the properties of individual galaxies, such as their size, shape, and rate of star formation. Galaxies that form within more massive dark matter halos tend to be larger and have higher rates of star formation than those in less massive halos.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter is a key factor in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures like clusters of galaxies and superclusters. Its gravitational influence shapes the overall structure of the universe and drives the growth of these massive structures over time."
