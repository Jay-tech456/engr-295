    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp). We know the speed of the electron (v) is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s. To find the momentum, we can use the formula:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron, which is approximately 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.\n\np = (9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg) * (1.5 × 10^6 m/s)\np ≈ 1.3664 × 10^-24 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nSince we want to find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx), we can assume that the inequality becomes an equality:\n\nΔp = ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nNow, we can solve for Δx:\n\nΔx = ħ/(2 * Δp)\n\nWe already know the value of ħ, so we can plug it in:\n\nΔx = (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1.3664 × 10^-24 kg m/s)\nΔx ≈ 3.854 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) is approximately 3.854 × 10^-11 m, and the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is approximately 1.3664 × 10^-24 kg m/s."
