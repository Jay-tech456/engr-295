    "message_2": "To find the distance between the atoms in a material, we can use Bragg's Law, which relates the scattering angle, wavelength, and interatomic distance in a crystal lattice. Bragg's Law is given by:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer (usually 1 for the first-order reflection), λ is the wavelength of the neutron beam, d is the interatomic distance, and θ is half of the scattering angle.\n\nIn this case, the scattering angle is 60°, so θ = 30°. The wavelength λ is given as 1.5 Å. We will assume n = 1 for the first-order reflection. Plugging these values into Bragg's Law:\n\n1 * 1.5 Å = 2d * sin(30°)\n\n1.5 Å = 2d * 0.5\n\n1.5 Å = d\n\nSo, the distance between the atoms in the material is 1.5 Å."
