    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy of the electron, we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) using the given formula:\n\nγ = 1/√(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nHere, v = 0.6c (speed of the electron) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1/√(1 - (0.6c/c)^2)\nγ = 1/√(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1/√(0.64)\nγ = 1/0.8\nγ = 1.25\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the relativistic kinetic energy (K) using the formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nHere, m = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg (rest mass of the electron) and c is the speed of light.\n\nK = (1.25 - 1)(9.11 × 10^-31 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK = 0.25(9.11 × 10^-31 kg)(9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK = 2.2775 × 10^-30 kg m^2/s^2\n\nThe relativistic energy of the electron is approximately 2.28 × 10^-30 Joules."
