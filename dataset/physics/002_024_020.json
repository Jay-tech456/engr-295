Given that the heat of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol and the vapor pressure of water at 100°C is 101.3 kPa, calculate the boiling point of water using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.",
    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure of a substance at different temperatures, taking into account the heat of vaporization. The equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nAt sea level (0 meters), the boiling point of water is 100°C (373.15 K), and the vapor pressure is 101.3 kPa. At an altitude of 2,500 meters, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means the boiling point of water will also be lower. We need to find the temperature (T2) at which the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure at 2,500 meters.\n\nFirst, let's find the atmospheric pressure at 2,500 meters. We can use the barometric formula:\n\nP = P0 * exp(-Mgh/RT)\n\nwhere P is the pressure at altitude, P0 is the pressure at sea level (101.3 kPa), M is the molar mass of air (0.029 kg/mol), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), h is the altitude (2,500 meters), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature (assumed to be constant at 288.15 K, approximately 15°C).\n\nP = 101.3 kPa * exp(-0.029 kg/mol * 9.81 m/s² * 2500 m / (8.314 J/mol·K * 288.15 K))\nP ≈ 75.1 kPa\n\nNow we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the boiling point of water at this pressure:\n\nln(75.1 kPa / 101.3 kPa) = -40.7 kJ/mol / (8.314 J/mol·K) * (1/T2 - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for T2:\n\n1/T2 = 1/373.15 K + ln(75.1 kPa / 101.3 kPa) * (8.314 J/mol·K) / (-40.7 kJ/mol)\n1/T2 ≈ 0.002678 K^(-1)\n\nT2 ≈ 373.15 K / (1 + 0.002678 * 373.15)\nT2 ≈ 366.65 K\n\nThe boiling point of water at an altitude of 2,500 meters is approximately 366.65 K, or 93.5°C."
