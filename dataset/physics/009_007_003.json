    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 20 cm, u = 30 cm\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator, which is 60:\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 2/60 from both sides:\n\n1/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nSo, the image distance from the lens is 60 cm.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object."
