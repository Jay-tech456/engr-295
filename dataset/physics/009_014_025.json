    "message_2": "To find the maximum deviation angle of red and violet light passing through a prism, we need to use Snell's Law and the formula for the deviation angle. Snell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(i2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and i1 and i2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor red light, the refractive index is approximately 1.517, and for violet light, it is approximately 1.523. The refractive index of air is 1. Let's first find the angle of refraction for both red and violet light.\n\n1 * sin(45°) = 1.517 * sin(i2_red)\nsin(i2_red) = sin(45°) / 1.517\ni2_red ≈ 28.97°\n\n1 * sin(45°) = 1.523 * sin(i2_violet)\nsin(i2_violet) = sin(45°) / 1.523\ni2_violet ≈ 28.87°\n\nNow, let's find the angle of emergence (e) using the formula:\n\nA = i2 - e\n\nwhere A is the prism angle (60°). We can rearrange the formula to find e:\n\ne_red = i2_red - A\ne_red ≈ 28.97° - 60°\ne_red ≈ -31.03°\n\ne_violet = i2_violet - A\ne_violet ≈ 28.87° - 60°\ne_violet ≈ -31.13°\n\nThe deviation angle (D) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = i1 + e - A\n\nD_red = 45° + (-31.03°) - 60°\nD_red ≈ -46.03°\n\nD_violet = 45° + (-31.13°) - 60°\nD_violet ≈ -46.13°\n\nThe maximum deviation angle for red light is approximately 46.03°, and for violet light, it is approximately 46.13°.\n\nNow, let's calculate the angular dispersion produced by the prism. Angular dispersion (ΔD) is the difference between the deviation angles of the two colors:\n\nΔD = D_violet - D_red\nΔD ≈ -46.13° - (-46.03°)\nΔD ≈ -0.1°\n\nThe angular dispersion produced by the prism is approximately 0.1°.\n\nFinally, let's find the linear dispersion (d) at a distance of 15 cm from the prism. We can use the formula:\n\nd = L * tan(ΔD)\n\nwhere L is the distance between the incident ray and emergent ray (15 cm).\n\nd = 15 cm * tan(-0.1°)\nd ≈ -0.026 cm\n\nThe linear dispersion at a distance of 15 cm from the prism is approximately -0.026 cm."
