    "message_1": "In the context of quantum teleportation, what is the maximum distance over which entangled qubits can be reliably transmitted without significant decoherence, and what are the factors that limit this distance? How does this distance compare to the current state-of-the-art in practical quantum communication and computing systems?",
    "message_2": "The maximum distance over which entangled qubits can be reliably transmitted without significant decoherence depends on several factors, including the quality of the entangled qubits, the transmission medium, and the error-correction techniques employed. In general, the distance is limited by factors such as loss and noise in the transmission medium, which can cause decoherence and reduce the fidelity of the entangled state.\n\nIn fiber-optic cables, the maximum distance achieved for quantum teleportation is around 100 kilometers. However, free-space quantum communication, such as between ground stations and satellites, has demonstrated successful entanglement distribution over distances of up to 1,200 kilometers. This was achieved in 2017 by the Chinese satellite Micius, which established entangled photon pairs between ground stations.\n\nThe current state-of-the-art in practical quantum communication and computing systems is still in its early stages. Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, which use entangled photons to securely exchange encryption keys, have been deployed over distances of around 100 kilometers in fiber-optic networks. However, these systems are not yet widely used due to their high cost and limited range.\n\nTo increase the range of quantum communication, researchers are working on developing quantum repeaters, which can extend the distance over which entangled qubits can be transmitted without significant decoherence. Quantum repeaters work by entangling qubits at intermediate nodes, allowing for the creation of long-distance entangled states. However, building practical quantum repeaters remains a significant challenge due to the need for efficient quantum memories and error-correction techniques.\n\nIn summary, the maximum distance for reliable quantum teleportation is currently limited to around 100 kilometers in fiber-optic cables and up to 1,200 kilometers in free-space communication. This is still far from being widely practical for quantum communication and computing systems, but ongoing research into quantum repeaters and error-correction techniques may help to extend these distances in the future."
