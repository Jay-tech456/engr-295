    "message_2": "The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the collision of two neutron stars depend on the masses and distance of the neutron stars, as well as their orbital parameters. To give a rough estimate, we can use the following formula for the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8) * (M_chirp)^(5/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, t is the time until coalescence, and M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system, which is a combination of the individual masses of the neutron stars.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves can be estimated using:\n\nA = (G * M_chirp / (c^2 * d))^5/4 * (c / (G * M_chirp))^(1/4)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude and d is the distance to the binary system.\n\nFor a more accurate calculation, we would need specific values for the masses, distance, and orbital parameters of the neutron stars.\n\nAs for the time delay, gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, so the time it takes for them to reach Earth depends on the distance between the neutron stars and Earth. The time delay can be calculated using:\n\nt_delay = d / c\n\nwhere t_delay is the time delay, d is the distance between the neutron stars and Earth, and c is the speed of light.\n\nTo compare the expected time delay with current observation data, we would need to know the specific values for the distance to the observed neutron star collision. For example, the first observed neutron star merger, GW170817, was detected at a distance of about 130 million light-years from Earth. The gravitational waves took approximately 130 million years to reach Earth, which is consistent with the speed of light and the distance to the source."
