    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays from an object do not converge at a single point after reflecting off a spherical mirror. This is due to the difference in focal lengths for rays that are closer to the mirror's axis (paraxial rays) and those that are farther away (marginal rays). \n\nTo determine the spherical aberration, we need to find the difference in focal lengths for paraxial and marginal rays. \n\nFirst, let's find the focal length for paraxial rays (f_paraxial) using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f_paraxial = (1/R) * (2 - (D^2 / 16 * R^2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature (10 cm) and D is the diameter of the mirror (6 cm).\n\n1/f_paraxial = (1/10) * (2 - (6^2 / 16 * 10^2))\n1/f_paraxial = 0.1 * (2 - (36 / 1600))\n1/f_paraxial = 0.1 * (2 - 0.0225)\n1/f_paraxial = 0.1 * 1.9775\nf_paraxial = 1 / (0.19775) ≈ 5.05 cm\n\nNow, let's find the focal length for marginal rays (f_marginal) using the mirror equation for marginal rays:\n\n1/f_marginal = (1/R) * (2 - (D^2 / 4 * R^2))\n\n1/f_marginal = (1/10) * (2 - (6^2 / 4 * 10^2))\n1/f_marginal = 0.1 * (2 - (36 / 400))\n1/f_marginal = 0.1 * (2 - 0.09)\n1/f_marginal = 0.1 * 1.91\nf_marginal = 1 / (0.191) ≈ 5.24 cm\n\nNow, we can find the spherical aberration by finding the difference between the focal lengths:\n\nSpherical aberration = |f_marginal - f_paraxial|\nSpherical aberration = |5.24 cm - 5.05 cm|\nSpherical aberration ≈ 0.19 cm\n\nThe spherical aberration of the mirror for incident light with a wavelength of 500 nm is approximately 0.19 cm."
