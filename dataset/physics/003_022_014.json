    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular coil:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2 A\nN = 100 turns\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A * 100) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁶ Tm * 100) / 0.2 m\n\nB = (800π × 10⁻⁶ T) / 0.2\n\nB ≈ 12.57 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is approximately 12.57 × 10⁻⁴ T or 1.257 × 10⁻³ T."
