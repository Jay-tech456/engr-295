    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\n- θ is the mixing angle between the two neutrino flavors\n- Δm² is the difference in the squared masses of the two neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²)\n- L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km)\n- E is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV)\n\nFor atmospheric neutrinos, we can use the following values from the PMNS matrix:\n- sin²(2θ) ≈ 0.99 (mixing angle between νμ and ντ)\n- Δm² ≈ 2.5 x 10⁻³ eV² (mass squared difference between ν₂ and ν₃)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given distance (L = 500 km) and solve for the probability:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = 0.99 * sin²(1.27 * 2.5 x 10⁻³ * 500 / E)\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for the neutrino energy (E), we cannot provide a numerical value for the probability. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the probability for any given neutrino energy."
