    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor with a radius of 0.5 cm and an outer conductor with a radius of 1.0 cm. If a current of 2.5 A flows through the inner conductor, calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value of 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nSince the distance of 0.8 cm is between the inner and outer conductors, we only need to consider the current flowing through the inner conductor, which is 2.5 A.\n\nFirst, convert the distance from cm to meters: 0.8 cm = 0.008 m\n\nNow, plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2π * 0.008 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) Tm * 2.5 A) / (0.008 m)\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-6) T / 0.008 m\n\nB ≈ 3.125 × 10^(-4) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 cm from the center of the cable is approximately 3.125 × 10^(-4) T (tesla)."
