    "message_2": "The critical mass of a protostar undergoing gravitational contraction in a molecular cloud can be determined using the Jeans mass, which is the minimum mass required for a region in a molecular cloud to collapse under its own gravity and form a star. The Jeans mass (M_J) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nM_J = (5 * k * T * (3/4πρ)^0.5) / (G * μ * m_H)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K), T is the temperature (10^6 K), ρ is the density of the molecular cloud, G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N m²/kg²), μ is the mean molecular weight (assumed to be 2 for a hydrogen-dominated gas), and m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 × 10^-27 kg).\n\nThe density of a molecular cloud can vary significantly, so we'll need to make an assumption about the density to calculate the Jeans mass. Let's assume a typical density of 10^4 hydrogen molecules per cm³, which is equivalent to 1.67 × 10^-21 kg/m³.\n\nPlugging these values into the Jeans mass formula, we get:\n\nM_J = (5 * 1.38 × 10^-23 * 10^6 * (3/4π * 1.67 × 10^-21)^0.5) / (6.67 × 10^-11 * 2 * 1.67 × 10^-27)\n\nM_J ≈ 1.8 × 10^34 kg\n\nThis is roughly 90 times the mass of the Sun (M_sun ≈ 2 × 10^30 kg). However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual critical mass can vary depending on the specific conditions in the molecular cloud.\n\nThe critical mass of a protostar affects its eventual fate and life cycle. Stars with masses below the critical mass will not have enough pressure and temperature at their cores to ignite nuclear fusion, and they will become brown dwarfs. Stars with masses above the critical mass will ignite nuclear fusion and become main-sequence stars, with their life cycle and eventual fate determined by their mass. Lower-mass stars (like our Sun) will eventually become red giants and then white dwarfs, while higher-mass stars will undergo more dramatic events like supernovae and potentially form neutron stars or black holes."
