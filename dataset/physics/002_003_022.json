    "message_1": "A certain gas is expanded by an external pressure of 2 atm from an initial volume of 2.5 L to a final volume of 7.5 L. If the initial internal energy of the gas is 1250 J and the work done during the expansion is 750 J, calculate the final internal energy of the gas.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the final internal energy of the gas, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (∆U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W).\n\n∆U = Q - W\n\nWe are given the initial internal energy (U_initial) of the gas as 1250 J, and the work done during the expansion (W) as 750 J. We need to find the final internal energy (U_final) of the gas.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat added to the system (Q). Since we are not given any information about the heat transfer, we will assume that the process is adiabatic, meaning that no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. In an adiabatic process, Q = 0.\n\nNow we can use the first law of thermodynamics to find the change in internal energy:\n\n∆U = Q - W\n∆U = 0 - 750 J\n∆U = -750 J\n\nNow we can find the final internal energy of the gas:\n\nU_final = U_initial + ∆U\nU_final = 1250 J - 750 J\nU_final = 500 J\n\nThe final internal energy of the gas is 500 J."
