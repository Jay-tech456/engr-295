    "message_2": "To determine the nuclear spin (I) of an oxygen-17 nucleus, we need to consider the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus and their respective spins.\n\nOxygen-17 has 8 protons and 9 neutrons (17 - 8 = 9). Both protons and neutrons have a spin of 1/2. We need to determine the total spin of the nucleus by considering the pairing of nucleons (protons and neutrons).\n\nIn oxygen-17, there are 4 pairs of protons (8 protons in total) and 4 pairs of neutrons (8 out of 9 neutrons). These pairs have a total spin of 0, as the spins of the paired nucleons cancel each other out. There is one unpaired neutron left with a spin of 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the nuclear spin (I) of an oxygen-17 nucleus is 1/2."
