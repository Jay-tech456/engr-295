    "message_2": "The lifetime of an excited state can be calculated using the uncertainty principle, which relates the lifetime (τ) of the state to the natural linewidth (Δν) of the transition:\n\nΔE * τ ≈ h\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy uncertainty, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and τ is the lifetime of the state.\n\nThe energy uncertainty (ΔE) can be calculated from the natural linewidth (Δν) using the relation:\n\nΔE = h * Δν\n\nSubstituting the given value of the natural linewidth (3.3 x 10^8 Hz):\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.3 x 10^8 Hz) = 2.18658 x 10^-25 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the lifetime (τ) using the uncertainty principle:\n\nτ ≈ h / ΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.18658 x 10^-25 J) = 3.03 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of a helium atom in its 2p excited state is approximately 3.03 x 10^-9 seconds."
