    "message_2": "The critical temperature of a quark-gluon plasma is the temperature at which the transition from ordinary hadronic matter (protons, neutrons, and other hadrons) to a plasma of quarks and gluons occurs. This transition is called the quark-gluon plasma phase transition. The critical temperature is estimated to be around 150 to 170 MeV (million electron volts), which corresponds to approximately 1.7 to 2.0 trillion Kelvin (1.7 x 10^12 K to 2.0 x 10^12 K).\n\nAt temperatures below the critical temperature, quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons due to the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by the exchange of gluons. However, as the temperature increases and reaches the critical temperature, the strong nuclear force becomes weaker, and quarks and gluons are no longer confined within hadrons. Instead, they form a new state of matter called quark-gluon plasma.\n\nIn the quark-gluon plasma phase, the behavior and properties of the matter change significantly. The plasma behaves as a nearly perfect fluid with very low viscosity and displays collective behavior. This means that the quarks and gluons in the plasma move together coherently, rather than independently. Additionally, the quark-gluon plasma is highly opaque to particles, meaning that it is difficult for particles to pass through it.\n\nThe study of quark-gluon plasma is important for understanding the early universe, as it is believed that the universe was in a quark-gluon plasma state shortly after the Big Bang. This research also helps us understand the strong nuclear force and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. Experiments to create and study quark-gluon plasma are conducted at facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)."
