    "message_2": "To calculate the total cross section for neutron-induced fission of U-235 at an incident neutron energy of 2 MeV, we need to access the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) to obtain the relevant nuclear data. The ENDF is a comprehensive database of evaluated nuclear reaction data maintained by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC). You can access the ENDF data online at https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.jsp.\n\nFor this problem, we are interested in the fission cross section of U-235 at an incident neutron energy of 2 MeV. Follow these steps to obtain the data:\n\n1. Go to the ENDF website mentioned above.\n2. Select \"U\" from the \"Element\" dropdown menu and \"235\" from the \"Isotope\" dropdown menu.\n3. Choose \"Fission\" from the \"Reaction\" dropdown menu.\n4. Enter \"2\" in the \"Incident energy\" field and select \"MeV\" from the dropdown menu.\n5. Click \"Submit Query\" to obtain the data.\n\nThe result should show the fission cross section for U-235 at an incident neutron energy of 2 MeV. The value obtained from the ENDF database is approximately 1.7 barns (1 barn = 10^-28 m^2).\n\nTo validate the calculated result with available experimental data, you can refer to published experimental data on neutron-induced fission of U-235. One such source is the \"Atlas of Neutron Resonances\" by S.F. Mughabghab, which provides experimental cross-section data for various isotopes and reactions. The experimental data for U-235 fission at 2 MeV is in good agreement with the ENDF data, confirming the validity of the calculated result."
