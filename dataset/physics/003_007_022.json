    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.25 meters away from the rod, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a long straight current-carrying conductor, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (7.5 A), and r is the distance from the rod (0.25 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 7.5 A) / (2 * π * 0.25 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 7.5 A) / (2 * 0.25 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (3 × 10^(-6) T) / 0.5 m\n\nB = 6 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 0.25 meters away from the rod is 6 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
