    "message_2": "There is no theoretical limit to the maximum number of qubits that can be entangled in a single quantum state. However, in practice, the number of entangled qubits is limited by the technological constraints and the ability to maintain coherence among the qubits. As of now, quantum computers with around 50-70 qubits have been developed, but researchers are working on increasing this number.\n\nEntanglement is a key property that can be used in quantum communication and cryptography. One of the most well-known applications is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which allows two parties to share a secret key that can be used for secure communication. In QKD, entangled qubits are used to create correlations between the two parties, which can then be used to generate a shared secret key. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the communication, the entangled state will be disturbed, and the parties will be alerted to the presence of the eavesdropper.\n\nAnother application is quantum teleportation, which allows the transfer of quantum information from one location to another without physically transmitting the qubits themselves. This is achieved by using entangled qubits shared between the sender and the receiver. The sender performs a joint measurement on their qubit and the qubit to be teleported, and then sends the classical information obtained from the measurement to the receiver. The receiver can then use this information to reconstruct the original quantum state.\n\nThese applications, among others, demonstrate the potential of entangled qubits in quantum communication and cryptography, providing secure communication channels and novel ways to transmit information. As technology advances and the number of entangled qubits increases, we can expect even more powerful applications to emerge."
