    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°\n\nwhere ΔH° is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS° is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the entropy value from J/K•mol to kJ/K•mol:\n\nΔS° = -163.2 J/K•mol × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.1632 kJ/K•mol\n\nNow, we need to determine the temperature at which we want to calculate the Gibbs free energy change. Since the problem does not specify a temperature, we will assume standard conditions (298 K):\n\nT = 298 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = (-483.6 kJ/mol) - (298 K × -0.1632 kJ/K•mol)\n\nΔG° = -483.6 kJ/mol + (48.6344 kJ/mol)\n\nΔG° = -434.9656 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is approximately -434.97 kJ/mol."
