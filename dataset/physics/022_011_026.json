    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy or a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as another galaxy or a quasar. This bending of light is due to the gravitational pull of the massive object, which causes the light to follow a curved path.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, but it does have mass and therefore exerts a gravitational force. It is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe, and its presence in galaxies and galaxy clusters can greatly enhance the gravitational lensing effect.\n\nThe key differences in lensing features between a galaxy with dark matter and one without it are:\n\n1. Mass distribution: A galaxy with dark matter will have a more extended mass distribution, as dark matter is believed to form a halo around the visible matter in the galaxy. This extended mass distribution will lead to stronger gravitational lensing effects compared to a galaxy without dark matter.\n\n2. Lensing strength: Due to the additional mass contributed by dark matter, the overall lensing strength of a galaxy with dark matter will be stronger than that of a galaxy without it. This means that the light from more distant objects will be bent more significantly, leading to more pronounced lensing features such as arcs and multiple images of the background source.\n\n3. Radial profile of the lensing signal: The presence of dark matter can affect the radial profile of the lensing signal, which is the distribution of lensing strength as a function of distance from the center of the galaxy. In a galaxy with dark matter, the lensing signal is expected to be stronger at larger radii, reflecting the extended mass distribution of the dark matter halo.\n\n4. Substructure lensing: Dark matter is thought to form smaller substructures within the larger dark matter halo. These substructures can also act as lenses, causing additional lensing features such as flux ratio anomalies and astrometric shifts in the images of background sources. These features are less likely to be observed in a galaxy without dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in a galaxy can lead to stronger gravitational lensing effects, more extended mass distributions, and additional lensing features due to substructures within the dark matter halo. These differences can be used to study the properties of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies."
