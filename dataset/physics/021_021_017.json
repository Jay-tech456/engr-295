    "message_1": "How likely is it that black holes are the primary source of non-baryonic dark matter in the universe, and what evidence supports this possibility?",
    "message_2": "The likelihood that black holes are the primary source of non-baryonic dark matter in the universe is currently considered to be low. Non-baryonic dark matter is believed to be composed of particles that do not interact with electromagnetic radiation and are not made up of protons, neutrons, or electrons. Black holes, on the other hand, are formed from the gravitational collapse of massive stars and are composed of baryonic matter.\n\nThere are several lines of evidence that suggest black holes are not the primary source of non-baryonic dark matter:\n\n1. Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): The CMB is the radiation left over from the Big Bang, and its properties provide information about the composition of the universe. Measurements of the CMB indicate that about 85% of the total matter in the universe is non-baryonic dark matter, while only a small fraction is baryonic matter, which includes black holes.\n\n2. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of non-baryonic dark matter. Simulations of structure formation show that non-baryonic dark matter is necessary for the formation of the observed large-scale structures. If black holes were the primary source of dark matter, the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters would be different from what is observed.\n\n3. Gravitational lensing: Observations of gravitational lensing, where the path of light is bent by the presence of massive objects, provide further evidence for the existence of non-baryonic dark matter. The amount of lensing observed is consistent with the presence of non-baryonic dark matter, not black holes.\n\n4. Primordial black holes: Some researchers have proposed that primordial black holes, which would have formed in the early universe, could be a source of non-baryonic dark matter. However, current observational constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes suggest that they cannot account for the majority of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while black holes do contribute to the overall mass of the universe, they are not considered to be the primary source of non-baryonic dark matter. The evidence from the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure formation, and gravitational lensing supports the existence of non-baryonic dark matter, which is likely composed of yet-to-be-discovered particles."
