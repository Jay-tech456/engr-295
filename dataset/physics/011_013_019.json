If the number density of free electrons in copper is 8.5 x 10^28/m^3, calculate the electrical conductivity of copper.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nσ = n * e * μ\n\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the number density of free electrons, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), and μ is the electron mobility.\n\nFirst, we need to find the electron mobility (μ). We can use the formula:\n\nμ = J / (n * e * E)\n\nwhere J is the current density, E is the electric field, and n and e are the same as before.\n\nWe can find the current density (J) using Ohm's law:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere I is the current and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire.\n\nThe current (I) can be found using the formula:\n\nI = V / R\n\nwhere V is the voltage and R is the resistance of the wire.\n\nWe know the electric field (E) is 2 V/m, and the length of the wire (L) is 2 m. So, the voltage (V) across the wire is:\n\nV = E * L = 2 V/m * 2 m = 4 V\n\nNow, we need to find the resistance (R) of the wire. We can use the formula:\n\nR = ρ * L / A\n\nwhere ρ is the resistivity of copper, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire.\n\nThe resistivity (ρ) of copper is approximately 1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm. The cross-sectional area (A) of the wire can be found using the formula:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the wire (1 mm or 0.001 m). So,\n\nA = π * (0.001/2)^2 = π * (0.0005)^2 ≈ 7.85 x 10^-7 m^2\n\nNow, we can find the resistance (R) of the wire:\n\nR = ρ * L / A = (1.68 x 10^-8 Ωm) * (2 m) / (7.85 x 10^-7 m^2) ≈ 0.0428 Ω\n\nNow, we can find the current (I) in the wire:\n\nI = V / R = 4 V / 0.0428 Ω ≈ 93.46 A\n\nNow, we can find the current density (J):\n\nJ = I / A = 93.46 A / (7.85 x 10^-7 m^2) ≈ 1.19 x 10^8 A/m^2\n\nNow, we can find the electron mobility (μ):\n\nμ = J / (n * e * E) = (1.19 x 10^8 A/m^2) / ((8.5 x 10^28/m^3) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (2 V/m)) ≈ 4.61 x 10^-3 m^2/Vs\n\nFinally, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) of copper:\n\nσ = n * e * μ = (8.5 x 10^28/m^3) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (4.61 x 10^-3 m^2/Vs) ≈ 6.27 x 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of copper is approximately 6.27 x 10^7 S/m."
