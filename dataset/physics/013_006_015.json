    "message_2": "A Type Ia supernova is a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star in a binary system. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by a Type Ia supernova covers a wide range of energies, from radio waves to gamma rays. The energy distribution and its evolution over time can be divided into several phases.\n\n1. Early phase (first few hours to days): During the initial explosion, the supernova emits high-energy gamma rays and X-rays. The gamma-ray energies can be in the range of several hundred keV to a few MeV, while X-rays have energies in the range of 0.1 to 100 keV.\n\n2. Photospheric phase (days to weeks): As the supernova expands and cools, the peak of the emitted radiation shifts to lower energies. The majority of the emitted radiation is now in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical range, with energies between 1 eV and 10 eV. The optical light curve reaches its maximum brightness during this phase, which is used to classify Type Ia supernovae.\n\n3. Nebular phase (weeks to months): The supernova continues to expand and cool, and the peak of the emitted radiation shifts further to lower energies. The majority of the emitted radiation is now in the infrared (IR) range, with energies between 0.001 eV and 1 eV. The optical light curve declines during this phase, and the supernova becomes dominated by emission lines from various elements, such as iron, calcium, and oxygen.\n\n4. Late-time phase (months to years): The supernova continues to cool and fade, and the emitted radiation shifts to even lower energies. The majority of the emitted radiation is now in the radio range, with energies below 0.001 eV. The radio emission can last for several years and is powered by the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the surrounding interstellar medium.\n\nIn summary, the typical range of energies of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a Type Ia supernova spans from radio waves to gamma rays. The energy distribution evolves over time, with the peak of the emitted radiation shifting from high-energy gamma rays and X-rays in the early phase to lower-energy UV, optical, IR, and radio waves in the later phases."
