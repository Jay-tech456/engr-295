    "message_2": "The critical temperature of a substance is the temperature above which it cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied. For water, the critical temperature and critical pressure are related to each other.\n\nThe critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) of water are already known experimentally. The critical temperature of water is approximately 647.1 K (373.9°C), and its critical pressure is approximately 22.064 MPa.\n\nSince the given critical pressure is 22.1 MPa, which is very close to the known value of 22.064 MPa, we can assume that the critical temperature will also be very close to the known value of 647.1 K (373.9°C).\n\nSo, the critical temperature of water for the given critical pressure of 22.1 MPa is approximately 647.1 K (373.9°C)."
