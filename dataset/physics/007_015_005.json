    "message_2": "The mechanism that holds the nucleus of an atom together despite the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons is known as the strong nuclear force, also called the strong force or strong interaction. This force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak nuclear force.\n\nThe strong nuclear force is a short-range force that acts between protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, in the atomic nucleus. It is much stronger than the electrostatic repulsion between protons, but its range is limited to distances on the order of 1-3 femtometers (1 femtometer = 10^-15 meters). At these short distances, the strong nuclear force is attractive and powerful enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between protons, binding the nucleons together in the nucleus.\n\nThe strong nuclear force is mediated by the exchange of particles called gluons, which are massless and carry the strong force between quarks, the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons. This interaction between quarks is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is a component of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nIn addition to the strong nuclear force, there is another force called the residual strong force or nuclear force, which is a residual effect of the strong force acting between nucleons. This residual strong force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. It is also a short-range force, but its strength decreases more rapidly with distance compared to the strong force acting between quarks.\n\nIn summary, the strong nuclear force is the mechanism that holds the nucleus of an atom together despite the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons. It is a short-range force that acts between quarks within nucleons and is powerful enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion at short distances. The residual strong force, a consequence of the strong force, binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, ensuring the stability of atomic nuclei."
