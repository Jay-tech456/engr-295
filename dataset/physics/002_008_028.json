    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of water given that a 50 g sample of water is heated from 20°C to 50°C using 5,000 J of heat?",
    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Q = 5,000 J (heat energy)\n- m = 50 g (mass of water)\n- ΔT = 50°C - 20°C = 30°C (change in temperature)\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c). Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 5,000 J / (50 g × 30°C)\nc = 5,000 J / 1,500 g°C\nc = 3.33 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water in this case is approximately 3.33 J/g°C. Note that the generally accepted value for the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g°C, so this value is a bit lower than expected. This could be due to experimental error or other factors not accounted for in the problem."
