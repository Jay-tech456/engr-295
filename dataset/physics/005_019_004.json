    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the emitted light observed by an observer on the planet, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the observed frequency, f_emitted is the emitted frequency, v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, f_emitted = 5 x 10^14 Hz, v = 0.8c, and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nf_observed = (5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = (5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_observed = (5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = (5 x 10^14 Hz) * 3\n\nf_observed = 15 x 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the emitted light observed by an observer on the planet is 15 x 10^14 Hz."
