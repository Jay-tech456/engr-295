    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere:\nf_observed = frequency observed by the observer\nf_emitted = frequency of the emitted light (4.5 x 10^14 Hz)\nv = velocity of the light source relative to the observer (0.8c)\nc = speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the observed frequency:\n\nf_observed = (4.5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nf_observed = (4.5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(1.8 / 0.2)\n\nf_observed = (4.5 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(9)\n\nf_observed = (4.5 x 10^14 Hz) * 3\n\nf_observed = 13.5 x 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency observed by the observer is 13.5 x 10^14 Hz."
