    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of methane using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS), we first need to determine the compressibility factor (Z) and the fugacity coefficient (φ). The PR EOS is given by:\n\nP = (R * T) / (V - b) - a * α / (V^2 + 2 * b * V - b^2)\n\nwhere P is the pressure, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, V is the molar volume, a and b are the PR EOS parameters, and α is the temperature-dependent correction factor.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the PR EOS parameters a and b:\n\na = 0.45724 * (R^2 * Tc^2) / Pc\nb = 0.07780 * (R * Tc) / Pc\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature, and Pc is the critical pressure. The gas constant R in SI units is 8.314 J/(mol*K).\n\nFor methane, Tc = -82.59 °C = 190.56 K, and Pc = 4.6 MPa = 4.6 * 10^6 Pa.\n\na = 0.45724 * (8.314^2 * 190.56^2) / (4.6 * 10^6)\na ≈ 2.2839 J*m^3/mol^2\n\nb = 0.07780 * (8.314 * 190.56) / (4.6 * 10^6)\nb ≈ 2.9613 * 10^(-5) m^3/mol\n\nNext, we need to calculate the temperature-dependent correction factor α:\n\nα = (1 + m * (1 - sqrt(T/Tc)))^2\n\nwhere m is given by:\n\nm = 0.37464 + 1.54226 * ω - 0.26992 * ω^2\n\nFor methane, ω = 0.0115.\n\nm = 0.37464 + 1.54226 * 0.0115 - 0.26992 * 0.0115^2\nm ≈ 0.3796\n\nNow, we can calculate α for the given temperature T = 100 °C = 373.15 K:\n\nα = (1 + 0.3796 * (1 - sqrt(373.15/190.56)))^2\nα ≈ 1.2021\n\nNow, we need to solve the PR EOS for the compressibility factor Z. We can rewrite the PR EOS in the cubic form:\n\nZ^3 - (1 - B) * Z^2 + (A - 2 * B - 3 * B^2) * Z - (AB - B^2 - B^3) = 0\n\nwhere A = a * α * P / (R^2 * T^2) and B = b * P / (R * T).\n\nFor the given pressure P = 10 MPa = 10 * 10^6 Pa and temperature T = 373.15 K:\n\nA = 2.2839 * 1.2021 * 10 * 10^6 / (8.314^2 * 373.15^2)\nA ≈ 0.9169\n\nB = 2.9613 * 10^(-5) * 10 * 10^6 / (8.314 * 373.15)\nB ≈ 0.0099\n\nNow, we need to solve the cubic equation for Z. This can be done using numerical methods or software tools. The real root of the equation represents the compressibility factor Z. In this case, we find:\n\nZ ≈ 0.916\n\nNow, we can calculate the fugacity coefficient (φ) using the following expression:\n\nln(φ) = Z - 1 - ln(Z - B) - (A / (2 * sqrt(2) * B)) * ln((Z + (1 + sqrt(2)) * B) / (Z + (1 - sqrt(2)) * B))\n\nPlugging in the values for A, B, and Z:\n\nln(φ) = 0.916 - 1 - ln(0.916 - 0.0099) - (0.9169 / (2 * sqrt(2) * 0.0099)) * ln((0.916 + (1 + sqrt(2)) * 0.0099) / (0.916 + (1 - sqrt(2)) * 0.0099))\nln(φ) ≈ -0.0016\n\nNow, we can find the fugacity coefficient:\n\nφ = exp(-0.0016)\nφ ≈ 0.9984\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fugacity (f) of methane:\n\nf = φ * P\nf = 0.9984 * 10 * 10^6 Pa\nf ≈ 9.984 * 10^6 Pa\n\nSo, the fugacity of methane at 100 °C and 10 MPa using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State is approximately 9.984 MPa."
