    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the proton moving at 0.98c, we can use the relativistic energy equation:\n\nE = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass of the proton (938.27 MeV/c²), v is the velocity of the proton (0.98c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (gamma):\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.98c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.98²) ≈ 5.026\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of the moving proton:\n\nE = mc² * gamma = 938.27 MeV * 5.026 ≈ 4711.7 MeV\n\nSince the collision is elastic, the total energy of the system (the moving proton and the stationary proton) is conserved. The stationary proton has a rest energy of 938.27 MeV. Therefore, the total energy of the system after the collision is:\n\nTotal energy = Energy of moving proton + Energy of stationary proton = 4711.7 MeV + 938.27 MeV ≈ 5649.97 MeV"
