    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the vapor pressure of a sample of water at 50°C using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The student has the enthalpy of vaporization of water at its boiling point (40.67 kJ/mol) and its boiling point at standard pressure (100°C). The atmospheric pressure at the location is 101.325 kPa. Calculate the vapor pressure of the sample at 50°C.",
    "message_2": "To determine the vapor pressure of the water sample at 50°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nGiven:\nΔHvap = 40.67 kJ/mol = 40,670 J/mol\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K (boiling point at standard pressure)\nP1 = 101.325 kPa (standard pressure)\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 50°C. Rearranging the equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40,670 / 8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 101.325 * exp(-40,670 / 8.314 * (-0.000685))\nP2 ≈ 101.325 * exp(3.218)\nP2 ≈ 101.325 * 24.96\nP2 ≈ 2530.6 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of the water sample at 50°C is approximately 2530.6 Pa."
