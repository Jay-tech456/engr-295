    "message_2": "The efficiency of a gamma-ray detector can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (Number of detected gamma-ray interactions / Total number of gamma-rays that hit the detector) * 100\n\nIn this case, the detector detects 100 gamma-ray interactions out of 500 gamma-rays that hit the detector. So, the efficiency would be:\n\nEfficiency = (100 / 500) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%\n\nThe efficiency of the gamma-ray detector is 20%."
