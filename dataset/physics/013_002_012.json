    "message_2": "A star that is 10 times more massive than the Sun will ultimately end its life in a spectacular explosion known as a supernova. Before this event, the star goes through several stages of nuclear fusion, starting with hydrogen fusion in its core, followed by helium fusion, and then fusion of heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, neon, and silicon. This process continues until the core is primarily composed of iron.\n\nIron is the most stable element, and its fusion does not release energy. Instead, it requires energy to fuse iron into heavier elements. As a result, the core of the star becomes unstable, and the pressure from the fusion reactions in the outer layers can no longer support the core against gravitational collapse. This leads to a rapid implosion of the core, followed by a rebounding shock wave that triggers the supernova explosion.\n\nDuring the supernova, the immense energy and high temperatures generated by the explosion allow for the creation of elements heavier than iron. This process, known as nucleosynthesis, occurs through rapid neutron capture, where atomic nuclei capture free neutrons and undergo a series of beta decays to form heavier elements. This is also known as the r-process (rapid process). Elements such as gold, platinum, and uranium are formed through this process.\n\nIn summary, the final fate of a star 10 times more massive than the Sun is a supernova explosion. The creation of elements heavier than iron occurs during the last moments of the star's life through the r-process, which involves rapid neutron capture and subsequent beta decays. The resulting elements are then dispersed into the surrounding interstellar medium, contributing to the chemical enrichment of the universe."
