    "message_2": "The shape and structure of the inner ear play a crucial role in the perception of sound waves as different pitches. The inner ear consists of two main structures: the cochlea and the vestibular system. The cochlea is responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain, while the vestibular system is involved in maintaining balance and spatial orientation.\n\nThe cochlea is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure that contains the organ of Corti, which is the sensory receptor for hearing. The organ of Corti consists of hair cells that are arranged along the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane is a flexible structure that runs the length of the cochlea and varies in width and stiffness. It is wider and more flexible at the apex (the innermost part of the spiral) and narrower and stiffer at the base (the outermost part of the spiral).\n\nWhen sound waves enter the inner ear, they cause vibrations in the fluid within the cochlea. These vibrations create a traveling wave along the basilar membrane. The frequency of the sound wave determines the location on the basilar membrane where the wave reaches its maximum amplitude. High-frequency sounds cause the maximum displacement near the base of the cochlea, while low-frequency sounds cause the maximum displacement near the apex.\n\nAs the basilar membrane vibrates, the hair cells in the organ of Corti are stimulated. The movement of the hair cells generates electrical signals that are transmitted to the auditory nerve and then to the brain, where they are interpreted as different pitches. The specific location of the stimulated hair cells along the basilar membrane allows the brain to determine the frequency of the sound wave, and thus its pitch.\n\nIn summary, the shape and structure of the inner ear, particularly the cochlea and the basilar membrane, contribute to the perception of sound waves as different pitches by spatially separating the frequencies along the length of the cochlea. This allows the brain to accurately interpret the frequency of the sound wave and perceive it as a specific pitch."
