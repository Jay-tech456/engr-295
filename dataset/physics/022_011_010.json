    "message_2": "The predicted difference in gravitational lensing effects between a galaxy cluster containing a significant amount of dark matter and a galaxy cluster containing only visible matter lies in the strength and distribution of the lensing effect.\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when the mass of an object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as a background galaxy. The amount of lensing depends on the mass and distribution of the matter in the galaxy cluster. Dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light, contributes to the overall mass of a galaxy cluster and therefore affects the lensing effect.\n\nIn a galaxy cluster with a significant amount of dark matter, the gravitational lensing effect would be stronger compared to a galaxy cluster with only visible matter, due to the additional mass contributed by the dark matter. The distribution of the lensing effect would also be different, as dark matter is thought to form a halo around the visible matter in the cluster, causing the lensing effect to extend beyond the visible boundaries of the cluster.\n\nTo determine the amount of dark matter present in a galaxy cluster, astronomers can compare the observed gravitational lensing effect with the predicted lensing effect based on the visible matter in the cluster. If the observed lensing effect is stronger than the predicted effect, this indicates the presence of additional mass, which can be attributed to dark matter. By comparing the observed and predicted lensing effects, astronomers can estimate the amount of dark matter in the galaxy cluster.\n\nFurthermore, by studying the distribution of the lensing effect, astronomers can gain insights into the distribution of dark matter within the cluster. This information can help refine our understanding of the properties and behavior of dark matter, which is an important area of research in modern astrophysics."
