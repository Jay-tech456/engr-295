    "message_1": "A generator contains a wire that carries a current of 10 A. The wire is wound into a circular coil of radius 0.5 m. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (10 A), N is the number of turns in the coil, and R is the radius of the coil (0.5 m).\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the number of turns (N) in the coil. If you can provide the number of turns, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil."
