    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance from a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, for a straight wire, Ampere's law provides a simpler approach. According to Ampere's law, the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm (0.04 m) from the wire:\n\nB_4cm = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\nB_4cm = (2 × 10^(-6) T * 5) / 0.04\nB_4cm = 10^(-5) T / 0.04\nB_4cm ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-4) T\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field at a distance of 6 cm (0.06 m) from the wire:\n\nB_6cm = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.06 m)\nB_6cm = (2 × 10^(-6) T * 5) / 0.06\nB_6cm = 10^(-5) T / 0.06\nB_6cm ≈ 1.67 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-4) T, and the magnetic field at a distance of 6 cm from the wire is approximately 1.67 × 10^(-4) T."
