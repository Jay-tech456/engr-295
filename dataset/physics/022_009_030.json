    "message_2": "To estimate the annihilation rate or decay lifetime of a hypothetical dark matter particle, we can use the following relation:\n\nΓ = nσv,\n\nwhere Γ is the annihilation rate, n is the number density of dark matter particles, σ is the cross-section (10^-26 cm^3/s in this case), and v is the relative velocity of the dark matter particles.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number density (n) of dark matter particles. We can do this using the mass density of dark matter (ρ) and the mass (m) of the hypothetical dark matter particle:\n\nn = ρ / m.\n\nThe mass density of dark matter in the universe is approximately 0.3 GeV/cm^3. The mass of the hypothetical dark matter particle is given as 100 GeV. Therefore, the number density (n) is:\n\nn = 0.3 GeV/cm^3 / 100 GeV = 0.003 cm^-3.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the relative velocity (v) of the dark matter particles. In the context of dark matter, the typical relative velocity is of the order of 10^-3 times the speed of light (c). So, v ≈ 10^-3c.\n\nNow we can calculate the annihilation rate (Γ):\n\nΓ = nσv = (0.003 cm^-3)(10^-26 cm^3/s)(10^-3c) ≈ 3 × 10^-29c s^-1.\n\nTo find the decay lifetime (τ), we can use the relation:\n\nτ = 1 / Γ.\n\nτ ≈ 1 / (3 × 10^-29c s^-1) ≈ 3.33 × 10^28 s / c.\n\nSince the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 × 10^10 cm/s, the decay lifetime (τ) is:\n\nτ ≈ 3.33 × 10^28 s / (3 × 10^10 cm/s) ≈ 1.11 × 10^18 s.\n\nSo, the predicted decay lifetime of the hypothetical dark matter particle is approximately 1.11 × 10^18 seconds."
