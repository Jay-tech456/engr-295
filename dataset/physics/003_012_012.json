    "message_1": "A rectangular loop with sides of length 0.1 m and 0.05 m is placed in a magnetic field of strength 0.5 T. A current of 2 A flows through the loop. What is the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point P.\n\nHowever, calculating the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop using the Biot-Savart law can be quite complex. Instead, we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop. Ampere's law states that:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a rectangular loop, the magnetic field lines are symmetric, and the magnetic field at the center of the loop is the same for all four sides. Therefore, we can consider only one side of the loop and multiply the result by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one of the longer sides of the loop (0.1 m). The distance from the center of the loop to the middle of this side is half the shorter side (0.05/2 = 0.025 m). We can now use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field due to this side:\n\nB * dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\nB * 0.1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2 A\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the center of the loop to the middle of the longer side:\n\nr = sqrt((0.1/2)^2 + (0.025)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 0.000625) = sqrt(0.003125) = 0.0559 m\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop due to this side is:\n\nB_center = B * (0.025 / 0.0559) = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) * (0.025 / 0.0559)\n\nNow, we need to multiply this result by 4 to account for all four sides of the loop:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_center = 4 * (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) * (0.025 / 0.0559)\n\nB_total ≈ 5.65 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is approximately 5.65 × 10^(-6) T."
