    "message_1": "A 7 cm tall object is placed 20 cm in front of a convex lens with a focal length of 15 cm. If the lens suffers from chromatic aberration, what is the distance between the two images produced by the red and violet light respectively?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the two images produced by the red and violet light, we first need to calculate the image distance for each color. We can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor the red light, let's assume the focal length is slightly longer, say f_red = 15.1 cm. For the violet light, let's assume the focal length is slightly shorter, say f_violet = 14.9 cm. The object distance, u, is 20 cm for both colors.\n\nNow, we can calculate the image distance for each color:\n\nFor red light:\n1/15.1 = 1/20 + 1/v_red\n1/v_red = 1/15.1 - 1/20\nv_red = 1 / (1/15.1 - 1/20) ≈ 60.4 cm\n\nFor violet light:\n1/14.9 = 1/20 + 1/v_violet\n1/v_violet = 1/14.9 - 1/20\nv_violet = 1 / (1/14.9 - 1/20) ≈ 56.6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the two images:\n\nDistance = v_red - v_violet = 60.4 - 56.6 = 3.8 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the two images produced by the red and violet light is approximately 3.8 cm."
