    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum velocity required for a stable orbit, we can use the following equation derived from Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal force:\n\nv = √(G * M_star / r)\n\nwhere:\nv = orbital velocity\nG = gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM_star = mass of the star (2 x 10^30 kg)\nr = distance between the planet and the star (1 AU)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from astronomical units (AU) to meters:\n\n1 AU = 1.496 x 10^11 meters\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nv = √((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (2 x 10^30 kg) / (1.496 x 10^11 m))\n\nv ≈ √(8.89 x 10^20 m^2 s^-2)\n\nv ≈ 2.98 x 10^5 m/s\n\nSo, the minimum velocity required for the planet to sustain a stable orbit around the star is approximately 2.98 x 10^5 m/s."
