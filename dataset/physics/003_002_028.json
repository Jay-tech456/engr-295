    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the solenoid has 200 turns and is 10 cm (0.1 m) in length, we can calculate n as follows:\n\nn = Number of turns / Length\nn = 200 turns / 0.1 m\nn = 2000 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2000 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ Tm/A) * (4000 turns/m)\nB ≈ 5.0264 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid is approximately 5.0264 × 10⁻³ T or 5.0264 mT."
