    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the triangular loop is made of three identical straight wires, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one wire and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the height (h) of the equilateral triangle using Pythagorean theorem:\n\na = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm (half of the base)\nh² = 20² - 10²\nh² = 300\nh = √300 cm\n\nNow, let's find the angle (θ) between the position vector (r) and the current element (dl):\n\ntan(θ) = (h/2) / a\nθ = arctan((h/2) / a)\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field dB due to a small current element (dl) at the center of the triangle:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / (h/2)²\n\nIntegrating dB over the length of one wire (20 cm), we get the magnetic field B due to one wire:\n\nB₁ = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / (h/2)²\nB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) / (h/2)² * ∫dl\nB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) / (h/2)² * L\n\nwhere L is the length of one wire (20 cm).\n\nNow, let's find the total magnetic field B at the center of the triangle by multiplying B₁ by 3:\n\nB = 3 * B₁\nB = 3 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) / (h/2)² * L\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = 3 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2 A * sin(arctan((√300/2) / 10))) / (√300/2)² * 0.2 m\nB ≈ 3 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2 A * 0.9428) / 0.075 * 0.2 m\nB ≈ 3 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 1.8856 A / 0.015 m²\nB ≈ 3 * (1.8856 A * 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / 0.015 m²\nB ≈ 3 * 1.8856 × 10⁻⁷ T / 0.015 m²\nB ≈ 5.6568 × 10⁻⁷ T / 0.015 m²\nB ≈ 3.7712 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop is approximately 3.77 × 10⁻⁵ T."
