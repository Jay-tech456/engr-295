    "message_2": "There is substantial evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter, primarily through gravitational effects. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, it is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe, while normal matter (also known as baryonic matter) accounts for only about 5%.\n\nThe evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter can be observed through the following phenomena:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that they do not decrease with distance from the galactic center as expected if only normal matter were present. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat, indicating the presence of an unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the cluster. These maps reveal that the majority of the mass is not associated with the visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is consistent with a universe composed of both dark matter and normal matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter and normal matter affects the distribution of matter in the universe in several ways:\n\n1. Galaxy formation: Dark matter provides the gravitational pull necessary to initiate the collapse of gas clouds, leading to the formation of galaxies. Without dark matter, it would be difficult for galaxies to form and maintain their observed structures.\n\n2. Galaxy clusters: Dark matter plays a crucial role in holding galaxy clusters together. The gravitational force exerted by dark matter prevents the high-speed galaxies within the cluster from escaping.\n\n3. Cosmic web: The large-scale structure of the universe, known as the cosmic web, consists of interconnected filaments of dark matter and normal matter. Dark matter forms the backbone of this structure, with normal matter following the gravitational potential created by the dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for interaction between dark matter and normal matter comes from various astronomical observations, and this interaction plays a crucial role in shaping the distribution of matter in the universe."
