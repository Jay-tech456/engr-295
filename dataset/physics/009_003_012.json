    "message_1": "A physics student wants to design a glass prism that can produce total internal reflection for a certain angle of incidence. The refractive index of the prism is given to be 1.7. What should be the minimum angle of incidence to achieve total internal reflection in the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we first need to determine the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. We can use Snell's Law to find the critical angle:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the prism (1.7), n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. Since we want to find the critical angle, we set θ2 to 90 degrees:\n\n1.7 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.7\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.7)\n\nθ1 ≈ 36.26 degrees\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence to achieve total internal reflection in the prism is approximately 36.26 degrees."
