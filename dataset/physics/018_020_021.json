    "message_2": "The current experimental and theoretical evidence for the existence of dark matter particles in high-energy physics beyond the standard model mainly comes from astrophysical and cosmological observations. These observations include:\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: The observed rotation curves of galaxies do not match the predictions based on the visible matter distribution. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, as predicted by general relativity, is observed to be stronger than expected based on the visible matter alone. This can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which contributes to the overall mass of the lensing object.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature fluctuations provide information about the early universe's composition. The observed patterns in the CMB are consistent with a universe containing a significant amount of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational glue that helps form these structures.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters. Observations of this system show that the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing) is separated from the visible matter (gas and stars). This provides strong evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nSeveral proposed mechanisms for the production and detection of dark matter particles in particle colliders include:\n\n1. Supersymmetry (SUSY): SUSY is a theoretical extension of the standard model that predicts the existence of partner particles for each known particle. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a leading candidate for dark matter, as it is stable and weakly interacting. Particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), search for evidence of SUSY particles through their decay products.\n\n2. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are another class of dark matter candidates that interact weakly with ordinary matter. They can be produced in high-energy collisions at particle colliders and detected through their interactions with detector material.\n\n3. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that arise in some extensions of the standard model. They are light, weakly interacting, and could be produced in particle colliders. Specialized detectors, such as the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), are designed to search for axions.\n\n4. Dark photons: Dark photons are hypothetical particles that couple to dark matter and could mediate interactions between dark matter and ordinary matter. They could be produced in particle colliders and detected through their decay products or through their mixing with ordinary photons.\n\n5. Dark Higgs: The dark Higgs is a hypothetical particle that could be responsible for giving mass to dark matter particles. It could be produced in particle colliders and detected through its decay products or its mixing with the standard model Higgs boson.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many proposed mechanisms for the production and detection of dark matter particles in particle colliders. The search for dark matter is an ongoing and active area of research in high-energy physics."
