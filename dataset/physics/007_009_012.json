    "message_2": "The minimum enrichment level required for uranium-235 in nuclear fuel to sustain a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor depends on the specific reactor design and operational parameters. However, for most commercial light water reactors (LWRs), which are the most common type of nuclear reactors, the typical enrichment level of uranium-235 is around 3-5%.\n\nThis level of enrichment is sufficient to maintain a self-sustaining chain reaction in the reactor core while also ensuring that the reactor remains in a safe and controllable state. It is important to note that the exact enrichment level required may vary depending on factors such as the reactor's size, geometry, fuel assembly design, and the presence of neutron-absorbing materials.\n\nFor research reactors and other specialized reactor designs, the required enrichment level may be different. Some research reactors may use highly enriched uranium (HEU) with an enrichment level of 20% or higher, while others may use low-enriched uranium (LEU) with an enrichment level below 20%.\n\nIn summary, the minimum enrichment level required for uranium-235 in nuclear fuel to sustain a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor depends on the specific reactor design and operational parameters, with typical levels for commercial LWRs being around 3-5%."
