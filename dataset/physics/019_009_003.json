    "message_2": "In a φ^4 quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density is given by:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂μφ)(∂^μφ) - 1/2 m^2 φ^2 - λ/4! φ^4\n\nwhere φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the coupling constant.\n\nThe beta function β(λ) describes the running of the coupling constant λ with the energy scale μ. In perturbation theory, we can compute the beta function by calculating the renormalization group equation (RGE) up to a certain order in the loop expansion. In this case, we will compute the beta function up to two loops.\n\nAt one-loop level, the only diagram contributing to the β function is the \"tadpole\" diagram. The one-loop contribution to the β function is given by:\n\nβ_1(λ) = (3/2) λ^2 / (4π)^2\n\nAt the two-loop level, there are two types of diagrams contributing to the β function: the \"setting sun\" and the \"double tadpole\" diagrams. The two-loop contribution to the β function is given by:\n\nβ_2(λ) = (3/2) λ^3 / (4π)^4\n\nThe total beta function up to two loops is the sum of the one-loop and two-loop contributions:\n\nβ(λ) = β_1(λ) + β_2(λ) = (3/2) λ^2 / (4π)^2 + (3/2) λ^3 / (4π)^4\n\nThis is the beta function for the coupling constant λ in a φ^4 quantum field theory, treating the perturbation series up to two loops."
