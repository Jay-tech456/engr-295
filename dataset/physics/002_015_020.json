    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H) to the work input (W) required to operate the heat pump. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\n\nTo find the COP, we first need to determine the heat transferred to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H). We can use the following equation for heat pumps:\n\nQ_H = Q_L + W\n\nwhere Q_L is the heat absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir.\n\nWe can also use the Carnot efficiency for heat pumps to relate the heat absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir (Q_L) to the heat expelled to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H):\n\nCarnot efficiency = (T_H - T_L) / T_H = Q_L / Q_H\n\nwhere T_H and T_L are the absolute temperatures (in Kelvin) of the high-temperature and low-temperature reservoirs, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\n\nT_L = 5°C + 273.15 = 278.15 K\nT_H = 35°C + 273.15 = 308.15 K\n\nNow, we can find the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCarnot efficiency = (308.15 - 278.15) / 308.15 = 0.0975\n\nNow, we can express Q_L in terms of Q_H using the Carnot efficiency:\n\nQ_L = 0.0975 * Q_H\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for Q_L into the equation for heat pumps:\n\nQ_H = (0.0975 * Q_H) + 3000\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_H:\n\nQ_H - 0.0975 * Q_H = 3000\nQ_H * (1 - 0.0975) = 3000\nQ_H * 0.9025 = 3000\nQ_H = 3000 / 0.9025 ≈ 3325.07 J\n\nNow that we have the value of Q_H, we can find the COP of the heat pump:\n\nCOP = Q_H / W = 3325.07 J / 3000 J ≈ 1.108\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is approximately 1.108."
