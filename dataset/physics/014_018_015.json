    "message_2": "The maximum exposure to cosmic rays that a space traveler can sustain before experiencing serious health risks depends on several factors, including the duration of the mission, the shielding provided by the spacecraft, and the individual's age and health.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and can penetrate spacecraft and human bodies. They can cause damage to cells and DNA, increasing the risk of cancer and other health issues.\n\nNASA and other space agencies use a unit called millisievert (mSv) to measure the biological effect of ionizing radiation. The recommended dose limits for astronauts are based on the guidelines provided by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).\n\nFor low-Earth orbit missions, such as those on the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts are limited to a career dose of 1,000 millisieverts (1 sievert) for men and 800 millisieverts (0.8 sieverts) for women. This difference is due to the higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women.\n\nFor deep space missions, such as a mission to Mars, the radiation exposure is expected to be significantly higher due to the lack of Earth's protective magnetic field. A round trip to Mars could expose astronauts to an estimated 500-1000 millisieverts of radiation, which is close to or even exceeding the recommended career dose limits.\n\nTo minimize the health risks associated with cosmic rays, spacecraft shielding and mission durations must be carefully considered. Additionally, ongoing research is being conducted to develop advanced shielding materials and countermeasures to protect astronauts from the harmful effects of cosmic radiation."
