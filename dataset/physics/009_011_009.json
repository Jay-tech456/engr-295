    "message_1": "A student is given a spherical lens with a focal length of 10 cm and an index of refraction of 1.5. The student wants to mount this lens in air with an object placed 25 cm away from the lens to obtain a final image position of 20 cm. What is the required radius of curvature for each side of the lens? Use the Lensmaker's Equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lensmaker's Equation:\n\n(1/f) = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two sides of the lens.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 10 cm) and the index of refraction (n = 1.5). We need to find R1 and R2.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the Lensmaker's Equation:\n\n(1/10) = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2).\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(1/10) = 0.5 * (1/R1 - 1/R2).\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n1 = 5 * (1/R1 - 1/R2).\n\nSince we have two unknowns (R1 and R2) and only one equation, we need to make an assumption to solve the problem. Let's assume that the lens is symmetric, meaning that R1 = R2. This is a reasonable assumption for many lenses. With this assumption, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = 5 * (1/R1 - 1/R1).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1 = 0.\n\nHowever, this equation is not possible. This means that our assumption of the lens being symmetric is incorrect. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of R1 and R2 with the given information."
