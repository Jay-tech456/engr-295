    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the time experienced by the moving observer (the astronauts), t is the time experienced by the stationary observer (people on Earth), v is the velocity of the moving observer (0.8 times the speed of light), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time for the one-way trip according to the people on Earth. Since the round trip takes 8 years, the one-way trip takes 4 years.\n\nt = 4 years\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the time dilation equation:\n\nt' = 4 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nt' = 4 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nt' = 4 / sqrt(0.36)\nt' = 4 / 0.6\nt' ≈ 6.67 years\n\nSince this is the time for the one-way trip according to the astronauts, the round trip will take twice this amount of time:\n\nTotal time for astronauts = 2 * 6.67 years ≈ 13.34 years\n\nSo, when the astronauts return to Earth, approximately 13.34 years will have passed for them."
