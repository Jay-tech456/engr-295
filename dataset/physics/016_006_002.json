    "message_2": "Lattice vibrations, also known as phonons, play a crucial role in the mechanism of conventional superconductivity. The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor is the temperature below which the material exhibits zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields. In conventional superconductors, the superconducting state is achieved through the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that are bound together by an attractive interaction mediated by lattice vibrations or phonons.\n\nThe electron-phonon interaction is responsible for the attractive force between electrons, which overcomes the natural repulsion between them due to their negative charges. When the temperature is lowered, the lattice vibrations become more pronounced, and the electron-phonon interaction becomes stronger, leading to the formation of more Cooper pairs and the onset of superconductivity.\n\nThe critical temperature of a superconductor depends on several factors, including the strength of the electron-phonon interaction, the density of states at the Fermi level, and the isotopic mass of the constituent atoms. By optimizing these factors, it is possible to increase the critical temperature of a superconductor.\n\nHowever, there is a limit to how much the critical temperature can be increased through optimizing lattice vibrations. The highest critical temperature achieved in conventional superconductors, which are primarily governed by the electron-phonon interaction, is around 39 K in magnesium diboride (MgB2). This is still far below the temperature required for practical applications, which is why researchers are exploring other mechanisms of superconductivity, such as those found in high-temperature superconductors (HTS).\n\nHigh-temperature superconductors, such as cuprates and iron-based superconductors, exhibit critical temperatures much higher than conventional superconductors, with some reaching up to 138 K. The mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity is still not fully understood, but it is believed that lattice vibrations play a less dominant role in these materials, and other interactions, such as spin fluctuations or orbital fluctuations, may be responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs.\n\nIn conclusion, lattice vibrations play a significant role in determining the critical temperature of conventional superconductors. However, the maximum critical temperature achievable through optimizing lattice vibrations is limited, and other mechanisms need to be explored to achieve higher critical temperatures for practical applications."
