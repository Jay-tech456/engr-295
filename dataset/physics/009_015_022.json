    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens at different distances from the optical axis do not converge at the same point. This is due to the fact that the lens surfaces are spherical, and the focal length varies slightly with the distance from the optical axis.\n\nTo determine the spherical aberration, we need to find the difference in the focal lengths for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge (5 cm from the optical axis) and at the center (on the optical axis).\n\nLet's denote the focal length for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge as f_edge and the focal length for the light rays passing through the lens at the center as f_center.\n\nWe know that the lens-maker's formula is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nFor a biconvex lens, R1 and R2 have the same magnitude but opposite signs, so the formula becomes:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (2/R),\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the lens surfaces.\n\nNow, let's consider the paraxial approximation, which states that the focal length is approximately the same for all light rays passing through the lens close to the optical axis. In this case, f_center ≈ 15 cm.\n\nTo find the focal length for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge (f_edge), we need to consider the lens as a thin lens with a smaller diameter (5 cm from the optical axis). This means that the radius of curvature of the lens surfaces will be slightly different for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge.\n\nLet's denote the radius of curvature of the lens surfaces for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge as R_edge. Using the lens-maker's formula, we can write:\n\n1/f_edge = (n - 1) * (2/R_edge).\n\nSince we don't know the refractive index (n) and the radius of curvature (R_edge) for the light rays passing through the lens at the edge, we cannot directly calculate f_edge. However, we can estimate the spherical aberration by assuming that the difference in the focal lengths is proportional to the difference in the lens diameters.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of the focal length difference to the lens diameter difference as k:\n\nk = (f_edge - f_center) / (10 cm - 5 cm).\n\nNow, we can estimate the spherical aberration (Δf) as:\n\nΔf = k * (10 cm - 5 cm).\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of k, we cannot provide a numerical value for the spherical aberration. However, this approach gives us an idea of how the spherical aberration depends on the lens diameter and the difference in the focal lengths for the light rays passing through the lens at different distances from the optical axis."
