    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through the weak force, unlike the known active neutrinos (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos). If sterile neutrinos make up the entirety of dark matter, their mass range would need to be in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) scale. This is because lighter sterile neutrinos would not provide enough mass to account for the observed dark matter, while heavier sterile neutrinos would over-close the universe.\n\nThe mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is typically between 1 keV and 50 keV. However, it is important to note that the exact mass range depends on the specific model and assumptions made about the sterile neutrino properties and their production mechanisms in the early universe.\n\nIn comparison, the mass of a typical neutrino (electron, muon, or tau neutrino) is much smaller. The exact masses of these active neutrinos are not yet known, but experimental data from neutrino oscillations indicate that their mass differences are on the order of 10^(-2) eV (electronvolt) and 10^(-1) eV. The sum of the masses of the three active neutrinos is constrained to be less than 0.12 eV, according to the Planck 2018 results.\n\nIn summary, if sterile neutrinos make up the entirety of dark matter, their expected mass range would be in the keV scale, which is significantly larger than the mass of a typical active neutrino, which is in the sub-eV scale."
