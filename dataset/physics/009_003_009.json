    "message_2": "To determine the critical angle of incidence for a light ray passing from an acrylic block into the air, we can use Snell's Law, which relates the angle of incidence to the angle of refraction. Snell's Law is given by:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (acrylic and air, respectively), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, the refractive index of the acrylic (n1) is 1.50, and the refractive index of air (n2) is approximately 1.00. The critical angle of incidence occurs when the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees, as the light ray will be refracted along the surface of the acrylic block.\n\nSo, we can rewrite Snell's Law for the critical angle as:\n\n1.50 * sin(θ1) = 1.00 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n1.50 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle of incidence (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.50\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.50)\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for a light ray passing from an acrylic block into the air is approximately 41.81 degrees."
