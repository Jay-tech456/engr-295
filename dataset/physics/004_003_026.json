    "message_2": "In the theory of general relativity, the motion of a free-falling particle in a curved spacetime is described by the geodesic equation. The geodesic equation is given by:\n\nd²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ (dx^α/dτ) (dx^β/dτ) = 0\n\nHere, x^μ represents the spacetime coordinates (t, x, y, z), τ is the proper time, and Γ^μ_αβ are the Christoffel symbols, which are functions of the metric tensor g_αβ and its derivatives. The metric tensor encodes the geometry of the curved spacetime.\n\nIn flat spacetime, as described by special relativity, the spacetime is Minkowski, and the metric tensor is given by the Minkowski metric η_αβ. In this case, the Christoffel symbols Γ^μ_αβ are all zero. Therefore, the geodesic equation in flat spacetime simplifies to:\n\nd²x^μ/dτ² = 0\n\nThis equation implies that the four-velocity (dx^μ/dτ) is constant along the path of the particle, which is consistent with the principle of inertia in special relativity.\n\nIn summary, the geodesic equation of motion in curved spacetime involves the Christoffel symbols, which account for the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of mass-energy. In contrast, in flat spacetime, the Christoffel symbols are zero, and the geodesic equation simplifies to the principle of inertia."
