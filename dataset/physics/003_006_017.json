    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the magnetic field at a point P located at the center of a circular coil with N turns and radius R carrying a current I. The student also needs to determine the direction of the magnetic field at point P assuming the current is flowing clockwise.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I). For a circular coil, the formula for the magnetic field at the center is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field at point P,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nN is the number of turns in the coil,\nI is the current flowing through the coil, and\nR is the radius of the coil.\n\nTo determine the direction of the magnetic field at point P, we can use the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing clockwise, point your right thumb in the direction of the current (clockwise) and curl your fingers. Your fingers will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field at point P will be pointing downward (or into the plane of the coil)."
