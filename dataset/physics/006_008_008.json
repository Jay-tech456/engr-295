    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum frequency of incident light required to liberate electrons from the surface of a sodium metal plate, we can use the equation for the photoelectric effect:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy required to liberate the electrons (equal to the work function), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the incident light.\n\nThe work function is given as 2.3 eV. We need to convert this to joules:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, 2.3 eV = 2.3 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J = 3.6846 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can solve for the frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (3.6846 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 5.56 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThe minimum frequency of incident light required to liberate electrons from the surface of a sodium metal plate is 5.56 x 10^14 Hz.\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons if 2.5 eV of energy is supplied to each photoelectron. The kinetic energy can be found using the equation:\n\nKE = E_photon - E_workfunction\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, E_photon is the energy of the incident photon, and E_workfunction is the work function of the sodium metal plate.\n\nWe are given that 2.5 eV of energy is supplied to each photoelectron, so:\n\nE_photon = 2.5 eV = 2.5 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J = 4.005 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy:\n\nKE = E_photon - E_workfunction = (4.005 x 10^-19 J) - (3.6846 x 10^-19 J) = 3.204 x 10^-20 J\n\nTo convert the kinetic energy back to electron volts:\n\nKE = 3.204 x 10^-20 J * (1 eV / 1.602 x 10^-19 J) = 0.2 eV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is 0.2 eV."
