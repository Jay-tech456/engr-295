    "message_2": "To find the half-life of a radioactive isotope, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the isotope remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount of the isotope, T is the half-life, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN(t) = 25 grams (remaining amount after 30 minutes)\nN0 = 100 grams (initial amount)\nt = 30 minutes\n\nWe want to find T (the half-life). Rearranging the formula to solve for T, we get:\n\nT = (t * log(1/2)) / log(N(t)/N0)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT = (30 * log(1/2)) / log(25/100)\n\nT â‰ˆ 15 minutes\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive isotope is approximately 15 minutes."
