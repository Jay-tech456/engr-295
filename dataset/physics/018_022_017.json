    "message_2": "The decay of a neutron into an electron, antineutrino, and proton is known as beta decay. The probability of a neutron undergoing beta decay within a certain period of time can be calculated using its half-life, which is the time it takes for half of a sample of neutrons to decay. The half-life of a free neutron is approximately 10.2 minutes.\n\nTo calculate the probability of decay within 15 minutes, we can use the formula:\n\nP = 1 - e^(-t/T)\n\nwhere P is the probability of decay, t is the time period (15 minutes), T is the half-life of the neutron (10.2 minutes), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nP = 1 - e^(-15/10.2)\nP ≈ 1 - e^(-1.47)\nP ≈ 1 - 0.229\nP ≈ 0.771\n\nSo, the probability of a neutron decaying within 15 minutes is approximately 77.1%.\n\nRegarding the energy state of the neutron, it is important to note that the half-life of a free neutron is not significantly affected by its energy state. The half-life remains approximately the same for both high and low energy states. Therefore, the probability of decay within 15 minutes would still be approximately 77.1% for a neutron in a lower energy state."
