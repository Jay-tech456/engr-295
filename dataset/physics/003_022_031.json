    "message_1": "A student needs to calculate the magnetic field strength 2 cm away from a straight wire carrying a current of 3 A. The wire is made of copper and has a diameter of 2 mm. Assuming the wire is infinitely long, what is the magnetic field strength in Tesla at the given distance?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance from a straight wire carrying a current, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength in Tesla, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in Amperes, and r is the distance from the wire in meters.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 3 A, and the distance r is 2 cm, which is equal to 0.02 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.04 m)\n\nB ≈ 9.55 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength 2 cm away from the straight wire carrying a current of 3 A is approximately 9.55 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
