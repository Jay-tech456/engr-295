    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat required to completely melt 200 grams of ice at 0°C, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = m * Lf\n\nwhere Q is the amount of heat required, m is the mass of the ice, and Lf is the latent heat of fusion of ice.\n\nGiven:\nm = 200 grams\nLf = 334 J/g\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\nQ = 200 g * 334 J/g\n\nQ = 66800 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat required to completely melt 200 grams of ice at 0°C into water is 66,800 Joules."
