    "message_2": "The mathematical model for predicting the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a collapsing star can be derived from the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. The formula is given by:\n\nh(t) = (G/c^4) * (2 * d^2 * Q''(t)) / R\n\nwhere:\n- h(t) is the amplitude of the gravitational wave at time t\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- c is the speed of light\n- d is the distance from the source to the observer\n- Q''(t) is the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution\n- R is the distance from the center of the collapsing star to the observer\n\nThe quadrupole moment of the mass distribution can be expressed as:\n\nQ_ij(t) = ∫ ρ(x, t) * (x_i * x_j - (1/3) * δ_ij * r^2) d^3x\n\nwhere:\n- ρ(x, t) is the mass density of the collapsing star at position x and time t\n- x_i and x_j are the Cartesian coordinates\n- δ_ij is the Kronecker delta\n- r is the distance from the center of the collapsing star\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the characteristic timescale of the collapse, τ:\n\nf ~ 1 / τ\n\nThe timescale of the collapse can be related to the mass and rate of collapse of the star. For example, in the case of a core-collapse supernova, the timescale can be estimated as:\n\nτ ~ (G * M / R^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\n- M is the mass of the collapsing star\n- R is the radius of the collapsing star\n\nBy combining these equations and considering the specific properties of the collapsing star, such as its mass and rate of collapse, one can predict the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the collapsing star."
