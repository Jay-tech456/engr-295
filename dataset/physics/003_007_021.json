    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the rod on the horizontal plane, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is perpendicular to the horizontal plane, we can consider the rod as a series of small current elements along its length. Let's divide the rod into small segments of length Δy, with each segment carrying a current I. The distance from the center of the rod to the point on the horizontal plane is 10 cm, so the position vector r has a magnitude of 10 cm.\n\nWe can integrate the magnetic field contributions from each small segment along the length of the rod. Let's set up the integral:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * Δy x r) / r³\n\nSince the rod is 20 cm long, we will integrate from -10 cm to 10 cm. The angle between Δy and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\nΔy x r = Δy * r * sin(90) = Δy * r\n\nNow, let's set up the integral with respect to y:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(Δy * r) / r³ dy from -10 cm to 10 cm\n\nThe distance r is the square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal distance (10 cm) and the vertical distance y:\n\nr = √(10² + y²)\n\nNow, we can substitute r into the integral and simplify:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(Δy * √(10² + y²)) / (10² + y²) dy from -10 cm to 10 cm\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(Δy / √(10² + y²)) dy from -10 cm to 10 cm\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [ln(√(10² + y²) + y)] from -10 cm to 10 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of μ₀ and I:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A / 4π) * [ln(√(10² + 10²) + 10) - ln(√(10² + (-10)²) - 10)]\n\nB = (2 × 10⁻⁷ T) * [ln(√200 + 10) - ln(√200 - 10)]\n\nB = (2 × 10⁻⁷ T) * [ln((√200 + 10) / (√200 - 10))]\n\nB ≈ 3.36 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the rod on the horizontal plane is approximately 3.36 × 10⁻⁶ T."
