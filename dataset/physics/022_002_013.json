    "message_2": "The estimated percentage of total mass-energy in the universe represented by dark matter is approximately 27%. This leaves about 5% for ordinary matter (such as stars, planets, and gas) and 68% for dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nAstrophysicists predict and measure the abundance of dark matter through several methods:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter does not emit or absorb light, but it does have mass, which means it can bend light due to its gravitational influence. By observing the way light from distant galaxies is distorted as it passes through regions of dark matter, astrophysicists can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation speed of stars and gas in galaxies can be used to estimate the mass distribution within the galaxy. Observations show that the rotation speed remains roughly constant at large distances from the galactic center, which implies the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, astrophysicists can determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. By studying the large-scale structure of the universe, astrophysicists can infer the distribution and abundance of dark matter.\n\n5. Computer simulations: Astrophysicists use computer simulations to model the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. By comparing these simulations with observations, they can determine the role of dark matter in the formation of these structures and estimate its abundance.\n\nThese methods, along with others, provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and help astrophysicists estimate its abundance in the universe."
