    "message_2": "To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the formula:\n\nΔH = Cp × ΔT\n\nwhere Cp is the heat capacity (50 J/K) and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial\nΔT = 37°C - 25°C\nΔT = 12°C (or 12 K, since the difference in temperature remains the same when converting between Celsius and Kelvin)\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH):\n\nΔH = Cp × ΔT\nΔH = 50 J/K × 12 K\nΔH = 600 J\n\nSince the reaction is exothermic, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) will be negative:\n\nΔH = -600 J\n\nSo, the change in enthalpy for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction with a temperature increase from 25°C to 37°C is -600 J."
