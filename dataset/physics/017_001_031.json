    "message_2": "Changing the temperature affects the conductivity of graphene differently than it does for other materials studied in condensed matter physics. To understand this, let's first discuss the general behavior of conductivity in materials and then compare it to graphene.\n\nIn most materials, conductivity is influenced by temperature due to the presence of charge carriers (electrons and holes) and their mobility. For metals, increasing temperature leads to increased lattice vibrations, which in turn scatter the charge carriers, reducing their mobility and thus decreasing the conductivity. This is why metals generally have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.\n\nFor semiconductors, the situation is more complex. At low temperatures, semiconductors have few charge carriers, and their conductivity is low. As the temperature increases, more charge carriers are generated due to thermal excitation, which increases conductivity. However, at even higher temperatures, the increased lattice vibrations start to dominate, scattering the charge carriers and reducing their mobility, leading to a decrease in conductivity. This results in a non-linear relationship between temperature and conductivity for semiconductors.\n\nGraphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exhibits unique electronic properties due to its two-dimensional nature and the presence of massless Dirac fermions as charge carriers. In pristine graphene, the charge carriers have very high mobility, and the material exhibits ballistic transport, meaning that the electrons can travel long distances without scattering.\n\nWhen it comes to the temperature dependence of graphene's conductivity, it is different from both metals and semiconductors. At low temperatures, graphene's conductivity is dominated by electron-electron interactions and is relatively insensitive to temperature. As the temperature increases, the conductivity starts to decrease, but this decrease is weaker than in metals. This is because the scattering of charge carriers in graphene is primarily due to electron-phonon interactions, which are less sensitive to temperature than the lattice vibrations in metals.\n\nIn summary, changing the temperature affects the conductivity of graphene differently than other materials studied in condensed matter physics. While metals and semiconductors show a strong temperature dependence of conductivity, graphene's conductivity is less sensitive to temperature changes, primarily due to its unique electronic properties and the nature of scattering mechanisms in the material."
