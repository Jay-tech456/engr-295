    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational waves produced by two black holes, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave power. This formula is an approximation and assumes that the black holes are in a circular orbit around each other. The formula for the power (P) radiated in the form of gravitational waves is:\n\nP = (32/5) * (G^4/c^5) * (m1 * m2)^2 * (m1 + m2) / r^5\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes, and r is the separation distance between them.\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the black holes to kilograms. One solar mass (M☉) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, each black hole has a mass of 10 M☉, which is:\n\nmass = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, let's convert the separation distance from kilometers to meters:\n\ndistance = 1000 km = 1000 * 1000 m = 10^6 m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = (32/5) * (G^4/c^5) * (m1 * m2)^2 * (m1 + m2) / r^5\nP = (32/5) * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^4 / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^5 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)^2 * (2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (10^6 m)^5\n\nP ≈ 3.64 x 10^47 kg^2 m^6 s^-7 / 2.99 x 10^40 kg m^3 s^-3\nP ≈ 1.22 x 10^52 kg m^3 s^-4\n\nThe power radiated in the form of gravitational waves is approximately 1.22 x 10^52 watts. Note that this is a highly idealized calculation and assumes a circular orbit and non-spinning black holes. In reality, the system would be more complex, and a more accurate calculation would require numerical simulations."
