    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is square, we can divide it into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field. Let's consider one of the segments and divide it into small current elements dl.\n\nLet's consider a small current element dl at a distance y from the center of the segment. The position vector r from the current element to point P is given by:\n\nr = (x² + y²)^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field dB due to this small current element dl:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * (x² + y²)^(-3/2)) * sinθ\n\nwhere θ is the angle between dl and r. In this case, θ = 90°, so sinθ = 1.\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the entire segment to get the magnetic field due to one segment:\n\nB_segment = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * (x² + y²)^(-3/2)) dy, with limits from -a/2 to a/2\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(x² + y²)^(-3/2) dy, with limits from -a/2 to a/2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let's substitute:\n\nu = y² + x²\ndu = 2y dy\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ * I / 8πx) * ∫u^(-3/2) du, with limits from (x² + (a/2)²) to (x² + (-a/2)²)\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ * I / 8πx) * [-2u^(-1/2)] with limits from (x² + (a/2)²) to (x² + (-a/2)²)\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ * I / 4πx) * [(x² + (-a/2)²)^(-1/2) - (x² + (a/2)²)^(-1/2)]\n\nSince there are 4 segments in the square loop, the total magnetic field at point P is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_segment\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I / πx) * [(x² + (-a/2)²)^(-1/2) - (x² + (a/2)²)^(-1/2)]\n\nThis is the magnetic field at point P located at a distance 'x' from the center of the square loop in the plane of the loop."
