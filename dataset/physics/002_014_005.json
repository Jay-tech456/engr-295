    "message_1": "A refrigerator takes in heat from a cold environment at 5°C and expels heat to a room at 25°C. If the work done on the refrigerator is 500 J and the heat expelled to the room is 800 J, what is the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the cold environment (Q_c) to the work done on the refrigerator (W).\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat removed from the cold environment (Q_c). We know that the heat expelled to the room (Q_h) is 800 J and the work done on the refrigerator (W) is 500 J. According to the energy conservation principle, the heat removed from the cold environment (Q_c) plus the work done on the refrigerator (W) is equal to the heat expelled to the room (Q_h).\n\nQ_c + W = Q_h\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_c:\n\nQ_c = Q_h - W\nQ_c = 800 J - 500 J\nQ_c = 300 J\n\nNow that we have the heat removed from the cold environment (Q_c), we can calculate the COP:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\nCOP = 300 J / 500 J\nCOP = 0.6\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator is 0.6."
