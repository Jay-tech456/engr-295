    "message_2": "To calculate the stress-energy tensor for a non-rotating black hole, we first need to find the appropriate metric describing the spacetime around the black hole. For a non-rotating black hole in empty space, the Schwarzschild metric is the appropriate solution to the Einstein field equations. The Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r) dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and (t, r, θ, φ) are the Schwarzschild coordinates.\n\nThe stress-energy tensor T^(μν) is related to the Einstein tensor G^(μν) through the Einstein field equations:\n\nG^(μν) = (8πG/c⁴) T^(μν)\n\nThe Einstein tensor G^(μν) is a function of the metric tensor g_(μν) and its first and second derivatives. To calculate G^(μν), we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^(λ)_(μν) and the Riemann curvature tensor R^(λ)_(μνρσ), which are derived from the metric tensor and its first derivatives. Then, we can compute the Ricci tensor R_(μν) and the Ricci scalar R by contracting the Riemann tensor. Finally, we can obtain the Einstein tensor G^(μν) using the following relation:\n\nG^(μν) = R^(μν) - (1/2) g^(μν) R\n\nNow, since we are considering a black hole in empty space, the stress-energy tensor T^(μν) should be zero everywhere outside the black hole. This is because there is no matter or energy present in the spacetime, and the only source of the gravitational field is the black hole itself. Therefore, we have:\n\nT^(μν) = 0\n\nfor all points outside the event horizon of the black hole. Inside the event horizon, the stress-energy tensor is not well-defined, as the spacetime becomes singular at the black hole's center."
