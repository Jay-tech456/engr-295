    "message_2": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were first proposed in the 1970s as a solution to the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are also considered as one of the leading candidates for dark matter, which is the invisible and mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nThe mass range of axion particles is predicted to be extremely light, typically between 10^-6 eV and 10^-3 eV. This light mass allows axions to behave as cold dark matter (CDM), which means they move slowly and can clump together to form large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. This behavior is consistent with the observed distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\nSeveral astrophysical and cosmological observations, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure formation, and the rotation curves of galaxies, suggest that dark matter is primarily composed of cold, non-baryonic particles. Axions fit this description well, as they are expected to be weakly interacting and have a negligible thermal velocity.\n\nMoreover, the predicted mass range of axions allows them to form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at cosmological scales. This condensate could explain the observed distribution of dark matter in the universe, as it would lead to the formation of stable, self-gravitating structures that can seed the growth of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range of axion particles aligns well with the observed distribution of dark matter in the universe, as their light mass and cold dark matter behavior allow them to form large-scale structures consistent with current observations. However, it is important to note that the existence of axions has not been experimentally confirmed yet, and other dark matter candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), are also being considered. Ongoing experiments and observations aim to detect axions or other dark matter particles directly, which would provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and its role in the evolution of the universe."
