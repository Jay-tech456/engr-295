    "message_1": "A diffraction grating with 800 lines per millimeter is illuminated with a monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm. What is the angle between the first and second order maxima? (Use the formula d sinθ = mλ, where d is the distance between adjacent slits, θ is the angle between the incident beam and the normal to the grating surface, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the distance between adjacent slits (d). Since there are 800 lines per millimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\n1 mm = 1000 µm\nNumber of lines = 800 lines/mm\n\nd = (1000 µm / 800 lines) * (1 µm / 1000 nm) = 1.25 nm/line\n\nNow, we can use the formula d sinθ = mλ to find the angles for the first and second order maxima.\n\nFor the first order maximum (m = 1):\n\n1.25 nm * sinθ1 = 1 * 500 nm\nsinθ1 = 500 nm / 1.25 nm = 0.4\nθ1 = arcsin(0.4) ≈ 23.58°\n\nFor the second order maximum (m = 2):\n\n1.25 nm * sinθ2 = 2 * 500 nm\nsinθ2 = 1000 nm / 1.25 nm = 0.8\nθ2 = arcsin(0.8) ≈ 53.13°\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the first and second order maxima:\n\nΔθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 53.13° - 23.58° ≈ 29.55°\n\nThe angle between the first and second order maxima is approximately 29.55°."
