    "message_2": "To determine the ratio of sterile neutrinos to ordinary matter required to account for the observed amount of dark matter in the universe, we need to consider the current theories and experimental data on dark matter and sterile neutrinos.\n\nDark matter is estimated to make up about 26.8% of the total energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (baryonic matter) accounts for about 4.9%. This means that dark matter is roughly 5.4 times more abundant than ordinary matter (26.8% / 4.9% â‰ˆ 5.4).\n\nSterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity, making them a potential dark matter candidate. However, their existence has not been confirmed experimentally, and their properties, such as mass and mixing angles, are still uncertain.\n\nTo account for the observed amount of dark matter in the universe, the ratio of sterile neutrinos to ordinary matter would need to be such that the total mass of sterile neutrinos is approximately 5.4 times the mass of ordinary matter. However, without knowing the exact mass and properties of sterile neutrinos, it is difficult to provide a precise ratio.\n\nIn summary, the ratio of sterile neutrinos to ordinary matter required to account for the observed amount of dark matter in the universe would depend on the properties of sterile neutrinos, which are currently uncertain. Further experimental data and theoretical developments are needed to provide a more accurate answer."
