    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not emit or absorb light or other electromagnetic radiation, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThe presence of dark matter can affect the formation and growth of black holes in several ways:\n\n1. Dark matter halos and galaxy formation: Dark matter is believed to form halos around galaxies, providing the gravitational scaffolding for galaxy formation. These halos can help funnel gas and other baryonic matter into the central regions of galaxies, where it can accumulate and eventually form black holes. The more massive the dark matter halo, the more gas and baryonic matter it can attract, leading to the formation of more massive black holes.\n\n2. Dark matter accretion: Black holes can grow by accreting dark matter particles that pass close enough to be captured by their gravitational pull. Although dark matter particles do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, they still experience gravitational forces. As a result, they can be attracted to and captured by black holes, contributing to their growth. The rate of dark matter accretion depends on the density of dark matter in the vicinity of the black hole and the black hole's mass.\n\n3. Dark matter annihilation: Some theories propose that dark matter particles can annihilate each other when they come into close contact, releasing energy in the form of high-energy particles and radiation. If this process occurs near a black hole, the released energy can be captured by the black hole, contributing to its growth. This effect is highly dependent on the specific properties of dark matter particles and the rate at which they annihilate.\n\n4. Gravitational interactions: Dark matter can also affect the growth of black holes through gravitational interactions with other celestial objects, such as stars and gas clouds. These interactions can cause objects to be deflected towards the black hole, increasing the rate at which it accretes matter and grows in mass.\n\nSupporting evidence for these effects comes from observations of galaxies and their central black holes. Studies have shown a correlation between the mass of a galaxy's central black hole and the mass of its dark matter halo, suggesting that dark matter plays a role in the formation and growth of black holes. Additionally, simulations of galaxy formation that include dark matter have been able to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies and their black holes more accurately than simulations without dark matter.\n\nCalculations related to these effects are complex and depend on various factors, such as the density and distribution of dark matter, the properties of dark matter particles, and the specific astrophysical environment in which the black hole resides. To perform these calculations, physicists typically use sophisticated computer simulations that incorporate the relevant physical processes and allow them to study the effects of dark matter on black hole formation and growth in a controlled and systematic way."
