    "message_2": "The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. To find the critical angle, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (water and air in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence (the critical angle), and θ2 is the angle of refraction (90 degrees in this case).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the critical angle, we get:\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nSince the refractive index of water (n1) is 1.33 and that of air (n2) is 1.00, and the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees, we can plug in these values:\n\nsin(θ1) = (1.00 * sin(90°)) / 1.33\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.33\n\nNow, to find the critical angle (θ1), we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.33)\n\nθ1 ≈ 48.8 degrees\n\nSo, the critical angle for a light ray traveling from water to air is approximately 48.8 degrees."
