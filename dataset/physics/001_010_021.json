    "message_2": "The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle, like an electron, is influenced by an electromagnetic potential even if it doesn't pass through the region where the magnetic field is non-zero. In this case, we have an electron moving around a long solenoid carrying a magnetic field without intersecting the magnetic field lines.\n\nTo calculate the phase shift experienced by the electron, we first need to find the magnetic vector potential (A) outside the solenoid. For a long solenoid with a uniform magnetic field (B) inside, the magnetic vector potential outside the solenoid can be written as:\n\nA = (μ₀ * n * I * r) / (2 * π * R²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, n is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, I is the current in the solenoid, r is the distance from the center of the solenoid to the electron's path, and R is the radius of the solenoid.\n\nNow, we can calculate the phase shift (Δϕ) experienced by the electron using the Aharonov-Bohm effect formula:\n\nΔϕ = (e * ∮A⋅dl) / ħ\n\nwhere e is the charge of the electron, A is the magnetic vector potential, dl is the infinitesimal path length along the electron's trajectory, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSince the electron moves around the solenoid in a loop, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nΔϕ = (e * 2 * π * r * A) / ħ\n\nSubstituting the expression for A, we get:\n\nΔϕ = (e * 2 * π * r * (μ₀ * n * I * r) / (2 * π * R²)) / ħ\n\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain:\n\nΔϕ = (e * μ₀ * n * I * r²) / (ħ * R²)\n\nThis is the phase shift experienced by the electron due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n\nThe physical significance of this phase shift is that it demonstrates the non-local nature of quantum mechanics. Even though the electron never enters the region where the magnetic field is non-zero, it still experiences a phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential. This effect has been experimentally verified and is an important aspect of the quantum mechanical description of charged particles in electromagnetic fields."
