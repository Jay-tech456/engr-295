    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy and momentum of the spaceship, we'll need to use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic kinetic energy: KE = (γ - 1)mc^2\n2. Relativistic momentum: p = γmv\n3. Lorentz factor: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\n- KE is the relativistic kinetic energy\n- γ is the Lorentz factor\n- m is the rest mass of the spaceship\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to the observer on Earth\n- p is the relativistic momentum\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy (KE):\n\nKE = (γ - 1)mc^2\nKE = (2.294 - 1)(1000 kg)(3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nKE ≈ 1.294(1000 kg)(9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nKE ≈ 1.1646 x 10^20 Joules\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np = (2.294)(1000 kg)(0.9)(3 x 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 617,220,000 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the spaceship is approximately 1.1646 x 10^20 Joules, and its momentum is approximately 617,220,000 kg m/s."
