    "message_2": "To determine the impurity concentration in the ethanol sample using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Prepare the sample: Dissolve the ethanol sample in an appropriate deuterated solvent, such as deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or deuterated water (D2O). The deuterated solvent is necessary because it does not interfere with the NMR signals of the ethanol and impurities.\n\n2. Run the NMR experiment: Place the prepared sample in an NMR tube and insert it into the NMR spectrometer. Run a 1H-NMR experiment, which will provide a spectrum with peaks corresponding to the hydrogen atoms in the ethanol and impurity molecules.\n\n3. Analyze the NMR spectrum: Examine the NMR spectrum and identify the peaks corresponding to the ethanol molecule. Ethanol has three distinct peaks: one for the methyl group (CH3), one for the methylene group (CH2), and one for the hydroxyl group (OH). The remaining peaks in the spectrum correspond to the impurities.\n\n4. Quantify the impurity peaks: Integrate the area under the peaks corresponding to the impurities. The integration values are proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in the impurity molecules.\n\n5. Normalize the impurity peak integrations: Divide the integration values of the impurity peaks by the integration value of a known ethanol peak (e.g., the methyl group peak). This will give you the relative concentration of the impurities compared to the ethanol concentration.\n\n6. Calculate the impurity concentration: Multiply the relative concentration of the impurities by the known concentration of the ethanol sample. This will give you the concentration of the impurities in the sample.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the impurity concentration in the ethanol sample using NMR spectroscopy. Keep in mind that this method assumes that the impurities have distinct and non-overlapping peaks in the NMR spectrum. If the impurities have overlapping peaks with ethanol or each other, additional experiments or techniques may be necessary to accurately determine the impurity concentration."
