    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for the two media (air and water in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nn1 = 1.00 (index of refraction of air)\nn2 = 1.33 (index of refraction of water)\nθ1 = 30 degrees (incident angle)\n\nWe need to find θ2 (angle of refraction). Plugging the values into Snell's Law:\n\n1.00 * sin(30) = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.33 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.33\nθ2 = arcsin(0.5 / 1.33)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ2 ≈ 21.8 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction for the beam of light traveling from air into water at an incident angle of 30 degrees is approximately 21.8 degrees."
