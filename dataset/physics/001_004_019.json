    "message_2": "The energy difference between the first (n=1) and second (n=2) energy levels in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for energy levels:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level and eV (electron volts) is the unit of energy.\n\nFor the first energy level (n=1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the second energy level (n=2):\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference between these two levels:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the first and second energy levels in a hydrogen atom when an electron transition occurs is 10.2 eV."
