    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during a black hole merger, we can use the following information:\n\n1. Masses of the black holes: M1 and M2\n2. Distance between the black holes: R\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M\n\nNext, we can calculate the characteristic frequency (f) of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (8 * π * G * M)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * μ * R) / (c^2 * D)\n\nwhere D is the distance from the observer to the black hole merger.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during a black hole merger can be calculated using the masses of the black holes, the distance between them, and the distance from the observer to the merger. Keep in mind that these calculations are based on general relativity and assume that the black holes are non-spinning and in a circular orbit. More complex models would be needed to account for spinning black holes or eccentric orbits."
