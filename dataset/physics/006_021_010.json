    "message_2": "The Bethe-Bloch formula describes the energy loss of a charged particle as it passes through a specific material. The formula is given by:\n\n-(dE/dx) = K * z^2 * Z/A * (1/v^2) * [ln(2 * me * c^2 * v^2 * beta^2 / I * (1 - beta^2)) - beta^2]\n\nwhere:\n- dE/dx is the energy loss per unit distance (MeV/cm or similar units)\n- K is a constant, equal to 0.307075 MeV * cm^2 / mol\n- z is the charge of the particle (in units of the elementary charge e)\n- Z is the atomic number of the material\n- A is the atomic mass of the material (in g/mol)\n- v is the velocity of the particle\n- c is the speed of light\n- me is the electron mass (0.511 MeV/c^2)\n- beta = v/c (dimensionless)\n- I is the mean excitation energy of the material (in eV)\n\nTo find the range of energy loss, you need to integrate the Bethe-Bloch formula over the distance the particle travels through the material. This can be a complex task, as the energy loss is not constant and depends on the particle's velocity, which changes as it loses energy.\n\nIn practice, the range of energy loss is often determined experimentally or through simulations, as the Bethe-Bloch formula is an approximation and may not accurately describe the energy loss in all cases. Additionally, the range can be affected by factors such as the particle's initial energy, the density and thickness of the material, and the presence of other particles or radiation."
