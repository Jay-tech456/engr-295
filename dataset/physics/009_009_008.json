    "message_2": "To find the distance between the object and its image, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (do) is 15 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(15 + 10) / (15 * 10) = 25 / 150\n\nNow, subtract 1/15 from both sides:\n\n1/10 - 1/15 = 25 / 150 - 10 / 150 = 15 / 150\n\nNow, we can find the reciprocal of the fraction on the right side to find the image distance (di):\n\ndi = 150 / 15 = 10 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is 10 cm. Since the object is 15 cm away from the mirror and the image is 10 cm away from the mirror, the distance between the object and its image is:\n\n15 cm + 10 cm = 25 cm\n\nTherefore, the distance between the object and its upright image is 25 cm."
