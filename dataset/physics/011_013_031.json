    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) * Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nThe cross-sectional area (A) of the wire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * (d/2)^2\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the wire.\n\nFirst, let's find the cross-sectional area:\n\nA = π * (2.5 * 10^(-3) m / 2)^2\nA ≈ 3.1416 * (1.25 * 10^(-3) m)^2\nA ≈ 4.9087 * 10^(-6) m^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance of the wire:\n\nR = (1.72 * 10^(-8) Ω*m) * (3 m) / (4.9087 * 10^(-6) m^2)\nR ≈ 1.051 * 10^(-2) Ω\n\nFinally, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nSince ρ = R * A / L, we can rewrite the formula for conductivity as:\n\nσ = L / (R * A)\n\nσ = (3 m) / ((1.051 * 10^(-2) Ω) * (4.9087 * 10^(-6) m^2))\nσ ≈ 5.797 * 10^7 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.797 * 10^7 S/m at 25°C."
