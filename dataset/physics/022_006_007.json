    "message_2": "Dark matter has a significant effect on the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. The rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, we would expect the velocities to decrease as we move further away from the center, similar to how planets in our solar system follow Kepler's laws.\n\nHowever, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotation curves remain flat or even slightly increase at large distances from the center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter alone suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component that is influencing the motion of stars and gas in the outer regions of the galaxy. This unseen mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is believed to interact only through gravity and possibly through weak nuclear force. The presence of dark matter in a galaxy creates an additional gravitational force that affects the motion of stars and gas, causing them to move at higher velocities than expected based on the visible matter alone.\n\nIn a spiral galaxy, dark matter is distributed in a roughly spherical halo that surrounds the visible galactic disk. This dark matter halo extends well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and has a much larger mass than the visible matter in the galaxy. The gravitational influence of the dark matter halo causes the stars and gas in the outer regions of the galactic disk to move at higher velocities, resulting in the observed flat or slightly increasing rotation curves.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter and normal matter in the galactic disk is primarily through gravity. Dark matter does not interact with normal matter through electromagnetic forces, so it does not emit, absorb, or scatter light. This means that dark matter does not directly affect the visible appearance of the galaxy or the behavior of the normal matter in the disk, other than through its gravitational influence on the motion of stars and gas.\n\nIn summary, dark matter has a significant effect on the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way by causing stars and gas in the outer regions of the galaxy to move at higher velocities than expected based on visible matter alone. This is due to the additional gravitational force exerted by the dark matter halo that surrounds the galactic disk. The interaction between dark matter and normal matter in the galactic disk is primarily through gravity, as dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation."
