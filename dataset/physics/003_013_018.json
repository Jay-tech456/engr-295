    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the z-axis, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is circular and lies in the xy-plane, we can parameterize it using the angle θ as follows:\n\nx = R * cos(θ)\ny = R * sin(θ)\nz = 0\n\nThe infinitesimal length dl can be expressed as:\n\ndl = R * dθ * (-sin(θ), cos(θ), 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the position vector r from the current element to the point P:\n\nr = (x, y, z) - (0, 0, z) = (R * cos(θ), R * sin(θ), -z)\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((R * cos(θ))^2 + (R * sin(θ))^2 + z^2) = sqrt(R^2 + z^2)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = R * dθ * (-sin(θ), cos(θ), 0) x (R * cos(θ), R * sin(θ), -z)\n       = R^2 * dθ * (-z * cos(θ), -z * sin(θ), 0)\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field dB is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * |dl x r|) / r^3\n   = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * R^2 * dθ * z) / (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at the point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire loop (from θ = 0 to θ = 2π):\n\nB = ∫(dB) = (μ₀ * I * R^2 * z) / (4π * (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2)) * ∫(dθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2 * z) / (4π * (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2)) * 2π\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2 * z) / (2 * (R^2 + z^2)^(3/2))\n\nSince z is much greater than R (z >> R), we can approximate the expression as:\n\nB ≈ (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * z^3)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the z-axis, and since the current is flowing counterclockwise when viewed from the positive z-axis, the magnetic field is in the positive z-direction (using the right-hand rule).\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the z-axis, a distance z away from the origin, has a magnitude of approximately (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * z^3) and is in the positive z-direction."
