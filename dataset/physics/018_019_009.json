    "message_2": "As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the most precise measurement of the mass of the top quark was achieved by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The combined result of their measurements, published in 2019, determined the mass of the top quark to be 172.25 ± 0.41 (statistical) ± 0.65 (systematic) GeV/c².\n\nThis measurement was obtained by analyzing the data collected from proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The top quark is produced in these collisions and decays almost immediately into other particles. By studying the properties of these decay products, the mass of the top quark can be inferred.\n\nThe ATLAS and CMS experiments used different techniques to measure the top quark mass, including the template method, the matrix element method, and the ideogram method. These methods involve comparing the observed data to theoretical predictions for various top quark masses and finding the mass value that best fits the data.\n\nIt is important to note that the precision of the top quark mass measurement may have improved since my last update, so it is always a good idea to check the latest results from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for the most up-to-date information."
