    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the mirror\nu = object distance (distance from the object to the mirror)\nv = image distance (distance from the image to the mirror)\nM = magnification\n\nGiven:\nObject height (h_o) = 5 cm\nObject distance (u) = -25 cm (negative sign because the object is on the left side of the mirror)\nFocal length (f) = -20 cm (negative sign because it's a concave mirror)\n\nFirst, we need to find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-20) = 1/(-25) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(-25 - 20) / (20 * 25) = 1/v\n-45 / 500 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 500 / 45\nv ≈ -11.11 cm (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is typical for a concave mirror.\n\nNext, we'll find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -(-11.11) / (-25)\nM ≈ 0.444 (rounded to 3 decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the image height (h_i) using the magnification:\n\nh_i = M * h_o\nh_i = 0.444 * 5\nh_i ≈ 2.22 cm (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nSo, the size of the image formed by the 5 cm tall object placed 25 cm away from the concave mirror with a focal length of 20 cm is approximately 2.22 cm."
