If the rest mass of the particle is 5 × 10^-27 kg, determine the relativistic factor and the final velocity of the particle.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the energy gained by the particle when it is accelerated through the potential difference of 10,000 volts. The energy gained can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = qV\n\nwhere E is the energy gained, q is the charge of the particle, and V is the potential difference. Since the particle is not specified, we will assume it is an electron. The charge of an electron is approximately -1.6 × 10^-19 C. Therefore, the energy gained by the electron is:\n\nE = (-1.6 × 10^-19 C)(10,000 V) = -1.6 × 10^-15 J\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the electron is gaining energy as it moves through the potential difference.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the relativistic factor, also known as the Lorentz factor, which is given by the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s). To find the final velocity of the particle, we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = K / (mc^2) + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the energy gained, rest mass, and speed of light:\n\nγ = (-1.6 × 10^-15 J) / ((5 × 10^-27 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2) + 1 ≈ 1.000035\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can use it to find the final velocity of the particle. Rearranging the Lorentz factor formula to solve for the velocity:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (1 / γ^2))\n\nv = (3 × 10^8 m/s) * sqrt(1 - (1 / 1.000035^2)) ≈ 2.76 × 10^7 m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic factor (Lorentz factor) is approximately 1.000035, and the final velocity of the particle is approximately 2.76 × 10^7 m/s."
