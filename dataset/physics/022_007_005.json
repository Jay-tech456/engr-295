    "message_2": "To estimate the detection rate of dark matter particles in a hypothetical detector, we need to consider several factors, including the local dark matter density, the cross-section of WIMP-nucleon interaction, the mass of the detector, and the exposure time. The detection rate (R) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nR = ρ × σ × N × A × t\n\nwhere:\n- ρ is the local dark matter density (typically assumed to be around 0.3 GeV/cm³)\n- σ is the cross-section of WIMP-nucleon interaction (this value is unknown and depends on the specific dark matter model)\n- N is the number of target nuclei in the detector (depends on the detector's mass and the atomic mass of the target material)\n- A is the detector's acceptance (the fraction of events that pass the detector's selection criteria)\n- t is the exposure time (the time during which the detector is collecting data)\n\nTo obtain a more specific estimate, you would need to provide values for the cross-section of WIMP-nucleon interaction, the mass of the detector, and the exposure time. Additionally, the detector's acceptance would need to be determined based on its design and performance characteristics."
