    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula, which is the maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine operating between two temperatures:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold and T_hot are the absolute temperatures (in Kelvin) of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperatures to Kelvin:\n\nT1_cold = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K\nT1_hot = 127°C + 273.15 = 400.15 K\n\nT2_cold = 127°C + 273.15 = 400.15 K\nT2_hot = 400°C + 273.15 = 673.15 K\n\nNow, let's calculate the Carnot efficiency for the first case (127°C and 27°C):\n\nCarnot efficiency 1 = 1 - (T1_cold / T1_hot) = 1 - (300.15 / 400.15) ≈ 0.25 (25%)\n\nSince the actual efficiency of the engine is 60% of the maximum (Carnot) efficiency, we can find the actual efficiency for the first case:\n\nActual efficiency 1 = 0.60 * Carnot efficiency 1 = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15 (15%)\n\nNow, let's calculate the Carnot efficiency for the second case (400°C and 127°C):\n\nCarnot efficiency 2 = 1 - (T2_cold / T2_hot) = 1 - (400.15 / 673.15) ≈ 0.405 (40.5%)\n\nSince the actual efficiency of the engine remains the same (60% of the maximum efficiency), we can find the actual efficiency for the second case:\n\nActual efficiency 2 = 0.60 * Carnot efficiency 2 = 0.60 * 0.405 ≈ 0.243 (24.3%)\n\nSo, the engine's efficiency when operating between temperatures 400°C and 127°C would be approximately 24.3%."
