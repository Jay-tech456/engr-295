    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the observed rotation curve of a spiral galaxy, providing strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe.\n\nIn a spiral galaxy, stars and other celestial objects orbit around the galactic center. According to classical Newtonian physics, the velocity of these objects should decrease as we move further away from the galactic center, similar to how planets in our solar system orbit the Sun. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the visible mass in the galaxy should decrease with distance.\n\nHowever, when astronomers and physicists observed the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, they found something unexpected. Instead of the velocities decreasing with distance, they found that the velocities of stars and gas clouds remained relatively constant or even increased slightly at larger distances from the galactic center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected curves based on visible mass is known as the \"galaxy rotation problem.\"\n\nDark matter provides a solution to this problem. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and its presence can affect the motion of celestial objects. If a significant amount of dark matter is present in a galaxy, it can alter the expected rotation curve.\n\nThe presence of dark matter in a galaxy creates an additional gravitational force that extends beyond the visible mass. This additional force can explain the observed flat or slightly increasing rotation curves in spiral galaxies, as the combined gravitational forces of both visible and dark matter result in higher velocities at larger distances from the galactic center.\n\nThe fact that the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be explained by the presence of dark matter strongly supports the existence of dark matter in the universe. Moreover, other independent lines of evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure formation, and gravitational lensing, also point towards the existence of dark matter, further strengthening the case for its presence in the universe."
