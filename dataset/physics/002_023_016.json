    "message_2": "To find the vapor pressure of ethanol at 25°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and T1 are the vapor pressure and temperature at the standard boiling point, P2 and T2 are the vapor pressure and temperature at the desired conditions, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 78.29°C + 273.15 = 351.44 K\nT2 = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nThe standard boiling point of ethanol is 78.29°C, which corresponds to a vapor pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). So, P1 = 101.325 kPa.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -38.56 * 10^3 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298.15 - 1/351.44)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-38.56 * 10^3 / (8.314) * (1/298.15 - 1/351.44))\nP2 ≈ 5.93 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of ethanol at 25°C is approximately 5.93 kPa."
