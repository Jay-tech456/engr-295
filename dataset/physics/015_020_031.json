    "message_2": "As a binary system of white dwarfs evolves, the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by the system change due to the loss of energy and angular momentum carried away by the gravitational waves. This causes the white dwarfs to spiral inwards and their orbital period to decrease, leading to an increase in the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the white dwarfs, their separation, and the inclination angle of the binary system with respect to the observer. As the white dwarfs spiral inwards, their separation decreases, which leads to an increase in the amplitude of the gravitational waves.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by a binary system of white dwarfs can be expressed as:\n\nf = (1/π) * (G * (M1 + M2) / (4 * a^3))^(1/2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the white dwarfs, and a is the semi-major axis of their orbit.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves can be expressed as:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (π * f)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system (a combination of the masses of the white dwarfs), f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, and d is the distance to the binary system.\n\nFor a binary system of white dwarfs to be detectable by current gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO, the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves need to be within the sensitive range of the detectors. LIGO is most sensitive to frequencies between ~10 Hz and ~1000 Hz, with the peak sensitivity around 100 Hz.\n\nBinary systems of white dwarfs typically emit gravitational waves at lower frequencies compared to binary systems of neutron stars or black holes, which are the primary targets for LIGO. However, under certain conditions, such as when the white dwarfs are relatively massive, have a small separation, and are at a relatively close distance to Earth, their emitted gravitational waves could potentially be detectable by LIGO or future gravitational wave observatories with improved low-frequency sensitivity, such as LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)."
