    "message_2": "To find the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at 100°C, we will use the formula:\n\nQ = m * L\n\nwhere Q is the energy required, m is the mass of water, and L is the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of water from grams to moles. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol. \n\nmoles of water = (50 g) / (18.015 g/mol) = 2.775 moles\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the energy required:\n\nQ = (2.775 moles) * (40.7 kJ/mol) = 112.9425 kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to vaporize 50 grams of water at 100°C is approximately 112.94 kJ."
