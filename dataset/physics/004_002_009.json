    "message_2": "In the theory of general relativity, the mass and spin of a black hole play crucial roles in determining the shape and size of its event horizon. The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. The properties of the event horizon are determined by the black hole's mass (M) and angular momentum (spin, J).\n\nThere are two main types of black holes based on their spin: non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black holes and rotating (Kerr) black holes.\n\n1. Non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black holes:\nFor a non-rotating black hole, the event horizon is a perfect sphere, and its size is determined solely by its mass. The radius of the event horizon, called the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. The larger the mass, the larger the Schwarzschild radius, and thus the larger the event horizon.\n\n2. Rotating (Kerr) black holes:\nFor a rotating black hole, the situation is more complex. The spin of the black hole causes space-time to be dragged around it, a phenomenon known as frame-dragging. This leads to an oblate spheroidal shape of the event horizon, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nThe size and shape of the event horizon for a Kerr black hole are determined by both its mass and spin. The radius of the event horizon in this case can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - (GJ/c)^2/M^2)\n\nwhere R+ is the radius of the outer event horizon, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, J is the angular momentum (spin), and c is the speed of light.\n\nAs the spin of the black hole increases, the event horizon becomes more oblate, and the radius at the poles decreases while the radius at the equator increases. If the spin were to reach its maximum possible value (the black hole becomes \"extremal\"), the event horizon would become infinitely flattened, and the radius at the poles would be zero.\n\nIn summary, the mass and spin of a black hole significantly affect the shape and size of its event horizon. A non-rotating black hole has a spherical event horizon, while a rotating black hole has an oblate spheroidal event horizon. The size of the event horizon increases with the mass of the black hole, and its shape becomes more oblate as the spin increases."
