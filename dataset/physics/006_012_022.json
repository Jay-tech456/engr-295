    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a neutral helium atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom:\n\nE_n = -Z^2 * R_H / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number of the element, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 13.6 eV), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor helium, Z = 2, and we are considering the ground state, so n = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nE_1 = -2^2 * 13.6 eV / 1^2\nE_1 = -4 * 13.6 eV\nE_1 = -54.4 eV\n\nThe energy of the first excited state (n = 2) can also be calculated using the same formula:\n\nE_2 = -2^2 * 13.6 eV / 2^2\nE_2 = -4 * 13.6 eV / 4\nE_2 = -13.6 eV\n\nNow, we are given that the energy required to excite helium from its ground state to its first excited state is 19.82 eV. This means that the difference between the first excited state and the ground state is 19.82 eV:\n\nE_2 - E_1 = 19.82 eV\n\nSubstituting the values of E_1 and E_2, we get:\n\n(-13.6 eV) - (-54.4 eV) = 19.82 eV\n\nSolving for the ionization energy (E_1):\n\nE_1 = 54.4 eV - 19.82 eV\nE_1 â‰ˆ 34.58 eV\n\nTherefore, the ionization energy of a neutral helium atom in its ground state is approximately 34.58 electron volts."
