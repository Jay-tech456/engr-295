    "message_2": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment, electrons are accelerated through a gas-filled tube by applying an accelerating voltage. The electrons collide with gas atoms, and if they have enough energy, they can excite the gas atoms to a higher energy state. The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is a fixed value, which is characteristic of the gas used in the experiment.\n\nWhen the accelerating voltage is increased, the electrons gain more kinetic energy. If the kinetic energy of the electrons is greater than or equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the gas atoms, the electrons can transfer their energy to the gas atoms, causing them to become excited. This results in a decrease in the number of electrons reaching the detector, which is observed as a dip in the current.\n\nAs the accelerating voltage is further increased, the electrons gain even more kinetic energy, and they can excite the gas atoms multiple times before reaching the detector. This leads to a series of dips in the current, which are separated by a constant voltage difference. This voltage difference corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the gas atoms, and can be used to determine the energy levels of the gas.\n\nIn summary, varying the accelerating voltage in the Franck-Hertz experiment affects the measured electron energy by changing the kinetic energy of the electrons. When the accelerating voltage is increased, the electrons gain more kinetic energy, and they can excite the gas atoms multiple times, leading to a series of dips in the current. The voltage difference between these dips corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the gas atoms, which can be used to determine the energy levels of the gas."
