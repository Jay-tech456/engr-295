    "message_2": "A star with a mass 10 times that of the Sun will have a significantly shorter lifetime than the Sun due to its higher mass. The lifetime of a star is roughly proportional to its mass divided by its luminosity. More massive stars have higher luminosities, which means they burn through their nuclear fuel more quickly. A star's lifetime can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nLifetime ≈ (Mass / Luminosity) × 10^10 years\n\nFor a star with a mass 10 times that of the Sun, its luminosity is approximately 10^3.5 times that of the Sun. Using the formula above, we can estimate the star's lifetime:\n\nLifetime ≈ (10 / 10^3.5) × 10^10 years ≈ 3.16 × 10^6 years\n\nSo, the approximate lifetime of a star with a mass 10 times that of the Sun is around 3.16 million years.\n\nThroughout its lifetime, the star will undergo nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium. This process releases energy in the form of light and heat, which counteracts the force of gravity trying to collapse the star. As the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will start fusing helium into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. This process will continue with progressively heavier elements until the core is mostly composed of iron.\n\nAt this point, the star will no longer be able to generate energy through nuclear fusion, as fusing iron requires more energy than it produces. The core will then start to collapse under the force of gravity, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool, forming a red supergiant.\n\nThe final fate of the star depends on its mass. For a star with a mass 10 times that of the Sun, its core will continue to collapse until it reaches a critical density, triggering a core-collapse supernova explosion. This powerful explosion will eject the outer layers of the star into space, leaving behind a compact remnant – either a neutron star or, if the core mass is above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit (around 2-3 solar masses), a black hole.\n\nIn summary, a star with a mass 10 times that of the Sun will have a lifetime of approximately 3.16 million years. Its evolution will be driven by nuclear fusion and gravitational collapse, ultimately leading to a supernova explosion and the formation of either a neutron star or a black hole."
