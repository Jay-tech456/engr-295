    "message_1": "A toroidal coil has an inner radius of 5 cm and an outer radius of 8 cm. It has 800 turns and carries a current of 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field inside and outside the toroid at a radial distance of 6 cm from the center of the toroid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside and outside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current passing through the loop.\n\nFor a toroidal coil, the magnetic field is in the circumferential direction, and its magnitude can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the radial distance from the center of the toroid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field inside the toroid at a radial distance of 6 cm (0.06 m) from the center:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 800 turns * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.06 m)\n\nB_inside = (1.6 × 10^(-3) Tm²) / (0.06 m)\n\nB_inside ≈ 0.0267 T (Tesla)\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field outside the toroid at a radial distance of 6 cm (0.06 m) from the center. Since the toroid has a closed magnetic field, the magnetic field outside the toroid is zero.\n\nB_outside = 0 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the toroid at a radial distance of 6 cm from the center is approximately 0.0267 T, and the magnetic field outside the toroid at the same distance is 0 T."
