    "message_1": "A tube of diameter 2 cm is used to supply water to a house. The water is supplied by a pump located at the ground level, and needs to be transported to a tank located on the rooftop, which is at a height of 10 m. Assuming that the pipe is horizontal and there are no losses due to friction, what is the maximum flow rate (in liters per minute) that can be supplied by the pump?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bernoulli's equation, which states that the total mechanical energy per unit volume of an ideal fluid remains constant along a streamline. The equation is given by:\n\nP1/ρ + 0.5*v1^2 + g*h1 = P2/ρ + 0.5*v2^2 + g*h2\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the pressures at the ground level and the rooftop, respectively, ρ is the density of water, v1 and v2 are the velocities of water at the ground level and the rooftop, respectively, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h1 and h2 are the heights at the ground level and the rooftop, respectively.\n\nSince the pipe is horizontal, h1 = 0 and h2 = 10 m. Also, we can assume that the pressure at the rooftop is atmospheric pressure, so P2 = 0. The density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m^3, and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s^2.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Bernoulli's equation to find the velocity of water at the ground level (v1):\n\nv1^2 = 2*g*h2\n\nv1 = sqrt(2*9.81*10) = sqrt(196.2) ≈ 14 m/s\n\nNow that we have the velocity of water at the ground level, we can find the flow rate (Q) using the formula:\n\nQ = A*v1\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The diameter of the pipe is 2 cm, so the radius is 1 cm or 0.01 m. The cross-sectional area of the pipe is given by:\n\nA = π*r^2 = π*(0.01)^2 = 0.000314 m^2\n\nNow, we can find the flow rate:\n\nQ = 0.000314 * 14 = 0.004396 m^3/s\n\nTo convert the flow rate to liters per minute, we can use the conversion factor 1 m^3 = 1000 L and 1 minute = 60 seconds:\n\nQ = 0.004396 * 1000 * 60 = 263.76 L/min\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow rate that can be supplied by the pump is approximately 263.76 liters per minute."
