    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a particle with mass m and energy E is given by the Klein-Gordon equation. In natural units (ħ = c = 1), the equation is:\n\n(∂^2_t - ∇^2 + m^2)ψ = 0\n\nwhere ψ is the wave function of the particle, ∂_t is the time derivative, and ∇^2 is the Laplacian operator.\n\nTo show that this equation reduces to the classical wave equation at low energies, we need to consider the non-relativistic limit. In this limit, the energy E is much smaller than the rest mass energy (mc^2), so E ≈ (1/2)mv^2, where v is the non-relativistic velocity of the particle.\n\nThe non-relativistic limit corresponds to the Schrödinger equation, which is given by:\n\n(-ħ^2/(2m))∇^2ψ + Vψ = iħ(∂_tψ)\n\nIn the free particle case (V = 0), the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n(-ħ^2/(2m))∇^2ψ = iħ(∂_tψ)\n\nNow, let's compare this to the Klein-Gordon equation. In the non-relativistic limit, we can write the energy E as:\n\nE = √(p^2c^2 + m^2c^4) ≈ mc^2 + (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the particle. In natural units, this becomes:\n\nE ≈ m + (1/2)p^2/m\n\nNow, let's substitute the energy-momentum relation into the Klein-Gordon equation:\n\n(∂^2_t - ∇^2 + m^2)ψ = 0\n\nUsing E = iħ(∂_t) and p = -iħ∇, we get:\n\n[(E - m)^2 - p^2]ψ = 0\n\nSubstituting the non-relativistic energy expression, we have:\n\n[((1/2)p^2/m)^2 - p^2]ψ = 0\n\nDividing by p^2 and multiplying by -2m/ħ^2, we obtain:\n\n(-ħ^2/(2m))∇^2ψ = iħ(∂_tψ)\n\nThis is the same as the free particle Schrödinger equation, so the Klein-Gordon equation reduces to the classical wave equation at low energies.\n\nTo calculate the speed of a particle with mass m and energy E, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the particle. The relativistic momentum is given by:\n\np = mv / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSquaring both sides and rearranging for v^2, we get:\n\nv^2 = (p^2c^2) / (m^2c^4 + p^2c^2)\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum relation to substitute for p^2c^2:\n\nv^2 = (E^2 - m^2c^4) / (m^2c^4 + (E^2 - m^2c^4))\n\nv^2 = (E^2 - m^2c^4) / E^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nv = c√(1 - (m^2c^4) / E^2)\n\nThis is the speed of a particle with mass m and energy E in terms of the speed of light c."
