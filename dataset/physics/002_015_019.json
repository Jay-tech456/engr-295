    "message_1": "A heat pump has a coefficient of performance of 3.2 when operating between a cold reservoir at 5°C and a warm reservoir at 35°C. Determine the amount of work input required by the heat pump to transfer 1200 J of heat from the cold reservoir to the warm reservoir.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the warm reservoir (Q_w) to the work input (W) required to transfer that heat:\n\nCOP = Q_w / W\n\nWe are given the COP as 3.2 and the heat transferred from the cold reservoir to the warm reservoir (Q_w) as 1200 J. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the work input (W):\n\nW = Q_w / COP\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nW = 1200 J / 3.2\n\nW = 375 J\n\nTherefore, the work input required by the heat pump to transfer 1200 J of heat from the cold reservoir to the warm reservoir is 375 J."
