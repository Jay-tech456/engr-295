    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the material, we can use the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nχ = (C) / (T - θ)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. For paramagnetic materials, θ is usually close to 0, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\nχ = C / T\n\nFirst, we need to find the Curie constant (C). The Curie constant is given by:\n\nC = (N * μ²) / (3 * k)\n\nwhere N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, μ is the magnetic moment per atom, and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n\nTo find the number of magnetic moments per unit volume (N), we can use the density (ρ) and molar mass (M) of the material:\n\nN = (ρ * N_A) / M\n\nwhere N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol).\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nρ = 7.9 g/cm³ = 7.9 × 10³ kg/m³ (1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³)\nM = 58.69 g/mol\nμ = 5.4 μ_B = 5.4 × 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T (1 μ_B = 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T)\nT = 300 K\n\nFirst, we calculate N:\n\nN = (7.9 × 10³ kg/m³ * 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol) / (58.69 g/mol)\nN ≈ 8.10 × 10²⁸ atoms/m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the Curie constant (C):\n\nC = (8.10 × 10²⁸ atoms/m³ * (5.4 × 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T)²) / (3 * 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\nC ≈ 1.23 × 10⁻³ J/(T² K)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ):\n\nχ = C / T\nχ = 1.23 × 10⁻³ J/(T² K) / 300 K\nχ ≈ 4.10 × 10⁻⁶ T⁻¹\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility of the material is approximately 4.10 × 10⁻⁶ T⁻¹ at 300 K."
