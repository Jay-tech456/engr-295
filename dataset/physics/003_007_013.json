    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance R from the center of the rod, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is a small length element of the rod, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince R is much greater than L, we can approximate the rod as a point current source located at its center. In this case, the magnetic field at a distance R from the center of the rod can be found by integrating the Biot-Savart law over the length of the rod.\n\nLet's consider a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the rod and the rod aligned along the z-axis. The point where we want to find the magnetic field is on the x-axis at a distance R from the origin. We can divide the rod into small segments of length dz, and integrate the magnetic field contribution from each segment.\n\nThe position vector r from a segment at height z to the point on the x-axis is given by:\n\nr = xi - zk\n\nwhere i and k are the unit vectors along the x and z axes, respectively.\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √(x^2 + z^2) = R (since R >> L)\n\nThe cross product dl x r is given by:\n\ndl x r = (Idz)k x (xi - zk) = I(xdz)i\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the Biot-Savart law and integrate over the length of the rod:\n\nB = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫(xdz) / R^3 from -L/2 to L/2\n\nB = (μ₀I / 4π) * (x / R^3) * ∫dz from -L/2 to L/2\n\nB = (μ₀I / 4π) * (x / R^3) * L\n\nB = (μ₀IL / 4πR^3) * x\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field is:\n\n|B| = μ₀IL / 4πR^3\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the x-axis, perpendicular to the rod.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance R from the center of the rod is:\n\nB = (μ₀IL / 4πR^3) * i"
