    "message_2": "To maintain a stable orbit around a sun-like star, the gravitational force between the planet and the star must be equal to the centripetal force acting on the planet. We can use Newton's laws of motion and gravity to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's list the given information:\n- Mass of the planet (Mp) = 5 Earth masses = 5 * 5.972 × 10^24 kg = 2.986 × 10^25 kg\n- Mass of the sun-like star (Ms) = 1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10^30 kg\n- Distance between the planet and the star (r) = 1 AU = 1.496 × 10^11 m\n\nNow, we can use Newton's law of universal gravitation to find the gravitational force (Fg) between the planet and the star:\n\nFg = G * (Mp * Ms) / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, which is approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2.\n\nFg = (6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2) * (2.986 × 10^25 kg * 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (1.496 × 10^11 m)^2\nFg ≈ 8.887 × 10^22 N\n\nNow, we can use the centripetal force formula to find the required initial velocity (v) for a stable orbit:\n\nFc = (Mp * v^2) / r\n\nSince Fg = Fc, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(Mp * v^2) / r = 8.887 × 10^22 N\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv^2 = (8.887 × 10^22 N * 1.496 × 10^11 m) / 2.986 × 10^25 kg\nv^2 ≈ 4.468 × 10^15 m^2/s^2\nv ≈ 2.112 × 10^7 m/s\n\nTherefore, the initial velocity required for a planet with a mass of 5 Earth masses to maintain a stable orbit around a sun-like star at a distance of 1 AU is approximately 2.112 × 10^7 m/s."
