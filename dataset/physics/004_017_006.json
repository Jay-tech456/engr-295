Use the formula for the deflection angle of light in gravitational lensing from General Relativity to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of deflection of light as it passes near a massive object, we can use the formula for gravitational lensing from General Relativity:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)), M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and b is the impact parameter or the distance of closest approach.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the object (M) using the given gravitational field strength (g) and distance (r):\n\ng = G * M / r^2\n\nSolving for M:\n\nM = g * r^2 / G\n\nGiven g = 10^(-11) N/kg and r = 1 million kilometers (1 × 10^6 km = 1 × 10^9 m):\n\nM = (10^(-11) N/kg) * (1 × 10^9 m)^2 / (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2))\nM ≈ 1.5 × 10^11 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the deflection angle (α):\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nGiven b = r (since the distance of closest approach is the same as the distance from the object):\n\nα = (4 * (6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)) * (1.5 × 10^11 kg)) / ((3 × 10^8 m/s)^2 * (1 × 10^9 m))\nα ≈ 1.34 × 10^(-15) radians\n\nThe angle of deflection of light as it passes near the massive object is approximately 1.34 × 10^(-15) radians."
