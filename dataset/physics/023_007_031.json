We can then reconstruct the density matrix of the system using these expectation values.\n\nHere's a Python program using the Qiskit library to perform quantum state tomography on a two-qubit system:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, execute, Aer\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix, partial_trace\n\n# Define the Pauli operators\npauli_operators = ['I', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']\n\ndef prepare_unknown_state():\n    \"\"\"Prepare an unknown two-qubit state.\"\"\"\n    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)\n    qc.h(0)\n    qc.cx(0, 1)\n    return qc\n\ndef measure_pauli_operator(qc, operator, qubit):\n    \"\"\"Add measurement for the given Pauli operator.\"\"\"\n    if operator == 'X':\n        qc.h(qubit)\n    elif operator == 'Y':\n        qc.sdg(qubit)\n        qc.h(qubit)\n    elif operator == 'Z':\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid Pauli operator\")\n\ndef perform_tomography():\n    \"\"\"Perform quantum state tomography on a two-qubit system.\"\"\"\n    unknown_state = prepare_unknown_state()\n    density_matrix = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=complex)\n\n    for op1 in pauli_operators:\n        for op2 in pauli_operators:\n            if op1 == 'I' and op2 == 'I':\n                continue\n\n            # Prepare the circuit\n            qr = QuantumRegister(2)\n            cr = ClassicalRegister(2)\n            qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)\n            qc.compose(unknown_state, [qr[0], qr[1]], inplace=True)\n\n            # Measure the Pauli operators\n            measure_pauli_operator(qc, op1, 0)\n            measure_pauli_operator(qc, op2, 1)\n            qc.measure(qr, cr)\n\n            # Execute the circuit\n            backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')\n            result = execute(qc, backend, shots=8192).result()\n            counts = result.get_counts()\n\n            # Calculate the expectation value\n            expectation_value = 0\n            for outcome, count in counts.items():\n                sign = (-1) ** (int(outcome[0]) ^ int(outcome[1]))\n                expectation_value += sign * count / 8192\n\n            # Update the density matrix\n            i, j = pauli_operators.index(op1), pauli_operators.index(op2)\n            density_matrix[i, j] = 0.25 * expectation_value\n\n    return DensityMatrix(density_matrix)\n\n# Perform the tomography\nrho = perform_tomography()\nprint(\"Reconstructed density matrix:\")\nprint(rho)\n```\n\nThis program first prepares an unknown two-qubit state (in this case, a Bell state). It then measures the expectation values of all 15 independent Pauli operators and reconstructs the density matrix of the system using these values. Finally, it prints the reconstructed density matrix. Note that this program uses a simulator, so there might be small deviations from the exact state due to statistical fluctuations."
