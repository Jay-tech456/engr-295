    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nI = current in the wire = 10 A\nr = distance from the center of the wire = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T) / (0.08 m)\n\nB = 5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the wire is 5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
