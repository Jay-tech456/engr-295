    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength required to split the spectral line of a hydrogen atom into three components, we can use the formula for the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of an external magnetic field.\n\nThe formula for the Zeeman effect is:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the split spectral lines, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength, and Δm_j is the change in the magnetic quantum number.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy difference (ΔE) between the split spectral lines. We can use the formula:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the spectral line (656.28 nm).\n\nConverting the wavelength to meters:\n\nλ = 656.28 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.5628 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔE:\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.5628 x 10^-7 m) = 3.025 x 10^-19 J\n\nSince the spectral line is split into three components, there will be two energy differences (ΔE_1 and ΔE_2). We can assume that ΔE_1 = ΔE_2 = ΔE / 2:\n\nΔE_1 = ΔE_2 = 3.025 x 10^-19 J / 2 = 1.5125 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can use the Zeeman effect formula to find the magnetic field strength. Since the total angular momentum quantum number is one (j = 1), the possible values for the magnetic quantum number (m_j) are -1, 0, and 1. The splitting occurs between m_j = -1 and m_j = 1, so Δm_j = 2.\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_j\n\nB = ΔE / (μ_B * Δm_j)\n\nB = (1.5125 x 10^-19 J) / ((9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * 2) = 8.15 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength required to split the spectral line of a hydrogen atom into three components is approximately 8.15 T (tesla)."
