    "message_2": "Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a black hole, bends the path of light from a distant source, such as a star or galaxy, due to its strong gravitational field. The degree of gravitational lensing depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole, the light source, and the observer.\n\nThe mass of the black hole determines the strength of its gravitational field. A more massive black hole will have a stronger gravitational field, which will cause a greater degree of bending of light. This means that the more massive the black hole, the more pronounced the gravitational lensing effect will be.\n\nThe distance between the black hole and the light source also plays a role in the degree of gravitational lensing. If the light source is closer to the black hole, the light will have to pass through a stronger gravitational field, which will result in a greater degree of bending. Conversely, if the light source is farther away from the black hole, the light will pass through a weaker gravitational field, and the lensing effect will be less pronounced.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between the black hole and the observer also affects the degree of gravitational lensing. If the observer is closer to the black hole, they will be more likely to see the lensing effect, as the light will have to pass through a stronger gravitational field to reach them. If the observer is farther away from the black hole, the lensing effect will be less noticeable, as the light will pass through a weaker gravitational field.\n\nIn summary, the degree of gravitational lensing observed depends on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole, the light source, and the observer. A more massive black hole and shorter distances between the black hole, light source, and observer will result in a more pronounced gravitational lensing effect."
