    "message_2": "Magnetic susceptibility (χ) is a measure of how much a material becomes magnetized in response to an applied magnetic field. In a spin glass material, the magnetic moments of the individual atoms or ions are randomly oriented, leading to a complex magnetic behavior.\n\nAt low temperatures, the magnetic susceptibility of a spin glass material is typically large and positive, indicating that the material is paramagnetic. This is because the thermal energy is not sufficient to overcome the random interactions between the magnetic moments, and they remain frozen in a disordered state.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of a spin glass material can be described by the Curie-Weiss law at low temperatures:\n\nχ(T) = C / (T - θ)\n\nwhere χ(T) is the magnetic susceptibility at temperature T, C is the Curie constant, and θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. The Curie-Weiss temperature is typically negative for spin glass materials, indicating the presence of competing interactions between the magnetic moments.\n\nAs for the variation of magnetic susceptibility with the strength of the applied magnetic field (H), it is generally a non-linear relationship. In the low field regime, the susceptibility can be considered constant, and the magnetization (M) of the material is proportional to the applied field (M = χH). However, as the field strength increases, the magnetic moments start to align with the field, and the susceptibility may decrease.\n\nIn the high field regime, the magnetic susceptibility can become field-dependent, and the magnetization may no longer be proportional to the applied field. This behavior is due to the complex nature of the interactions between the magnetic moments in a spin glass material.\n\nIn summary, the magnetic susceptibility of a spin glass material at low temperatures is large and positive, indicating paramagnetic behavior. The susceptibility is described by the Curie-Weiss law and can be field-dependent, especially at high field strengths."
