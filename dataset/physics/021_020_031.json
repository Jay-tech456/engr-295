    "message_2": "The observable effects of a black hole on the interstellar medium can be categorized into several key phenomena. These effects may vary depending on the size (mass) and activity (accretion rate) of the black hole. Here are some of the main effects:\n\n1. Gravitational influence: A black hole's gravity can attract and distort the surrounding interstellar medium. This can lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the black hole, where gas and dust are pulled in and heated up due to friction and compression. The size and mass of the black hole will determine the extent of its gravitational influence.\n\n2. Accretion disk emissions: As material in the accretion disk gets heated up, it emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. The intensity and spectrum of these emissions depend on the black hole's mass and accretion rate. More massive black holes and higher accretion rates typically result in stronger emissions.\n\n3. Jets and outflows: Some black holes, particularly those with high accretion rates, can produce powerful jets of plasma and radiation that are ejected perpendicular to the accretion disk. These jets can interact with the interstellar medium, creating shockwaves and heating up the surrounding gas. The power and extent of these jets depend on the black hole's mass and activity.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: The strong gravity of a black hole can bend the path of light from background objects, creating a gravitational lensing effect. This can cause the background object to appear distorted or even produce multiple images of the object. The degree of lensing depends on the black hole's mass and distance from the background object.\n\n5. Tidal disruption events: If a star passes too close to a black hole, the tidal forces can rip the star apart, creating a bright flare of radiation as the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole. The likelihood and intensity of these events depend on the black hole's mass and the density of stars in its vicinity.\n\nIn summary, the observable effects of a black hole on the interstellar medium include gravitational influence, accretion disk emissions, jets and outflows, gravitational lensing, and tidal disruption events. These effects can vary depending on the black hole's size and activity, with more massive and active black holes generally producing more pronounced effects."
