Given that the binding energy of the silver electrons in their orbits is 4.09 eV.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - Φ\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, h is the Planck's constant (6.63 × 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident light, and Φ is the work function of the material (silver in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the ultraviolet radiation. We are given the wavelength (λ) which is 250 nm. The relationship between wavelength and frequency is given by:\n\nc = λf\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s). We can rearrange this equation to solve for the frequency:\n\nf = c / λ\n\nBefore we plug in the values, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 250 nm × (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 2.5 × 10^-7 m\n\nNow we can find the frequency:\n\nf = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (2.5 × 10^-7 m) = 1.2 × 10^15 Hz\n\nNow we can use the photoelectric effect equation to find the maximum kinetic energy:\n\nK_max = (6.63 × 10^-34 Js) × (1.2 × 10^15 Hz) - 4.73 eV\n\nK_max = 7.956 × 10^-19 J - 4.73 eV\n\nTo compare the energies, we need to convert the energy from Joules to electron volts (eV). We know that 1 eV = 1.6 × 10^-19 J, so:\n\nK_max = (7.956 × 10^-19 J) × (1 eV / 1.6 × 10^-19 J) - 4.73 eV\n\nK_max ≈ 4.97 eV - 4.73 eV\n\nK_max ≈ 0.24 eV\n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons from silver atoms irradiated with ultraviolet radiation of wavelength 250 nm is approximately 0.24 eV."
