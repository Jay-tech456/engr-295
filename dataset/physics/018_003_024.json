    "message_2": "To calculate the likelihood of a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons, we need to know the branching ratio for this decay mode. The branching ratio for Higgs boson (H) decaying into a pair of W bosons (W⁺W⁻) is approximately 21.5%.\n\nNow, we need to determine the production cross-section of the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The production cross-section for Higgs boson at 13 TeV is approximately 55 pb (picobarns).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the effective cross-section for the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons. This can be done by multiplying the production cross-section by the branching ratio:\n\nEffective cross-section = Production cross-section × Branching ratio\nEffective cross-section = 55 pb × 0.215\nEffective cross-section ≈ 11.825 pb\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of expected events by multiplying the effective cross-section by the integrated luminosity:\n\nNumber of expected events = Effective cross-section × Integrated luminosity\nNumber of expected events = 11.825 pb × 80 fb⁻¹\nNumber of expected events ≈ 11.825 × 10⁻³ fb × 80 fb⁻¹\nNumber of expected events ≈ 947\n\nSo, we expect approximately 947 Higgs boson events decaying into a pair of W bosons in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 80 fb⁻¹.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of the observation, we need to know the background events (B) and the signal events (S). In this case, the signal events are the expected Higgs boson events decaying into a pair of W bosons (S ≈ 947). The background events depend on the specific analysis and selection criteria, which are not provided in the problem. However, assuming a good signal-to-background ratio, the statistical significance can be estimated as:\n\nStatistical significance = S / √(S + B)\n\nWith the given information, we cannot provide an exact value for the statistical significance, but with a high number of expected events (S ≈ 947), the statistical significance is expected to be high, allowing for a clear observation of the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons."
