    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) passing through the loop.\n\nIn this case, we are dealing with a solenoid (a coil of wire), so we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/meter), and I is the current (Amperes).\n\nGiven:\nn = 100 turns/meter\nI = 5 A\nL = 2 meters (length of the solenoid)\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (100 turns/m) * (5 A)\nB_inside = 2π × 10^(-5) T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at point P, which is located 10 cm (0.1 m) away from the center of the solenoid on its axis. Since the magnetic field outside a solenoid is much weaker than inside, we can use the formula for the magnetic field outside an ideal solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * n * I * L^2) / (2 * (L^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere x is the distance from the center of the solenoid to point P.\n\nx = 0.1 m\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (100 turns/m) * (5 A) * (2 m)^2 / (2 * ((2 m)^2 + (0.1 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nB_outside ≈ 1.96 × 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.96 × 10^(-5) T."
