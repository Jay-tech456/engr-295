    "message_1": "A current-carrying motor consists of a loop of wire with a radius of 5 cm and 20 turns. If the current in the wire is 2 A, what is the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * A) / (2 * R³)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, A is the area of the loop, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the loop:\n\nA = π * R²\nA = π * (0.05 m)²\nA ≈ 0.00785 m²\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A * 20 * 0.00785 m²) / (2 * (0.05 m)³)\nB ≈ (3.14 × 10⁻⁶ Tm² * 2 * 20 * 0.00785) / (2 * 0.000125 m³)\nB ≈ (0.0000628 T) / (0.000125 m³)\nB ≈ 0.5024 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 0.5024 T (tesla)."
