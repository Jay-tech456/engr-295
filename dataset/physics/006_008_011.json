    "message_2": "To determine the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted from the cesium metal surface, we will use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - Φ\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident photon, and Φ is the work function of the cesium metal.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the incident photon. We are given the wavelength (λ) of the photon, which is 450 nm. We can convert this to meters:\n\nλ = 450 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 450 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can use the speed of light (c) to find the frequency:\n\nc = λf\n\nf = c / λ\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (450 x 10^-9 m) = 6.67 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can find the energy of the incident photon using the Planck's constant:\n\nE_photon = hf = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (6.67 x 10^14 Hz) = 4.42 x 10^-19 J\n\nTo make calculations easier, let's convert the energy to electron volts (eV). We know that 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J, so:\n\nE_photon = (4.42 x 10^-19 J) / (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.76 eV\n\nNow we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons using the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = E_photon - Φ = 2.76 eV - 1.9 eV = 0.86 eV\n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted from the cesium metal surface is 0.86 eV."
