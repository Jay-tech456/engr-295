    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section (σ) for an electron incident on hydrogen atoms can be calculated using the Mott formula:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z * e²)² / (16 * E₀² * sin⁴(θ/2)) * (1 - β² * sin²(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- Z is the atomic number of the target (hydrogen has Z = 1)\n- e is the elementary charge (e ≈ 1.602 × 10^(-19) C)\n- E₀ is the initial energy of the electron (1 keV = 1000 eV)\n- θ is the scattering angle (60 degrees)\n- β is the ratio of the electron's speed to the speed of light (β = v/c)\n\nFirst, we need to find the electron's speed (v) using its energy (E₀). We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (m₀ * c²)² + (p * c)²\n\nwhere:\n- E is the total energy of the electron\n- m₀ is the electron's rest mass (m₀ ≈ 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\n- c is the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- p is the electron's momentum\n\nSince E₀ = E - m₀ * c², we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(E₀ + m₀ * c²)² = (m₀ * c²)² + (p * c)²\n\nSolving for p:\n\np = sqrt(((E₀ + m₀ * c²)² - (m₀ * c²)²) / c²)\n\nNow we can find the electron's speed (v) using the momentum:\n\nv = p * c² / (sqrt(m₀² * c⁴ + p² * c²))\n\nNext, we can calculate β:\n\nβ = v / c\n\nFinally, we can plug all the values into the Mott formula to find the scattering cross section:\n\nσ(60°) = (1 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)²) / (16 * (1000 eV)² * sin⁴(60°/2)) * (1 - β² * sin²(60°/2))\n\nNote that the result will be in units of m². To convert it to the more commonly used unit of barns (1 barn = 10^(-28) m²), multiply the result by 10^(28)."
