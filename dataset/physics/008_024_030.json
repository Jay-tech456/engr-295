    "message_2": "The W' boson is a hypothetical particle that is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. It is a heavier version of the W boson, which is responsible for the weak nuclear force. The mass range of the W' boson is not yet known, as it has not been directly observed in experiments. However, based on current experimental limits and theoretical predictions, we can estimate its mass range.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been searching for evidence of the W' boson through high-energy proton-proton collisions. So far, no direct evidence has been found, which allows us to set lower limits on its mass. As of now, the lower limit for the W' boson mass is around 4.5 to 5 TeV (teraelectronvolts), depending on the specific model and decay channels considered.\n\nOn the other hand, theoretical predictions for the mass of the W' boson can vary significantly depending on the specific model or extension of the Standard Model being considered. Some models predict masses in the range of a few TeV, while others predict masses up to tens of TeV.\n\nIn summary, the expected mass range of a hypothetical W' boson is not well-defined due to the lack of experimental evidence and the variety of theoretical models. However, based on current experimental limits, we can say that its mass should be above 4.5 to 5 TeV. The upper limit is less constrained and could be in the range of tens of TeV, depending on the specific theoretical model. Further experimental searches at the LHC and future high-energy colliders will help to narrow down the mass range and potentially discover the W' boson if it exists."
