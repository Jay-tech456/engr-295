    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we will use the following formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nwhere ΔH_combustion is the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction, ΔH_f is the standard enthalpy of formation, and the Σ symbol represents the sum of the enthalpies of formation for all the products and reactants.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpies of formation for the products and reactants involved in the reaction. We are given the standard enthalpy of formation for CH4 (-74.8 kJ/mol). We also need the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 (g) and H2O (l). These values are:\n\nΔH_f(CO2) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(H2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔH_combustion = [1 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [1 × (-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2 × 0 kJ/mol]\n\nNote that the enthalpy of formation for O2 (g) is 0 kJ/mol because it is in its standard state.\n\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 2 × 285.8 + 74.8) kJ/mol\nΔH_combustion = (-393.5 - 571.6 + 74.8) kJ/mol\nΔH_combustion = (-964.3 + 74.8) kJ/mol\nΔH_combustion = -889.5 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) is -889.5 kJ/mol."
