    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) processes are highly suppressed. The process $\\mu^-\\rightarrow e^- e^+ e^-$ is a LFV process, as it involves the conversion of a muon to an electron and two other leptons (an electron and a positron).\n\nThe expected branching ratio for this process can be estimated using the GIM (Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani) mechanism, which suppresses the LFV processes in the Standard Model. The branching ratio for $\\mu^-\\rightarrow e^- e^+ e^-$ is given by:\n\n$BR(\\mu^-\\rightarrow e^- e^+ e^-) \\approx \\frac{\\alpha^5}{192\\pi^3} \\left(\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_W}\\right)^4 \\approx 10^{-54}$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $m_\\mu$ is the mass of the muon, and $m_W$ is the mass of the W boson.\n\nComparing this theoretical prediction with the current experimental limit of $1.0\\times 10^{-12}$, we can see that the Standard Model prediction is many orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental limit. This means that the process $\\mu^-\\rightarrow e^- e^+ e^-$ is extremely rare in the context of the Standard Model, and any observation of this process at a rate higher than the predicted branching ratio would be a strong indication of new physics beyond the Standard Model."
