    "message_2": "Experimental evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from various astrophysical and cosmological observations, which indicate the presence of an invisible mass that influences the behavior of visible matter in the universe. While the Standard Model of particle physics does not include dark matter particles, several theoretical models beyond the Standard Model have been proposed to explain the nature of dark matter. Here, we will discuss some of the key experimental evidence and compare them with the theoretical models.\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of stars and gas in galaxies show that they do not decrease with distance from the galactic center, as would be expected if only visible matter were present. This suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass (dark matter) that contributes to the gravitational force holding the galaxy together. Theoretical models like Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions have been proposed as candidates for dark matter particles that could explain these observations.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects (like galaxy clusters) can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations show that the mass distribution inferred from gravitational lensing is not accounted for by visible matter alone, providing further evidence for the existence of dark matter. Theoretical models like WIMPs and axions are consistent with these observations as well.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the composition and evolution of the universe. Precise measurements of the CMB by satellites like WMAP and Planck have confirmed that about 26% of the universe's energy content is in the form of dark matter. Theoretical models like WIMPs, axions, and sterile neutrinos are among the candidates that could explain the dark matter component in the CMB data.\n\n4. Large scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter are consistent with the observed large-scale structure of the universe. Theoretical models like WIMPs, axions, and sterile neutrinos can provide the necessary dark matter component for these simulations.\n\n5. Direct detection experiments: Several experiments, like XENON, LUX, and DarkSide, aim to directly detect dark matter particles through their interactions with ordinary matter. While no definitive signals have been observed so far, these experiments have set stringent limits on the properties of dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs.\n\n6. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for signals of dark matter annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Observations by instruments like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have provided some tantalizing hints, but no conclusive evidence for dark matter particles has been found yet.\n\nIn summary, while there is strong experimental evidence for the existence of dark matter from astrophysical and cosmological observations, direct and indirect detection experiments have not yet provided definitive evidence for specific dark matter particles. Theoretical models like WIMPs, axions, and sterile neutrinos remain viable candidates, and ongoing experiments continue to search for these elusive particles to help us understand the nature of dark matter beyond the Standard Model."
