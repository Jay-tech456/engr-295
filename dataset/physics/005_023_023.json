    "message_2": "The theory of special relativity does not directly deal with black holes or their event horizons. However, the Schwarzschild black hole is a solution to the equations of general relativity, which is an extension of special relativity to include gravity.\n\nThe circumference of the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is given by the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r_s\n\nwhere r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which is defined as:\n\nr_s = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe diameter of the event horizon is simply twice the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nD = 2 * r_s\n\nNow, to find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, we can divide the circumference by the diameter:\n\nRatio = C / D = (2 * π * r_s) / (2 * r_s)\n\nThe 2 * r_s terms cancel out, leaving:\n\nRatio = π\n\nSo, the ratio of the circumference of the event horizon to the diameter of a Schwarzschild black hole is π, or approximately 3.14159. This is the same ratio as for any circle, as the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is a perfect sphere."
