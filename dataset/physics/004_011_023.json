Calculate the event horizon and the singularity radius for a Reissner-Nordström black hole with a certain charge and mass. Also, investigate the electric and magnetic fields within and outside of the event horizon.",
    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric is a solution to Einstein's field equations in general relativity that describes the spacetime geometry around a charged, non-rotating black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere:\n- ds² is the spacetime interval\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- Q is the charge of the black hole\n- r, θ, and φ are the standard spherical coordinates\n- t is the time coordinate\n- G (Newton's gravitational constant) and c (speed of light) are set to 1 for simplicity\n\nThe event horizon and the singularity radius can be found by solving the equation:\n\n1 - 2M/r + Q²/r² = 0\n\nLet's denote the event horizon radius as r_h and the singularity radius as r_s. Solving for r_h and r_s, we get:\n\nr_h = M + sqrt(M² - Q²)\nr_s = M - sqrt(M² - Q²)\n\nNote that if Q² > M², there is no event horizon, and the object is called a naked singularity. If Q² = M², the black hole is called an extremal black hole, and the event horizon and singularity radius coincide.\n\nNow, let's investigate the electric and magnetic fields within and outside the event horizon. The electric field E and magnetic field B can be derived from the electromagnetic tensor F, which is given by:\n\nF = Q * (1/r²) * (dt ∧ dr)\n\nThe electric field E can be obtained from the radial component of F:\n\nE = Q / r²\n\nThe magnetic field B is zero because the black hole is non-rotating and spherically symmetric.\n\nIn summary, the Reissner-Nordström metric describes the spacetime geometry around a charged, non-rotating black hole. The event horizon and singularity radius can be calculated using the mass and charge of the black hole. The electric field is non-zero and depends on the charge and radial distance, while the magnetic field is zero due to the black hole's symmetry."
