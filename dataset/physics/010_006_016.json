    "message_1": "A metal ball of volume 100 cm^3 is completely submerged in water. If the weight of the ball is 800 N, what is the pressure exerted by the water on the ball? (Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2 and the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3)",
    "message_2": "To find the pressure exerted by the water on the metal ball, we first need to find the buoyant force acting on the ball. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the ball, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBuoyant force = Density of water × Volume of water displaced × Acceleration due to gravity\n\nThe volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the ball, which is 100 cm³. We need to convert this volume to m³:\n\n100 cm³ × (1 m/100 cm)³ = 100 × 10^(-6) m³ = 1 × 10^(-4) m³\n\nNow we can calculate the buoyant force:\n\nBuoyant force = (1000 kg/m³) × (1 × 10^(-4) m³) × (9.81 m/s²)\nBuoyant force = 0.981 N\n\nNow we can find the net force acting on the ball, which is the difference between the weight of the ball and the buoyant force:\n\nNet force = Weight of the ball - Buoyant force\nNet force = 800 N - 0.981 N\nNet force ≈ 799.019 N\n\nThe pressure exerted by the water on the ball can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPressure = Force / Area\n\nHowever, we do not have the area of the ball. Since the problem only asks for the pressure exerted by the water on the ball, we can assume that the pressure is uniformly distributed over the surface of the ball. In this case, the pressure exerted by the water on the ball is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at the depth where the ball is submerged.\n\nTo find the hydrostatic pressure, we can use the formula:\n\nHydrostatic pressure = Density of water × Acceleration due to gravity × Depth\n\nWe can find the depth by equating the net force acting on the ball to the hydrostatic pressure multiplied by the area of the ball:\n\nNet force = Hydrostatic pressure × Area\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the hydrostatic pressure:\n\nHydrostatic pressure = Net force / Area\n\nSince we do not have the area, we cannot find the exact value of the hydrostatic pressure. However, we can conclude that the pressure exerted by the water on the ball is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at the depth where the ball is submerged."
