    "message_2": "The mechanism behind the formation of Cooper pairs is based on the attractive interaction between electrons in a superconductor. This attractive interaction is mediated by lattice vibrations, also known as phonons. The concept of Cooper pairs was first proposed by Leon Cooper in 1956, and it is a key component of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity, which was developed in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer.\n\nIn a normal conductor, electrons move independently and scatter off impurities and lattice vibrations, leading to electrical resistance. However, in a superconductor, electrons form pairs called Cooper pairs. These pairs are formed when an electron moving through the lattice causes a slight distortion in the lattice, creating an attractive potential well that attracts another electron. The two electrons then become correlated and form a Cooper pair, which can be described as a single quantum mechanical entity with integer spin.\n\nCooper pairs contribute to zero electrical resistance in superconductors through a phenomenon called the \"energy gap.\" The energy gap is the minimum energy required to break a Cooper pair into individual electrons. At low temperatures, the thermal energy available is not sufficient to break the Cooper pairs, and the electrons in the superconductor are all paired up.\n\nWhen an electric current is applied to a superconductor, the Cooper pairs move through the lattice without scattering, as they are in a coherent quantum state. This coherent movement of Cooper pairs results in the absence of electrical resistance. In other words, the Cooper pairs can flow through the superconductor without losing energy to the lattice vibrations or impurities, leading to the phenomenon of superconductivity.\n\nIt is important to note that this explanation is based on the BCS theory, which is applicable to conventional superconductors. There are other types of superconductors, such as high-temperature superconductors, where the exact mechanism behind the formation of Cooper pairs and superconductivity is still not fully understood."
