    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between a cold reservoir at 4°C and a hot reservoir at 30°C. It receives 400 J of heat from the cold reservoir and exhausts 300 J of heat to the hot reservoir. Determine the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat absorbed by the cold reservoir (Q_c) to the work input (W) required to operate the heat pump. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nWe are given that the heat pump receives 400 J of heat from the cold reservoir (Q_c = 400 J) and exhausts 300 J of heat to the hot reservoir (Q_h = 300 J). The work input (W) can be calculated using the energy conservation principle, which states that the total energy input (Q_c) is equal to the sum of the energy output (Q_h) and the work input (W):\n\nQ_c = Q_h + W\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n400 J = 300 J + W\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = 400 J - 300 J = 100 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the COP using the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W = 400 J / 100 J = 4\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is 4."
