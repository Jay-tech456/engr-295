    "message_2": "In this problem, we are dealing with two parallel metal plates carrying a current 'I' perpendicular to the plates. Since the plates are carrying current, they will produce a magnetic field. To find the magnetic field strength at a point of distance 'd' from the center between the plates, we can use Ampere's law.\n\nAmpere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor this problem, we can choose a rectangular Amperian loop with one side parallel to the plates and the other side perpendicular to the plates. The loop will have a length 'd' and a width 'w'. The magnetic field will be strongest along the side of the loop parallel to the plates, and we can assume it to be constant along that side.\n\nLet's consider the magnetic field strength along the side parallel to the plates to be B. The contribution of the magnetic field along the other three sides of the loop will be zero since the magnetic field is perpendicular to those sides. Therefore, the line integral of the magnetic field around the loop will be:\n\n∮B⋅dl = Bw\n\nNow, we need to find the total current enclosed by the loop. Since the current is uniformly distributed across the plates, the current enclosed by the loop will be proportional to the width 'w' of the loop. The proportionality constant is I/w, so the enclosed current is:\n\nI_enclosed = (I/w)w = I\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's law:\n\nBw = μ₀I\n\nSolving for the magnetic field strength B:\n\nB = μ₀I/w\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point of distance 'd' from the center between the two parallel metal plates is:\n\nB = μ₀I/w"
