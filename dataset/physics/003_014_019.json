    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire with length 8 cm and width 5 cm carries a current of 2 A. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a rectangular loop, we can divide the loop into four segments, one for each side of the rectangle. We will calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the four segments as follows:\n1. Top segment (length 8 cm, parallel to the x-axis)\n2. Right segment (length 5 cm, parallel to the y-axis)\n3. Bottom segment (length 8 cm, parallel to the x-axis)\n4. Left segment (length 5 cm, parallel to the y-axis)\n\nThe magnetic field contributions from the top and bottom segments will cancel each other out due to symmetry, as will the contributions from the left and right segments. Therefore, we only need to calculate the magnetic field due to one of the vertical segments (either left or right) and then multiply by 2 to account for both segments.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field due to the right segment at the center of the loop. The current is flowing upward in this segment. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the segment:\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / r³\n\nThe position vector r for the right segment is given by:\n\nr = (4, y, 0) - (8, y, 0) = (-4, 0, 0)\n\nThe differential length vector dl is given by:\n\ndl = (0, dy, 0)\n\nThe cross product dl x r is given by:\n\ndl x r = (0, 0, -4dy)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate along the length of the right segment (from y = 0 to y = 5 cm):\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(2 * (0, 0, -4dy)) / ((-4)² + y²)^(3/2) dy, from y = 0 to y = 5\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(-8dy) / (16 + y²)^(3/2) dy, from y = 0 to y = 5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet u = y² + 16\ndu = 2y dy\ndy = du / (2y)\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(-8du) / (2y * u^(3/2)), from u = 16 to u = 41\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * (-4) * ∫(du) / u^(3/2), from u = 16 to u = 41\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * (-4) * (-2) * (u^(-1/2)) | from u = 16 to u = 41\n\nB_right = (μ₀ / 4π) * 8 * (sqrt(41) - sqrt(16))\n\nB_right = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 8 * (sqrt(41) - 4)\n\nB_right ≈ 1.60 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the left segment is equal in magnitude and in the same direction (out of the plane), the total magnetic field at the center of the loop is:\n\nB_total = 2 * B_right ≈ 3.20 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is out of the plane (in the positive z-direction).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 3.20 × 10⁻⁶ T, and the direction is out of the plane (positive z-direction)."
