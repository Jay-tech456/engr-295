    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy and momentum of the particle, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relativistic mass (m') of the particle using the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the particle. Plugging in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\nγ ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm' = γ * m\nm' ≈ 1.6667 * 1 GeV/c²\nm' ≈ 1.6667 GeV/c²\n\nNext, we can find the momentum (p) using the relativistic mass and velocity:\n\np = m' * v\np ≈ 1.6667 GeV/c² * 0.8c\np ≈ 1.3333 GeV/c\n\nNow, we can use the energy-momentum relation to find the total energy (E):\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\nE² = (1 GeV)² + (1.3333 GeV)²\nE² ≈ 2.7778 GeV²\n\nTaking the square root:\n\nE ≈ 1.6667 GeV\n\nSo, the total energy of the particle is approximately 1.6667 GeV, and its momentum is approximately 1.3333 GeV/c."
