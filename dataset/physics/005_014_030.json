    "message_2": "Let's call the two fragments A and B. Fragment A has a velocity of 0.8c. We want to find the velocity of fragment B.\n\nSince the decay is in the rest frame of the parent particle, the total momentum before and after the decay must be conserved. Before the decay, the total momentum is zero because the parent particle is at rest. After the decay, the total momentum is the sum of the momenta of fragments A and B.\n\nLet's denote the mass of fragment A as m_A and the mass of fragment B as m_B. The relativistic momentum of a particle is given by the formula:\n\np = (m * v) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nFor fragment A, the momentum is:\n\np_A = (m_A * 0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nFor fragment B, the momentum is:\n\np_B = (m_B * v_B) / sqrt(1 - v_B^2/c^2)\n\nSince the total momentum before and after the decay must be conserved, we have:\n\np_A + p_B = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for p_A and p_B, we get:\n\n(m_A * 0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) + (m_B * v_B) / sqrt(1 - v_B^2/c^2) = 0\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot solve this equation directly for v_B without more information about the masses of the fragments (m_A and m_B). However, if we know the masses of the fragments, we can use the above equation to find the velocity of fragment B."
