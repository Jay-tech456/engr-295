    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from a straight conductor carrying a current of 2 A, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the distance from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, since the conductor is straight and has a finite length, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the conductor. The formula for the magnetic field strength B around a straight conductor is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the conductor.\n\nGiven the current I = 2 A and the distance r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can calculate the magnetic field strength B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the straight conductor carrying a current of 2 A is 8 × 10^(-6) T or 8 µT."
