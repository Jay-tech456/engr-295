    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, 5 solar masses would be:\n\n5 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 9.945 × 10^30 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (1.327 × 10^20 m^3 s^-2) / (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nr_s ≈ 14,744,444.44 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14.74 million meters or 14.74 kilometers."
