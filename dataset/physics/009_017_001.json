    "message_2": "To determine the angle of the first-order minimum in the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere:\nθ is the angle of the minimum\nm is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first-order minimum)\nλ is the wavelength of the light (633 nm)\na is the width of the slit (0.5 mm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. Let's convert the slit width to meters:\n\n0.5 mm = 0.5 * 10^(-3) m = 5 * 10^(-4) m\n\nNow, let's convert the wavelength to meters:\n\n633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (5 * 10^(-4))\n\nsin(θ) = 1.266 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(1.266 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 1.266 * 10^(-6) radians (since the angle is very small)\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the following conversion:\n\nθ (degrees) = θ (radians) * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 1.266 * 10^(-6) * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 7.26 * 10^(-5) degrees\n\nSo, the angle of the first-order minimum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 7.26 * 10^(-5) degrees."
