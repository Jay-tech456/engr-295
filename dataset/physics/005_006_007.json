    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to calculate the amount of redshift experienced by a photon emitted from the surface of a massive object with a gravitational potential difference of 10^4 volts when it reaches an observer at infinity. The mass of the object is 10^30 kg and the radius is 10 km. The speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = ΔΦ/c^2\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔΦ is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the gravitational potential difference (ΔΦ) as 10^4 volts, and the speed of light (c) as 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔλ/λ = (10^4 V) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nΔλ/λ = (10^4 V) / (9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 1.11 x 10^-13\n\nThis is the fractional change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift. To find the actual change in wavelength (Δλ), we would need to know the initial wavelength (λ) of the photon. However, since the problem only asks for the amount of redshift experienced, we can report the fractional change in wavelength as the answer:\n\nΔλ/λ ≈ 1.11 x 10^-13"
