    "message_2": "A single event upset (SEU) in a microelectronic device occurs when a high-energy particle, such as a cosmic ray, strikes the device and causes a change in its state, leading to a transient or permanent error. The maximum energy of cosmic rays that can cause an SEU depends on the specific device and its sensitivity to radiation.\n\nCosmic rays consist of high-energy protons, atomic nuclei, and other particles, with energies ranging from millions of electron volts (MeV) to over 10^20 electron volts (eV). The energy required to cause an SEU in a microelectronic device typically falls in the range of a few MeV to a few hundred MeV. However, the exact energy threshold for an SEU depends on factors such as the device's technology, design, and materials.\n\nTo protect microelectronic devices against SEUs caused by cosmic rays, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Radiation-hardened design: Designing devices with radiation-tolerant materials and structures can help reduce their sensitivity to cosmic rays. For example, using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology can help isolate sensitive components from radiation-induced charge collection.\n\n2. Error detection and correction: Implementing error detection and correction (EDAC) techniques, such as parity checks and Hamming codes, can help identify and correct errors caused by SEUs.\n\n3. Redundancy: Using redundant components or systems can help ensure that a device continues to function correctly even if an SEU occurs. For example, triple modular redundancy (TMR) involves using three identical components to perform the same function, with a majority vote determining the correct output.\n\n4. Shielding: Encasing sensitive components in shielding materials, such as aluminum or lead, can help reduce the number of cosmic rays that reach the device. However, this approach can be limited by factors such as weight and cost, especially in applications like space missions.\n\n5. Active mitigation: Actively monitoring the device's environment for radiation and adjusting its operation accordingly can help minimize the risk of SEUs. For example, a device could be programmed to enter a low-power mode or temporarily halt its operation during periods of high radiation.\n\nIn summary, the maximum energy of cosmic rays that can cause an SEU in a microelectronic device depends on the specific device and its sensitivity to radiation. Protecting against such effects involves a combination of radiation-hardened design, error detection and correction, redundancy, shielding, and active mitigation strategies."
