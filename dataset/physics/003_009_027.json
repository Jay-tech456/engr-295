    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law and Ampere's law. First, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: r < R (inside the sphere)\nFor this case, we can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field. We choose a circular Amperian loop of radius r inside the sphere. The magnetic field is tangential to the loop, and the current enclosed by the loop is proportional to the area of the loop.\n\nThe area of the loop is A_loop = πr^2, and the total area of the sphere is A_sphere = 4πR^2. The ratio of the areas is:\n\nA_loop / A_sphere = (πr^2) / (4πR^2)\n\nSince the current I is uniformly distributed over the sphere, the current enclosed by the loop is:\n\nI_enclosed = I * (A_loop / A_sphere) = I * (πr^2) / (4πR^2)\n\nNow, applying Ampere's law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * (πr^2)) / (4πR^2 * 2πr) = (μ₀ * I * r) / (8πR^2)\n\nSo, for r < R:\n\nB_inside = (μ₀ * I * r) / (8πR^2)\n\nCase 2: r ≥ R (outside the sphere)\nFor this case, we can treat the sphere as a point with a total current I at its center. Using the Biot-Savart law for a point current source, the magnetic field at a distance r from the center is:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * I) / (4πr^2)\n\nSo, for r ≥ R:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * I) / (4πr^2)\n\nIn summary, the magnetic field at a distance r from the center of a sphere of radius R carrying a uniform current I is:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ * I * r) / (8πR^2) for r < R\nB(r) = (μ₀ * I) / (4πr^2) for r ≥ R"
