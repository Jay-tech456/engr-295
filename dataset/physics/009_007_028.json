    "message_1": "Here's a specific question for a physics student to solve related to the subtopic of Focal Length in Optics:\n\nSuppose you have a convex lens with a focal length of 10 cm. If an object is placed 20 cm away from the lens, at what distance from the lens will the object's image form? Use the thin lens equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, do is the distance of the object from the lens, and di is the distance of the image from the lens.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (do) is 20 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n2/20 = 1/20 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 1/20 from both sides:\n\n1/di = 2/20 - 1/20\n\n1/di = 1/20\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find di:\n\ndi = 20 cm\n\nSo, the object's image will form 20 cm away from the lens."
