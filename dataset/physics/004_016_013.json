    "message_2": "The presence of dark energy significantly affects the expansion rate of the universe according to the current understanding of General Relativity. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and has a negative pressure, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.\n\nIn the framework of General Relativity, the expansion rate of the universe is described by the Friedmann equations, which relate the scale factor (a measure of the size of the universe) to the energy content of the universe, including dark energy. Dark energy is typically modeled as a cosmological constant (denoted by Î›) or as a slowly varying field called quintessence.\n\nWhen dark energy is included in the Friedmann equations, it contributes a term proportional to the cosmological constant or the energy density of the quintessence field. This term has a repulsive effect, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time. This acceleration was first observed in the late 1990s through measurements of distant supernovae and has since been confirmed by other observations, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale distribution of galaxies.\n\nThe exact nature of dark energy and its role in the expansion of the universe is still an open question in modern cosmology. However, it is clear that the presence of dark energy has a significant impact on the expansion rate of the universe, leading to the currently observed accelerated expansion."
