    "message_2": "The mechanism behind the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova shock waves is called diffusive shock acceleration or Fermi acceleration. This process is named after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who first proposed the idea in 1949.\n\nWhen a massive star explodes in a supernova, it releases an enormous amount of energy, creating a shock wave that propagates through the surrounding interstellar medium. This shock wave compresses and heats the gas, creating a region of high pressure and temperature behind the shock front.\n\nCosmic rays, which are high-energy charged particles (mostly protons and atomic nuclei), can be accelerated in this environment. The acceleration process involves the interaction of cosmic rays with the magnetic field in the shock wave region.\n\nAs cosmic rays encounter the shock wave, they scatter off magnetic field irregularities and can gain energy through multiple interactions. When a cosmic ray particle crosses the shock front, it experiences a velocity difference between the upstream (pre-shock) and downstream (post-shock) regions. This velocity difference can cause the particle to gain energy.\n\nThe process is diffusive because the cosmic rays undergo many small energy gains through multiple scatterings, rather than a single large energy gain. This leads to a power-law distribution of particle energies, which is a characteristic feature of cosmic ray spectra.\n\nOver time, the cosmic rays can gain significant amounts of energy through this process, eventually reaching extremely high energies. These high-energy cosmic rays can then propagate through the galaxy, interacting with other matter and magnetic fields, and eventually reaching Earth, where they can be detected by cosmic ray observatories.\n\nIn summary, the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova shock waves is primarily due to the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which involves multiple scatterings of cosmic rays off magnetic field irregularities in the shock wave region, leading to a gradual increase in their energy."
