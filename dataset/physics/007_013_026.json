    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released during the fusion of two helium nuclei to form a beryllium nucleus, we can use the mass-energy equivalence principle and the concept of binding energy.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in mass between the initial helium nuclei and the final beryllium nucleus. The mass of a helium nucleus (4He) is approximately 4.001506 amu (atomic mass units), and the mass of a beryllium nucleus (8Be) is approximately 8.005305 amu.\n\nInitial mass (2 helium nuclei) = 2 * 4.001506 amu = 8.003012 amu\nFinal mass (beryllium nucleus) = 8.005305 amu\n\nMass difference = Initial mass - Final mass = 8.003012 amu - 8.005305 amu = -0.002293 amu\n\nNow, we can convert this mass difference to energy using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass difference, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass difference from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). 1 amu is approximately 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass difference in kg = -0.002293 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = -3.807 x 10^-30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\n\nE = mc^2 = (-3.807 x 10^-30 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = -1.02 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nThe negative sign indicates that energy is released during the fusion process. Therefore, the total energy released during the fusion of two helium nuclei to form a beryllium nucleus in a star is approximately 1.02 x 10^-12 Joules."
