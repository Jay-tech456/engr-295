    "message_2": "The evidence for the existence of dark matter particles comes from various astronomical and cosmological observations that suggest the presence of unseen mass in the universe. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation of galaxies show that stars and gas at the outer edges of galaxies move at velocities that are much higher than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxies. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant objects due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects indicate that there is more mass present in galaxy clusters than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe. Detailed measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations provide information about the composition of the universe. These measurements indicate that about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content is in the form of dark matter, while only about 5% is in the form of ordinary matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, based on the observed amounts of dark and ordinary matter, match the observed structures quite well.\n\nThe physical properties of dark matter particles that make them difficult to detect are:\n\n1. Non-luminous: Dark matter particles do not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making them invisible to telescopes that detect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\n\n2. Weakly interacting: Dark matter particles are thought to interact only through gravity and possibly through the weak nuclear force. This means they do not interact strongly with ordinary matter or radiation, making them difficult to detect through conventional particle detectors.\n\n3. Massive: Dark matter particles are believed to be massive, which is necessary for them to provide the gravitational influence observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, their exact mass and other properties are still unknown.\n\nSeveral experiments are currently underway to directly detect dark matter particles, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, and various underground detectors like the XENON, LUX, and SuperCDMS experiments. These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles through their weak interactions with ordinary matter or by looking for signatures of dark matter annihilation or decay. So far, no direct detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed, but the search continues, and new experimental techniques are being developed to improve the sensitivity of these searches."
