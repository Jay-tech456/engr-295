    "message_1": "A spaceship traveling at 0.8c relative to Earth sends out a signal every 12 hours according to its onboard clock. What is the time between signals as observed by an Earth observer? Use the Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula, which is derived from the Lorentz transformation. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time interval in the spaceship's frame (12 hours), Δt' is the time interval in Earth's frame, v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and Earth (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor, which is the denominator of the time dilation formula:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNow, we can find the square root of this value:\n\nsqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNext, we can plug this value back into the time dilation formula to find the time interval as observed by an Earth observer:\n\nΔt' = Δt / 0.6 = 12 hours / 0.6 = 20 hours\n\nSo, the time between signals as observed by an Earth observer is 20 hours."
