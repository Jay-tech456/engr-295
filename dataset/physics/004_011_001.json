Additionally, how does the behavior of test particles near the event horizon of a charged black hole differ from that of an uncharged black hole?",
    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric describes a charged, non-rotating (spherically symmetric) black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is its charge, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates. The electric potential Φ of the charged black hole can be found by solving the Maxwell's equations in the curved spacetime described by the Reissner-Nordström metric. The electric potential is given by:\n\nΦ(r) = Q / r\n\nThis formula shows that the electric potential is directly proportional to the charge Q and inversely proportional to the radial distance r from the black hole.\n\nNow, let's discuss the behavior of test particles near the event horizon of a charged black hole compared to an uncharged black hole.\n\nFor an uncharged black hole (Schwarzschild black hole), the event horizon is located at r = 2M. Test particles near the event horizon experience a strong gravitational attraction towards the black hole, and if they cross the event horizon, they cannot escape.\n\nFor a charged black hole (Reissner-Nordström black hole), there are two horizons: the outer event horizon (r+) and the inner Cauchy horizon (r-), given by:\n\nr± = M ± √(M² - Q²)\n\nThe behavior of test particles near the event horizon of a charged black hole depends on the charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M). If Q/M is small, the electric repulsion is negligible compared to the gravitational attraction, and the test particles behave similarly to those near an uncharged black hole. However, if Q/M is large, the electric repulsion becomes significant, and test particles with the same charge as the black hole will experience a repulsive force that can counteract the gravitational attraction. In the extreme case where Q² = M², the two horizons merge, and the black hole becomes an extremal black hole with a naked singularity.\n\nIn summary, the electric potential of a charged black hole as described by the Reissner-Nordström metric is given by Φ(r) = Q / r. The behavior of test particles near the event horizon of a charged black hole differs from that of an uncharged black hole, with the electric repulsion playing a significant role when the charge-to-mass ratio is large."
