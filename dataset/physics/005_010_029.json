    "message_2": "To calculate the angle at which the light is observed by someone on Earth due to the relativistic aberration of light, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration:\n\nθ' = arctan[(sin(θ) / (γ(1 + βcos(θ))]\n\nwhere:\nθ' is the angle of the light as observed by someone on Earth\nθ is the angle of the light in the spaceship's frame (in this case, it's 180 degrees since the light is emitted from the front to the back)\nβ is the spaceship's velocity relative to the speed of light (0.6c in this case)\nγ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nβ = 0.6\nβ^2 = 0.6^2 = 0.36\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the relativistic aberration formula:\n\nθ = 180 degrees = π radians\ncos(θ) = cos(π) = -1\nsin(θ) = sin(π) = 0\n\nθ' = arctan[(0) / (1.25(1 + 0.6(-1)))] = arctan(0)\n\nSince arctan(0) = 0, the angle at which the light is observed by someone on Earth due to the relativistic aberration of light is 0 degrees. This means that the light appears to be moving directly from the front to the back of the spaceship, as seen by an observer on Earth."
