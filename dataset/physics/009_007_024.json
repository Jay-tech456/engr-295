    "message_1": "A converging lens has a focal length of 10 cm. If an object is placed 15 cm in front of the lens, at what distance from the lens will the image be formed?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance at which the image will be formed, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 10 cm, u = 15 cm\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/15 + 1/v\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/15\n1/v = (15 - 10) / (10 * 15)\n1/v = 5 / 150\n1/v = 1/30\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find v:\n\nv = 30 cm\n\nSo, the image will be formed at a distance of 30 cm from the lens."
