    "message_2": "The current evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter primarily comes from astrophysical and cosmological observations. Some of the key observations include:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground, known as gravitational lensing, provides evidence for dark matter. The observed lensing effects are often stronger than what can be accounted for by the visible mass, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. The observed patterns in the CMB can be best explained by a model that includes dark matter, which affects the way matter clumps together and forms structures.\n\n4. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffold for the formation of these structures.\n\nTheoretical models that explain the interaction between dark matter and normal matter are mainly based on the assumption that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). These particles are thought to interact with normal matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. Some of the popular theoretical models include:\n\n1. Supersymmetry (SUSY): SUSY is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that predicts the existence of partner particles for each known particle. In SUSY models, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is often stable and neutral, making it a suitable dark matter candidate.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are light, neutral, and weakly interacting, making them potential dark matter candidates.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrinos. They could be produced in the early universe and could serve as dark matter candidates.\n\nDespite these theoretical models, direct detection of dark matter particles has not been successful so far. Experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), direct detection experiments (e.g., XENON1T, LUX), and indirect detection experiments (e.g., Fermi-LAT, IceCube) continue to search for evidence of dark matter interactions with normal matter."
