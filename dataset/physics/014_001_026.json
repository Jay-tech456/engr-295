    "message_2": "Experimental evidence for dark matter and dark energy comes from various observations in astrophysics and cosmology. Here are some key pieces of evidence and current methods used to study these phenomena:\n\n1. Galactic rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars in spiral galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass distribution. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat at large distances from the galactic center, suggesting the presence of an unseen mass, or dark matter, that provides additional gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies due to the gravitational influence of massive objects in the foreground is called gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects indicate that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter, providing further evidence for dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal information about the composition of the universe, including the presence of dark matter and dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter and dark energy. Observations of this large-scale structure provide constraints on the properties of these mysterious components.\n\n5. Supernovae observations: Type Ia supernovae are used as \"standard candles\" to measure cosmic distances. Observations of these supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which can be explained by the presence of dark energy.\n\nCurrent theories and methods to detect and understand dark matter and dark energy include:\n\n1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect dark matter particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), by observing their interactions with ordinary matter in highly sensitive detectors.\n\n2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for signs of dark matter annihilation or decay by looking for excess high-energy particles, such as gamma rays or neutrinos, coming from regions where dark matter is expected to be abundant, like the center of our galaxy.\n\n3. Collider experiments: Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can potentially produce dark matter particles in high-energy collisions, providing insights into their properties.\n\n4. Dark energy surveys: Large-scale surveys of the universe, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, aim to map the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters to better understand the properties of dark energy and its influence on the expansion of the universe.\n\n5. Theoretical models: Physicists are developing new theoretical models to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and modifications to general relativity. These models can be tested through observations and experiments, helping to refine our understanding of these elusive components of the universe."
