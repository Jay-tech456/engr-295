    "message_1": "What is the percentage change in wavelength of light emitted from the surface of a planet with a gravitational field strength of 2.6 × 10^-10 N/kg compared to the wavelength of the same light emitted from a point far away in space? Assume the planet's radius is negligible compared to the distance between the planet and the source of light. (Use the formula for gravitational redshift effect to solve)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift effect, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = GM/c²R\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 N m²/kg²), M is the mass of the planet, c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance from the center of the planet to the point where the light is emitted.\n\nWe are given the gravitational field strength (g) at the surface of the planet, which is 2.6 × 10^-10 N/kg. The formula for gravitational field strength is:\n\ng = GM/R²\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the mass of the planet:\n\nM = gR²/G\n\nHowever, we don't have the value of R (the distance from the center of the planet to the point where the light is emitted). Since the problem states that the planet's radius is negligible compared to the distance between the planet and the source of light, we can assume that R is approximately equal to the distance between the planet and the source of light.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula for the percentage change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ/λ = (gR²/G) / (c²R)\nΔλ/λ = gR / (c²G)\n\nSince we don't have the value of R, we cannot find the exact percentage change in wavelength. However, we can express the percentage change in terms of R:\n\nΔλ/λ = (2.6 × 10^-10 N/kg × R) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)² × (6.674 × 10^-11 N m²/kg²)\n\nΔλ/λ = (2.6 × 10^-10 × R) / (9 × 10^16 × 6.674 × 10^-11)\n\nΔλ/λ = (2.6 × 10^-10 × R) / (6.006 × 10^6)\n\nTo find the percentage change, we can multiply the result by 100:\n\nPercentage change = [(2.6 × 10^-10 × R) / (6.006 × 10^6)] × 100\n\nWithout the value of R, we cannot find the exact percentage change in wavelength. However, this formula can be used to calculate the percentage change once the distance between the planet and the source of light (R) is known."
