    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a heavy lepton with a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV/c². It has a very short lifetime of about 2.9 x 10⁻¹³ seconds and can decay into various final states. The decay channels and branching fractions for the tau lepton when it decays into two charged hadrons, a charged lepton and a neutral lepton, and three charged hadrons are as follows:\n\n1. Decay into two charged hadrons:\n\nThe main decay channel for two charged hadrons is τ → π⁻π⁺π⁻ντ, where π⁻, π⁺, and π⁻ are pions and ντ is the tau neutrino. The branching fraction for this decay channel is approximately 9.3%.\n\n2. Decay into a charged lepton and a neutral lepton:\n\nThe main decay channel for a charged lepton and a neutral lepton is τ → ℓ⁻νℓντ, where ℓ⁻ is a charged lepton (either an electron or a muon) and νℓ is the corresponding neutrino. The branching fractions for these decay channels are:\n\n- τ → e⁻νeντ: approximately 17.8%\n- τ → μ⁻νμντ: approximately 17.4%\n\n3. Decay into three charged hadrons:\n\nThe main decay channel for three charged hadrons is τ → π⁻π⁺π⁻π⁰ντ, where π⁻, π⁺, π⁻ are pions, π⁰ is a neutral pion, and ντ is the tau neutrino. The branching fraction for this decay channel is approximately 1.0%.\n\nIt is important to note that these branching fractions are approximate values and can vary slightly depending on the source. Additionally, there are other less common decay channels for the tau lepton, but the ones mentioned above are the most relevant for the given final states."
