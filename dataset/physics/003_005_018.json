    "message_2": "We can use the Biot-Savart Law to calculate the magnetic field at a point due to a current-carrying wire. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a point P at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space.\n\nGiven:\nLength of the wire = 20 cm (not needed for this calculation)\nCurrent (I) = 5 A\nDistance (r) = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nPermeability of free space (μ₀) = 4π x 10^-7 T m/A\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 T m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe Amperes (A) cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 T m * 5) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (2π x 10^-7 T m * 5) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = (10π x 10^-7 T m) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 10π x 10^-6 T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the wire is approximately 3.14 x 10^-5 T (Tesla)."
