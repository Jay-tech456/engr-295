    "message_2": "The current best estimate for the mass of the top quark is approximately 172.76 GeV/c² (gigaelectronvolts divided by the speed of light squared). This value is obtained from a combination of measurements from various experiments, primarily from the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Fermilab Tevatron.\n\nThe top quark's mass has been determined using experimental data from proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions. In these high-energy collisions, top quarks are produced in pairs (top and anti-top quarks). The top quark is a very short-lived particle and decays almost immediately into other particles, such as a bottom quark and a W boson. The W boson can further decay into a lepton and a neutrino or a pair of quarks. By analyzing the decay products and their kinematic properties, physicists can reconstruct the mass of the top quark.\n\nSeveral techniques are used to measure the top quark mass, including template methods, matrix element methods, and the ideogram method. These techniques involve comparing the observed data with simulated data for various top quark masses and finding the mass value that provides the best agreement between the two.\n\nThe most precise measurements of the top quark mass come from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC and the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron. By combining the results from these experiments, the Particle Data Group (PDG) provides the current best estimate of the top quark mass, which is 172.76 ± 0.30(stat) ± 0.91(syst) GeV/c²."
