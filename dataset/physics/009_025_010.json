    "message_2": "To calculate the numerical aperture (NA) of an optical fiber, we can use the following formula:\n\nNA = √(n1² - n2²)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the core (1.5 in this case) and n2 is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (1.0 for air).\n\nNA = √((1.5)² - (1.0)²)\nNA = √(2.25 - 1)\nNA = √1.25\nNA ≈ 1.118\n\nSo, the numerical aperture of the optical fiber is approximately 1.118.\n\nNow, to determine the maximum angle of incidence (θ_max), we can use the following formula:\n\nsin(θ_max) = NA\n\nθ_max = arcsin(NA)\nθ_max = arcsin(1.118)\n\nHowever, the value of sin(θ) must be between -1 and 1, and since our calculated NA is greater than 1, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given values. Please check the refractive indices and other parameters again."
