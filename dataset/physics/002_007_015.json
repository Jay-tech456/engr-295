    "message_1": "What is the heat capacity of a copper rod of length 50 cm and cross-sectional area 2 cm², if it requires 120 J of energy to increase its temperature from 25°C to 75°C? (Assuming copper has a specific heat capacity of 0.385 J/g°C)",
    "message_2": "To find the heat capacity of the copper rod, we first need to determine its mass. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nmass = volume × density\n\nwhere volume = length × cross-sectional area, and the density of copper is approximately 8.96 g/cm³.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the copper rod:\n\nvolume = length × cross-sectional area\nvolume = 50 cm × 2 cm²\nvolume = 100 cm³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the copper rod:\n\nmass = volume × density\nmass = 100 cm³ × 8.96 g/cm³\nmass = 896 g\n\nNow that we have the mass of the copper rod, we can use the formula for heat capacity:\n\nheat capacity = mass × specific heat capacity\n\nwhere specific heat capacity of copper is 0.385 J/g°C.\n\nheat capacity = 896 g × 0.385 J/g°C\nheat capacity = 344.96 J/°C\n\nNow, we can use the formula for heat transfer:\n\nQ = heat capacity × ΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer (120 J in this case) and ΔT is the change in temperature (75°C - 25°C = 50°C).\n\n120 J = 344.96 J/°C × ΔT\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔT:\n\nΔT = 120 J / 344.96 J/°C\nΔT ≈ 0.347 °C\n\nSince the temperature change is much smaller than expected (50°C), there might be an error in the problem statement or the specific heat capacity value provided. However, based on the given information, the heat capacity of the copper rod is approximately 344.96 J/°C."
