    "message_2": "(a) To rewrite the van der Pol equation as a system of two first-order differential equations, we introduce a new variable y(t) = x'(t). We can then write the given equation as:\n\nx''(t) + (x(t)^2 - 1)*y(t) + x(t) = 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as two first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = y(t) (1)\ndy/dt = -x(t) - (x(t)^2 - 1)*y(t) (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two first-order differential equations.\n\n(b) To solve the van der Pol equation for the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 1, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method. Here's a Python code using the scipy library to solve the system and plot the time evolution of x(t) for t in [0, 10]:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef van_der_pol(t, state):\n    x, y = state\n    dxdt = y\n    dydt = -x - (x**2 - 1)*y\n    return [dxdt, dydt]\n\nt_span = [0, 10]\ninitial_conditions = [0, 1]\nt_eval = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)\n\nsolution = solve_ivp(van_der_pol, t_span, initial_conditions, t_eval=t_eval)\n\nplt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[0])\nplt.xlabel('t')\nplt.ylabel('x(t)')\nplt.title('Time evolution of x(t) for the van der Pol oscillator')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n(c) To investigate the chaotic behavior of the van der Pol oscillator by varying the value of the parameter μ, we can modify the van_der_pol function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef van_der_pol_mu(t, state, mu):\n    x, y = state\n    dxdt = y\n    dydt = -x - mu*(x**2 - 1)*y\n    return [dxdt, dydt]\n```\n\nNow, we can solve the system for different values of μ and observe the change in behavior as μ is increased from 0 to 4:\n\n```python\nmu_values = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)\n\nfor mu in mu_values:\n    solution = solve_ivp(van_der_pol_mu, t_span, initial_conditions, t_eval=t_eval, args=(mu,))\n    plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[0], label=f\"μ={mu}\")\n\nplt.xlabel('t')\nplt.ylabel('x(t)')\nplt.title('Time evolution of x(t) for the van der Pol oscillator with varying μ')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAs μ is increased from 0 to 4, the behavior of the van der Pol oscillator changes. For μ = 0, the system behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator with constant amplitude. As μ increases, the system exhibits more complex behavior, with the amplitude of oscillations increasing and the oscillations becoming more irregular. This is an indication of the onset of chaotic behavior in the system."
