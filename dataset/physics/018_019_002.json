    "message_2": "The cross-section for top quark pair production at the LHC depends on the center-of-mass energy, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding protons, and the strong coupling constant (αs). To calculate the cross-section, we typically rely on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, which are performed at different orders of accuracy (leading order, next-to-leading order, etc.).\n\nFor a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the most recent and accurate calculations are performed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. According to these calculations, the cross-section for top quark pair production at the LHC is approximately 832 pb (picobarns).\n\nIt is important to note that this value has some uncertainties, mainly due to the PDFs and the value of αs. These uncertainties are typically at the level of a few percent.\n\nReference: Czakon, M., Fiedler, P., & Heymes, D. (2017).
