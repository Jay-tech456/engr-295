    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of a nickel nanowire, we can use the following formula:\n\nThermal conductivity (k) = (Cross-sectional area * Length * Phonon mean free path * Specific heat * Phonon group velocity) / (3 * Volume)\n\nHowever, for nanowires, the phonon mean free path is limited by the diameter of the nanowire. In this case, the diameter is 50 nm, which is smaller than the bulk phonon mean free path for nickel (around 300 nm). Therefore, we need to consider the size effect on thermal conductivity.\n\nFor nickel, the bulk thermal conductivity (k_bulk) at room temperature (300 K) is approximately 90 W/m·K. To account for the size effect, we can use the following formula:\n\nk_nanowire = k_bulk * (d / (d + 2 * L))\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the nanowire (50 nm) and L is the phonon mean free path (300 nm).\n\nk_nanowire = 90 W/m·K * (50 nm / (50 nm + 2 * 300 nm))\nk_nanowire = 90 W/m·K * (50 nm / 650 nm)\nk_nanowire ≈ 6.92 W/m·K\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the nickel nanowire with a diameter of 50 nm and a length of 100 μm at room temperature (300 K) is approximately 6.92 W/m·K."
