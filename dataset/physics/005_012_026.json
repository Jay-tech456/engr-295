    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton, we can use the following equation:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.97c).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.97c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.97^2)\nγ ≈ 4.108\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the proton (m). The mass of a proton is approximately 1.6726 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (4.108 - 1)(1.6726 × 10^-27 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 3.108 × (1.6726 × 10^-27 kg)(9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 4.663 × 10^-10 J\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 4.663 × 10^-10 joules."
