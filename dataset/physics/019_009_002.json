    "message_2": "In the phi-four theory, the beta function describes the running of the coupling constant with respect to the energy scale. The beta function at one-loop order and two-loop order are given by the following expressions:\n\nAt one-loop order, the beta function β(g) is given by:\n\nβ(g) = (μ ∂g/∂μ)_1 = (3/2) (N+2) (g^2)/(16π^2)\n\nwhere μ is the renormalization scale, N is the number of scalar fields, and g is the coupling constant.\n\nAt two-loop order, the beta function β(g) is given by:\n\nβ(g) = (μ ∂g/∂μ)_2 = (3/2) (N+2) (g^2)/(16π^2) - (3/8) (N+2)^2 (g^3)/(16π^2)^2\n\nThe first term in the two-loop beta function is the same as the one-loop beta function. The second term is the additional contribution at two-loop order, which is proportional to g^3. This term represents the higher-order quantum corrections to the running of the coupling constant.\n\nIn general, the two-loop beta function provides a more accurate description of the running of the coupling constant compared to the one-loop beta function, as it includes higher-order quantum corrections. However, the one-loop beta function is often used as a good approximation when the coupling constant is small, as the higher-order terms become less significant in this case."
