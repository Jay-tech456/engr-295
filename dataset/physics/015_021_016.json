    "message_2": "The gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk are primarily influenced by the mass and distance of the disk. The waveform of these gravitational waves can be affected by these factors in the following ways:\n\n1. Mass of the accretion disk: The mass of the accretion disk plays a crucial role in determining the strength and frequency of the gravitational waves. A more massive accretion disk will produce stronger gravitational waves with higher frequencies. This is because the increased mass leads to a greater amount of energy being emitted as gravitational waves, and the increased gravitational force causes the matter in the accretion disk to orbit the black hole at higher velocities. As a result, the waveform of the gravitational waves will have a higher amplitude and frequency when the mass of the accretion disk is larger.\n\n2. Distance of the accretion disk from the black hole: The distance of the accretion disk from the black hole also affects the waveform of the produced gravitational waves. As the distance between the accretion disk and the black hole increases, the strength of the gravitational waves decreases, and the frequency of the waves also decreases. This is because the gravitational force between the black hole and the accretion disk weakens with increasing distance, causing the matter in the disk to orbit at lower velocities. Consequently, the waveform of the gravitational waves will have a lower amplitude and frequency when the accretion disk is farther away from the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the waveform of the gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk is affected by the mass and distance of the disk. A more massive disk and a closer distance to the black hole result in stronger gravitational waves with higher frequencies, while a less massive disk and a greater distance from the black hole lead to weaker gravitational waves with lower frequencies."
