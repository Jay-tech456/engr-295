    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a star can have before it collapses under its own gravity and becomes a black hole is not a fixed value, but it is generally believed to be around 2 to 3 times the mass of our Sun. This limit is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, which is derived from the principles of General Relativity.\n\nThe TOV limit depends on the equation of state of the stellar material, which describes the relationship between pressure, density, and temperature inside the star. As the mass of the star increases, the pressure at its core also increases. When the mass reaches the TOV limit, the pressure is no longer sufficient to counteract the gravitational force, and the star collapses under its own gravity, eventually forming a black hole.\n\nIt is important to note that not all massive stars will become black holes. Some may undergo supernova explosions, shedding mass and leaving behind a neutron star or other compact object. The specific outcome depends on various factors, including the star's initial mass, composition, and evolutionary history."
