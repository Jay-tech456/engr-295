    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a black hole can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nThe mass of our Sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, a black hole with a mass equivalent to 10 times the mass of our Sun would have a mass of 1.989 x 10^31 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 x 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 x 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass equivalent to 10 times the mass of our Sun is approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nThe event horizon of a black hole is defined as the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, including light. The size of the event horizon is directly related to the Schwarzschild radius. In fact, the Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole. Therefore, the size of the event horizon for this black hole would also be approximately 29.5 kilometers."
