    "message_1": "A copper wire of length 2 meters and a cross-sectional area of 0.5 mm² is wrapped around a resistor that carries a current of 3 A. Calculate the strength of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the resistor. The resistivity of copper is 1.68 x 10^-8 Ω·m.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the strength of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the resistor, we can use Ampere's Law. The magnetic field (B) around a straight wire carrying a current (I) at a distance (r) from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A.\n\nIn this case, the current (I) is 3 A, and the distance (r) is 4 cm, which is equal to 0.04 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^-7 T·m/A * 3 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nB = (1.2 × 10^-6 T·m) / 0.08 m\n\nB ≈ 1.5 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the strength of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 cm from the center of the resistor is approximately 1.5 × 10^-5 T (Tesla)."
