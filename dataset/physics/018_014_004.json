    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that can be emitted as gravitational waves by a binary system of two black holes can be estimated using the concept of binding energy. In the final moments before the black holes merge, a significant fraction of the system's binding energy is released as gravitational waves. \n\nFor a binary system of two black holes with equal masses (50 solar masses each), the binding energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_bind = -G * (M1 * M2) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and R is the distance between them.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes and the distance between them into SI units. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM1 = M2 = 50 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nThe distance between the black holes is given as 100 kilometers, which is equal to 100,000 meters.\n\nNow we can calculate the binding energy:\n\nE_bind = - (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 × 10^30 kg)^2 / (2 * 100,000 m)\nE_bind ≈ - 2.208 × 10^47 J\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the energy is required to separate the black holes. However, we are interested in the energy released as gravitational waves, which is a fraction of the binding energy. It is estimated that up to 10% of the total mass of the system can be emitted as gravitational waves during the merger. Therefore, the maximum energy emitted as gravitational waves is:\n\nE_grav_waves = 0.1 * 100 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg * c^2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s):\n\nE_grav_waves ≈ 0.1 * 100 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg * (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE_grav_waves ≈ 1.78 × 10^47 J\n\nSo, the maximum amount of energy that can be emitted as gravitational waves by this binary system of two black holes is approximately 1.78 × 10^47 Joules."
