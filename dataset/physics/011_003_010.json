    "message_2": "In a 2D square lattice with a coordination number of 4, each atom is connected to four nearest neighbors. The dispersion relation of phonons in such a lattice can be determined using the dynamical matrix approach. For simplicity, we will consider a monatomic lattice with identical atoms of mass m and nearest-neighbor spring constant K.\n\nThe dispersion relation for a 2D square lattice can be written as:\n\nω²(k) = (2K/m) [2 - cos(k_x a) - cos(k_y a)]\n\nwhere ω(k) is the angular frequency of the phonon mode, k_x and k_y are the components of the wave vector k in the x and y directions, and a is the lattice constant.\n\nTo find the lowest and highest frequency branches, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the dispersion relation. The minimum value occurs when the cosine terms are at their maximum (cos(k_x a) = cos(k_y a) = 1):\n\nω_min² = (2K/m) [2 - 1 - 1] = 0\n\nω_min = 0\n\nThe corresponding wave vector for the lowest frequency branch is k_min = (0, 0).\n\nThe maximum value of the dispersion relation occurs when the cosine terms are at their minimum (cos(k_x a) = cos(k_y a) = -1):\n\nω_max² = (2K/m) [2 - (-1) - (-1)] = (8K/m)\n\nω_max = √(8K/m)\n\nThe corresponding wave vector for the highest frequency branch is k_max = (π/a, π/a).\n\nIn summary, the dispersion relation for phonons in a 2D square lattice with a coordination number of 4 is:\n\nω²(k) = (2K/m) [2 - cos(k_x a) - cos(k_y a)]\n\nThe lowest frequency branch has a frequency of ω_min = 0 and a wave vector of k_min = (0, 0). The highest frequency branch has a frequency of ω_max = √(8K/m) and a wave vector of k_max = (π/a, π/a)."
