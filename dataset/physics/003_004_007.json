    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 0.1 meters and the current I = 2 Amperes, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ (40 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ 200 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
