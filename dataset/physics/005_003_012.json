    "message_2": "To calculate the relative velocity of the second spaceship as observed by the Earth observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to the Earth observer (0.8c), v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = (0.8c + 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * 0.6c) / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48c^2 / c^2)\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nv = 1.4c / 1.48\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.946c\n\nSo, the speed of the second spaceship as observed by the Earth observer is approximately 0.946 times the speed of light."
