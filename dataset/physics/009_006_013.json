    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the focal length of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 20 cm by performing an experiment involving the formation of an inverted image of an object placed at a distance of 10 cm from the mirror. What is the focal length of the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance (10 cm in this case), and di is the image distance.\n\nWe also know that the radius of curvature (R) is related to the focal length by:\n\nf = R/2\n\nSince the radius of curvature is given as 20 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di):\n\n1/10 = 1/10 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can subtract 1/10 from both sides:\n\n1/di = 1/10 - 1/10\n\n1/di = 0\n\nThis result indicates that an inverted image cannot be formed at the given object distance of 10 cm, as the object is placed exactly at the focal point of the mirror. In this case, the image would be formed at infinity."
