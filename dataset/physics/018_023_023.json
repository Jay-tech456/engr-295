    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, $\\alpha_s$, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong nuclear force responsible for binding quarks and gluons together to form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. The strong coupling constant determines the strength of the interaction between quarks and gluons.\n\nThe value of $\\alpha_s$ depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom. At high energies (short distances), the strong force becomes weaker, and the value of $\\alpha_s$ decreases. Conversely, at low energies (large distances), the strong force becomes stronger, and the value of $\\alpha_s$ increases.\n\nTo determine the strong coupling constant using precision measurements of hadronic decays of the $\\tau$ lepton, high-energy physics experiments can be employed. The $\\tau$ lepton is a heavy lepton with a mass of approximately 1.78 GeV/cÂ², which decays into hadrons and neutrinos through the weak interaction. The hadronic decays of the $\\tau$ lepton are mediated by the strong force, and thus, they are sensitive to the value of $\\alpha_s$.\n\nThe experimental procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1. Measure the decay rates of the $\\tau$ lepton into various hadronic final states, such as $\\tau^- \\rightarrow \\pi^- \\pi^0 \\nu_\\tau$, $\\tau^- \\rightarrow \\pi^- \\pi^0 \\pi^0 \\nu_\\tau$, and others. These decay rates can be obtained from the differential cross-sections of the $\\tau$-pair production in electron-positron collisions.\n\n2. Calculate the theoretical predictions for these decay rates using perturbative QCD, which involves a series expansion in powers of $\\alpha_s$. The perturbative QCD calculations require the input of the strong coupling constant and other QCD parameters, such as quark masses and renormalization scale.\n\n3. Compare the experimental measurements of the decay rates with the theoretical predictions, and adjust the value of $\\alpha_s$ to minimize the difference between the two. This can be done using a global fit to the data, which takes into account the correlations between different decay channels and the uncertainties in the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.\n\n4. Extract the value of the strong coupling constant at the scale of the $\\tau$ mass, $\\alpha_s(m_\\tau)$, and then evolve it to other energy scales using the renormalization group equations of QCD.\n\nBy following this procedure, high-energy physics experiments can determine the strong coupling constant with high precision, providing a crucial test of the QCD theory and its predictions for the behavior of the strong force."
