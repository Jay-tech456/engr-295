    "message_2": "To calculate the temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole, we can use the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (ħc³) / (8πGMk)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) * (2.99792458 x 10^8 m/s)³ / (8π * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m³/kg s²) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) * (1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K))\n\nT ≈ 6.169 x 10^-9 K\n\nSo, the temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 6.169 x 10^-9 Kelvin."
