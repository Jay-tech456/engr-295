    "message_1": "A coaxial cable is carrying a current of 2 A in the center conductor and an equal current in the outer conductor in the opposite direction. The radius of the inner conductor is 1mm and the radius of the outer conductor is 3mm. Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the center of the coaxial cable.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, dl is the differential length element along the closed loop, and I is the current enclosed by the loop.\n\nSince the distance of 2mm is between the inner and outer conductors, we only need to consider the current in the inner conductor. The magnetic field will be in the form of concentric circles around the inner conductor.\n\nLet's consider a circular loop of radius 2mm centered at the center of the coaxial cable. The total current enclosed by this loop is 2 A (from the inner conductor).\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 2mm from the center of the coaxial cable.\n\nB⋅(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circular loop (2mm).\n\nWe know that the permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 2 A) / (2π × 2 × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (4 × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the center of the coaxial cable is 2 × 10^(-4) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current in the inner conductor is flowing in the positive direction, the magnetic field will be in the clockwise direction when looking at the cable from the positive side.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic field at a distance of 2mm from the center of the coaxial cable has a magnitude of 2 × 10^(-4) T and is in the clockwise direction when looking at the cable from the positive side."
