    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven the focal length f = -10 cm and the object distance u = -20 cm (negative because the object is on the same side as the image), we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/v - 1/(-20)\n\nTo solve for v, we can first simplify the equation:\n\n-1/10 + 1/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(-2 + 1) / 20 = 1/v\n\n-1/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can find the value of v by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = -20 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is typical for a concave lens. So, the image is formed 20 cm away from the lens.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (m) of the image using the formula:\n\nm = v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nm = (-20)/(-20)\n\nm = 1\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed 20 cm away from the lens on the same side as the object, and the magnification is 1, meaning the image is the same size as the object."
