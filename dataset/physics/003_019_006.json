    "message_1": "A coaxial cable has an inner conductor of radius 1mm and an outer conductor of radius 3mm. A current of 5A flows in the inner conductor in the direction of the axis of the cable. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2mm from the axis of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2mm from the axis of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (circumferential direction) and is symmetrical around the axis of the cable. Therefore, we can choose a circular loop of radius r (2mm in this case) centered at the axis of the cable as our Amperian loop.\n\nSince the magnetic field is uniform along the loop, we can write:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nHere, I_enclosed is the current enclosed by the Amperian loop. Since the loop is inside the inner conductor, the entire current of 5A is enclosed by the loop.\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The radius r is 2mm, which is 0.002m. The enclosed current is 5A.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5A) / (2π * 0.002m)\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.002m\n\nB = 1 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a radial distance of 2mm from the axis of the cable is 1 × 10^(-3) T, or 1 mT.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (along the axis of the cable), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in the azimuthal direction (circumferential direction) around the cable."
