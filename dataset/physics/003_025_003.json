    "message_1": "A 20 cm long straight copper wire with a diameter of 0.1 cm carries a current of 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire. (Assume the wire is an ideal resistor and neglect any external magnetic fields.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (0.05 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.05\n\nB = 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 1.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
