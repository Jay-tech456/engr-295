    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system of two neutron stars, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = 1 / T, where T is the orbital period.\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital, as gravitational waves are emitted at twice the orbital frequency.\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h): h = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * d), where G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the neutron stars, c is the speed of light, r is the orbital separation, and d is the distance to the binary system.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\nM1 = M2 = 1.4 solar masses = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\nOrbital radius (r) = 600 km = 6 x 10^5 m\nOrbital period (T) = 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 3600 s = 9000 s\n\n1. Calculate the orbital frequency:\nf_orbital = 1 / T = 1 / 9000 s = 1.111 x 10^-4 Hz\n\n2. Calculate the gravitational wave frequency:\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbital = 2 * 1.111 x 10^-4 Hz = 2.222 x 10^-4 Hz\n\n3. Calculate the gravitational wave amplitude:\nFirst, we need to find the distance to the binary system (d). Since it is not provided, we will assume a distance for the calculation. Let's assume the distance is 100 Mpc (about 3.086 x 10^23 meters).\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * d)\nh = (4 * (6.674 x 10^-11)^2 * 2.7846 x 10^30 * 2.7846 x 10^30) / ((2.998 x 10^8)^4 * 6 x 10^5 * 3.086 x 10^23)\nh â‰ˆ 1.22 x 10^-23\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary system is approximately 2.222 x 10^-4 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.22 x 10^-23 (assuming a distance of 100 Mpc)."
