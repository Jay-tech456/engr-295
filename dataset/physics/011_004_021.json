    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of the copper rod, we need to use the formula for the rate of heat transfer (Q) through the rod:\n\nQ = (k * A * ΔT) / L\n\nWhere:\nQ = rate of heat transfer (W)\nk = thermal conductivity (W/m·K)\nA = cross-sectional area (m^2)\nΔT = temperature difference between the ends (K)\nL = length of the rod (m)\n\nHowever, we are not given the rate of heat transfer (Q) in the problem. Instead, we are given the thermal diffusivity (α) of copper. We can use the relationship between thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, density (ρ), and specific heat capacity (c_p) to find the thermal conductivity:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c_p)\n\nWe know the thermal diffusivity (α) of copper is 1.11 × 10^-4 m^2/s. The density (ρ) of copper is approximately 8,960 kg/m^3, and the specific heat capacity (c_p) of copper is approximately 385 J/kg·K. Plugging these values into the equation, we can solve for the thermal conductivity (k):\n\nk = α * ρ * c_p\nk = (1.11 × 10^-4 m^2/s) * (8,960 kg/m^3) * (385 J/kg·K)\nk ≈ 387 W/m·K\n\nSo, the thermal conductivity of the copper rod is approximately 387 W/m·K."
