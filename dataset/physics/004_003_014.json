    "message_2": "The effect of a massive object on the curvature of spacetime is described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. According to this theory, a massive object causes spacetime to curve around it, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects in its vicinity, including the path of light. This is the basis for the phenomenon of gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when the light from a distant object, such as a star or galaxy, passes through the curved spacetime caused by a massive object, such as another galaxy or a black hole, that lies between the observer and the distant object. The light is bent due to the curvature of spacetime, causing the distant object to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nA relevant example of gravitational lensing is the famous \"Einstein Cross.\" In this case, a distant quasar (a very bright and active galactic nucleus) is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy. The mass of the foreground galaxy bends the light from the quasar, creating four distinct images of the quasar arranged in a cross-like pattern around the galaxy. This phenomenon was first observed in 1985 and provided strong evidence for the validity of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nTo summarize, a massive object causes spacetime to curve, which in turn affects the motion of other objects and the path of light. This leads to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, where the light from a distant object is bent and distorted as it passes through the curved spacetime caused by a massive foreground object. The Einstein Cross is a prime example of this phenomenon, showcasing the effects of gravitational lensing and providing evidence for the General Theory of Relativity."
