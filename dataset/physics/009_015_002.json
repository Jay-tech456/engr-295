    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens at different distances from the optical axis do not converge at the same point. To determine the spherical aberration present in the lens, we can use the formula for the longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA):\n\nLSA = (n - 1) * (D^4) / (64 * R^3 * F)\n\nwhere:\n- LSA is the longitudinal spherical aberration\n- n is the refractive index of the lens material\n- D is the diameter of the lens\n- R is the radius of curvature of the lens\n- F is the focal length of the lens\n\nGiven the values in the problem:\nn = 1.5\nD = 6 cm\nR = 100 cm (since 1 meter = 100 cm)\nF = 25 cm\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nLSA = (1.5 - 1) * (6^4) / (64 * 100^3 * 25)\nLSA = 0.5 * (1296) / (64 * 1000000 * 25)\nLSA = 648 / (16000000)\nLSA â‰ˆ 0.0000405 cm\n\nThe spherical aberration present in the lens is approximately 0.0000405 cm."
