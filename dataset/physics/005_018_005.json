Write down the wave equation for the particle's wave function and solve the equation for the wave function at a later time t. Also, find the probability density for finding the particle within a small distance dx of x = λ, where λ is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle.",
    "message_2": "To describe the wave function of a particle, we use the Schrödinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the wave function of a physical system changes over time. For a free particle (no potential energy), the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in one dimension is given by:\n\n(1) iħ ∂ψ(x, t) / ∂t = - (ħ² / 2m) ∂²ψ(x, t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the rest mass of the particle, and ψ(x, t) is the wave function of the particle.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the wave function can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nψ(x, t) = Ψ(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\niħ Ψ(x) dT(t) / dt = - (ħ² / 2m) T(t) d²Ψ(x) / dx²\n\nNow we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by Ψ(x)T(t):\n\n(iħ / T(t)) dT(t) / dt = (-ħ² / 2mΨ(x)) d²Ψ(x) / dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call E (the energy of the particle):\n\niħ dT(t) / dt = ET(t)\n- (ħ² / 2m) d²Ψ(x) / dx² = EΨ(x)\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve. The time-dependent equation is:\n\ndT(t) / dt = -i(E / ħ)T(t)\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\nT(t) = A exp(-i(E / ħ)t)\n\nwhere A is a constant.\n\nThe spatial equation is:\n\nd²Ψ(x) / dx² = -2mE / ħ² Ψ(x)\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\nΨ(x) = B exp(ikx) + C exp(-ikx)\n\nwhere B and C are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.\n\nNow we can write the full wave function as:\n\nψ(x, t) = (B exp(ikx) + C exp(-ikx)) * A exp(-i(E / ħ)t)\n\nTo find the probability density for finding the particle within a small distance dx of x = λ, we need to square the magnitude of the wave function:\n\nP(x) = |ψ(x, t)|² = |(B exp(ikx) + C exp(-ikx)) * A exp(-i(E / ħ)t)|²\n\nSince the de Broglie wavelength λ is related to the momentum p and mass m of the particle by λ = h / p = h / (mv), where h is the Planck constant, we can write the wave number k as:\n\nk = 2π / λ = mv / ħ\n\nNow we can evaluate the probability density at x = λ:\n\nP(λ) = |(B exp(ikλ) + C exp(-ikλ)) * A exp(-i(E / ħ)t)|²\n\nTo find the probability of finding the particle within a small distance dx of x = λ, we can integrate the probability density over that interval:\n\nP(x = λ ± dx/2) = ∫[λ-dx/2, λ+dx/2] P(x) dx\n\nSince we don't have specific values for the constants A, B, and C, we cannot compute an exact probability. However, this integral represents the probability of finding the particle within a small distance dx of x = λ."
