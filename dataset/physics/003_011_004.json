    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the disc is circular and has a uniform current density, we can consider a small circular ring of radius x and thickness dx on the disc. The area of this ring is dA = 2πx dx, and the current flowing through it is dI = (I/A) dA, where A is the total area of the disc.\n\nThe total area of the disc A = πR², where R is the radius of the disc (0.4 m). So, the current density I/A = 2.5 A / (π × 0.4² m²).\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field dB at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the disc due to the small circular ring. The position vector r is perpendicular to the plane of the ring and has a magnitude of 0.1 m. The length of the current element dl is the circumference of the ring, which is 2πx. Therefore, the magnetic field dB is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πx) / (0.1³)\n\nIntegrating dB over the entire disc (from x = 0 to x = R) will give us the total magnetic field B at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the disc:\n\nB = ∫(0 to R) (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 2πx) / (0.1³) dx\n\nFirst, let's find dI:\n\ndI = (I/A) dA = (2.5 A / (π × 0.4² m²)) * 2πx dx\n\nNow, substitute dI into the integral:\n\nB = ∫(0 to R) (μ₀ / 4π) * ((2.5 A / (π × 0.4² m²)) * 2πx dx * 2πx) / (0.1³) dx\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 A) / (0.4² m² * 0.1³) * ∫(0 to R) x² dx\n\nIntegrate x² with respect to x:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 A) / (0.4² m² * 0.1³) * (x³/3) | (0 to R)\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 2.5 A) / (0.4² m² * 0.1³) * (R³/3)\n\nNow, plug in the values for μ₀, I, and R:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (0.4² m² * 0.1³) * (0.4³/3)\n\nB ≈ (10⁻⁷ T * 2.5) / (0.016 m² * 0.001 m³) * (0.064/3)\n\nB ≈ (2.5 × 10⁻⁷ T) / (0.000016 m⁵) * (0.021333)\n\nB ≈ 3.34 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.1 m from the center of the disc is approximately 3.34 × 10⁻³ T."
