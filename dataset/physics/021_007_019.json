    "message_2": "The gravitational pull of a black hole affects the trajectory of nearby celestial objects, such as stars and planets, by exerting a strong gravitational force on them. This force can cause the objects to change their paths, either drawing them closer to the black hole or causing them to move away from it. The outcome depends on several factors, including the distance between the object and the black hole, the mass of the black hole, the mass of the object, and the object's initial velocity.\n\nThere are three main scenarios for how a celestial object might interact with a black hole:\n\n1. Capture: If the object is close enough to the black hole and moving slowly enough, it may be captured by the black hole's gravity and eventually be pulled into the event horizon, the point of no return. This process is known as accretion, and it can lead to the growth of the black hole as it consumes more matter.\n\n2. Stable orbit: If the object is moving at the right speed and distance from the black hole, it may enter a stable orbit around the black hole. In this case, the object will continue to orbit the black hole indefinitely, unless some external force disturbs its trajectory.\n\n3. Gravitational slingshot: If the object is moving fast enough and at the right angle, it can use the black hole's gravity to gain speed and change its trajectory, a process known as a gravitational slingshot. In this scenario, the object is not captured by the black hole but instead is flung away, often at a much higher velocity than before.\n\nThe specific outcome for a given celestial object depends on a combination of factors, including the initial conditions of the object's trajectory and the properties of the black hole. In general, objects that are closer to the black hole and moving more slowly are more likely to be captured, while those that are farther away and moving faster are more likely to be flung away or enter a stable orbit."
