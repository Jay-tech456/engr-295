    "message_2": "The gravitational interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in shaping the rotation curves of galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, we would expect the orbital speed to decrease as we move away from the center of the galaxy, similar to how planets in our solar system obey Kepler's laws. However, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show a different behavior.\n\nInstead of decreasing, the orbital speeds of stars and gas in galaxies tend to remain constant or even increase slightly as we move away from the center. This discrepancy between the expected and observed rotation curves is known as the galaxy rotation problem and is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. However, it does interact through gravity, and its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter. The flat or increasing rotation curves of galaxies can be explained if there is a significant amount of dark matter distributed in a halo around the galaxy, extending well beyond the visible disk.\n\nThe gravitational interaction between dark matter and normal matter in this halo provides the additional force needed to keep the stars and gas in the outer regions of the galaxy moving at the observed speeds. The presence of dark matter in galaxies can also explain other phenomena, such as the observed motion of galaxy clusters, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the presence of dark matter in galaxies:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: As mentioned earlier, the flat or increasing rotation curves of galaxies can be explained by the presence of dark matter in a halo around the galaxy.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter can bend light due to its gravitational influence, causing a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing effects around galaxy clusters provide strong evidence for the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. The observed patterns in the CMB radiation can be explained by the presence of dark matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational scaffolding for the formation of these structures.\n\n5. Galaxy cluster dynamics: The motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters and the distribution of hot gas in these clusters can be explained by the presence of dark matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the gravitational interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in shaping the rotation curves of galaxies, providing strong evidence for the presence of dark matter in these systems. This interaction also helps explain various other phenomena observed in the universe, making dark matter an essential component of our current understanding of cosmology and astrophysics."
