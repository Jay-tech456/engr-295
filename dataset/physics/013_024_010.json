    "message_2": "The maximum dose equivalent of cosmic radiation that an astronaut can receive during a single space mission depends on several factors, including the duration of the mission, the altitude and inclination of the spacecraft's orbit, and the level of solar activity. According to NASA, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive an average dose equivalent of about 0.5 to 2 millisieverts (mSv) per day, depending on these factors. For comparison, the average annual dose equivalent for people on Earth is about 3.1 mSv.\n\nFor a six-month mission on the ISS, an astronaut could receive a dose equivalent of up to 180-360 mSv. However, the dose equivalent can be significantly higher for missions beyond low Earth orbit, such as a mission to Mars, where astronauts could be exposed to up to 1000 mSv or more during the round trip.\n\nThe increased exposure to cosmic radiation during space missions raises the risk of developing cancer and other radiation-related illnesses for astronauts. According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), the acceptable career dose limit for astronauts is 1000 mSv, which corresponds to an estimated 3% increase in the risk of cancer mortality. This limit is based on the principle of minimizing the risk while still allowing for the benefits of human space exploration.\n\nIn addition to cancer, other potential health effects of cosmic radiation exposure include cataracts, cardiovascular diseases, and damage to the central nervous system. To mitigate these risks, spacecraft shielding, mission planning, and radiation monitoring are essential components of space missions. Additionally, ongoing research aims to better understand the biological effects of cosmic radiation and develop countermeasures to protect astronauts during long-duration space missions."
