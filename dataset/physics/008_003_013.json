    "message_1": "What is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino after traveling a distance of 735 km through the Earth's crust? Given that the initial flavor composition of the beam was 100% muon neutrino and the mixing parameters are known to be: sin^2(2θ13) = 0.085, sin^2(θ23) = 0.44, Δm^2(32) = 2.5 x 10^-3 eV^2.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(ν_μ → ν_e) = sin^2(2θ_13) * sin^2(θ_23) * sin^2((1.27 * Δm^2(32) * L) / E)\n\nwhere L is the distance traveled (735 km), E is the neutrino energy, and the other parameters are given in the problem.\n\nHowever, we do not have the value for the neutrino energy (E) in the problem statement. The probability of oscillation depends on the energy of the neutrino, so without this information, we cannot provide a specific probability value.\n\nIf you can provide the neutrino energy, we can calculate the probability of oscillation."
