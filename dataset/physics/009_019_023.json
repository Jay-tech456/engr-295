    "message_2": "To find the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum in Young's Double Slit Experiment, we can use the formula for the angular position of the maxima:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order number (in this case, m = 2 for the second-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light (632.8 nm), and d is the slit separation (0.25 mm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units to be consistent. Let's convert the wavelength to mm:\n\nλ = 632.8 nm * (1 mm / 1,000,000 nm) = 0.0006328 mm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nθ = (2 * 0.0006328 mm) / 0.25 mm\nθ ≈ 0.005056 rad\n\nTo find the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum, we can use the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and θ is the angle we calculated earlier. However, we don't have the value of L, so we can't find the exact distance y.\n\nIf you provide the distance between the screen and the slits (L), we can calculate the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum (y)."
