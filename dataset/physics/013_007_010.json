    "message_2": "The rotation period of the Milky Way galaxy can be estimated based on the observed velocities of stars in the outer regions of the galaxy. The Milky Way has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years, and the Sun is located about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center. The Sun orbits the galactic center at a speed of approximately 220 km/s.\n\nTo estimate the rotation period, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr) and divide it by the orbital speed of the Sun. The radius of the Sun's orbit is about 27,000 light-years, which is equivalent to 2.54 x 10^20 meters. Using this value, we can calculate the circumference of the Sun's orbit:\n\nC = 2π(2.54 x 10^20 m) ≈ 1.6 x 10^21 meters\n\nNow, we can divide the circumference by the Sun's orbital speed to find the time it takes for the Sun to complete one orbit around the Milky Way:\n\nT = C / v = (1.6 x 10^21 m) / (220 km/s) ≈ 7.3 x 10^15 seconds\n\nConverting this to years, we get:\n\nT ≈ 7.3 x 10^15 s * (1 year / 3.15 x 10^7 s) ≈ 230 million years\n\nSo, the approximate rotation period of the Milky Way galaxy based on observed velocities of stars in the outer regions of the galaxy is about 230 million years.\n\nThe expected rotation period based on the amount of visible matter in the galaxy would be different. According to the classical Newtonian gravity, the orbital speed should decrease as we move away from the galactic center. However, observations show that the orbital speed remains roughly constant even in the outer regions of the galaxy. This discrepancy between the observed and expected rotation periods is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter, which is believed to make up a significant portion of the mass in the galaxy and affects its overall gravitational behavior.\n\nIn summary, the approximate rotation period of the Milky Way galaxy based on observed velocities of stars in the outer regions is about 230 million years. This period is different from what would be expected based on the amount of visible matter in the galaxy, which provides evidence for the presence of dark matter."
