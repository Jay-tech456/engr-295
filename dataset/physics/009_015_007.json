    "message_2": "To determine the spherical aberration of the lens, we need to find the difference in focal lengths between the paraxial rays (rays close to the central axis) and the marginal rays (rays at the edge of the lens).\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of curvature (R) of the lens surfaces using the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nSince it's a biconvex lens, R1 and R2 have the same magnitude but opposite signs. Let R = R1 = -R2.\n\n1/f = (n-1)(2/R)\n\nNow, we can solve for R:\n\nR = 2(n-1)f\n\nR = 2(1.5-1)(10 cm)\nR = 20 cm\n\nNow, let's find the angle (θ) that the off-axis light rays make with the central axis:\n\nh = 2 cm (off-axis distance)\nr = R = 20 cm (radius of curvature)\n\nθ = arcsin(h/r)\nθ = arcsin(2 cm / 20 cm)\nθ = arcsin(0.1)\nθ ≈ 5.74°\n\nNow, we can use the sine condition to find the difference in focal lengths between the paraxial rays (f) and the marginal rays (f_m):\n\nsin(θ)/f_m = (n*sin(θ'))/f\n\nSince θ' is small, we can approximate sin(θ') ≈ θ':\n\nsin(θ)/f_m ≈ (n*θ')/f\n\nNow, we can solve for f_m:\n\nf_m ≈ f * sin(θ) / (n*θ')\n\nTo find θ', we can use the small angle approximation for the marginal rays:\n\nθ' ≈ h/f_m\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the equation for f_m:\n\nf_m ≈ f * sin(θ) / (n*h/f_m)\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nf_m^2 ≈ f * sin(θ) * f_m / (n*h)\n\nf_m ≈ f * sin(θ) / (n*h)\n\nf_m ≈ (10 cm) * sin(5.74°) / (1.5 * 2 cm)\n\nf_m ≈ 10 cm * 0.1 / 3\nf_m ≈ 0.333 cm\n\nNow, we can find the spherical aberration (Δf) by finding the difference between the focal lengths of the paraxial rays and the marginal rays:\n\nΔf = f - f_m\nΔf = 10 cm - 0.333 cm\nΔf ≈ 9.67 cm\n\nSo, the spherical aberration of the lens for off-axis light rays at a distance of 2 cm from the central axis is approximately 9.67 cm."
