    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum amount of energy required to separate Uranium-235 isotopes in a gas diffusion process, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = n * (kT * lnα)\n\nwhere:\nE = minimum energy required (in joules)\nn = number of moles of uranium to be separated\nk = Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10^-23 J/K)\nT = temperature (in Kelvin)\nα = separation factor (1.05 in this case)\n\nHowever, we need to know the number of moles of uranium to be separated and the temperature at which the process is carried out to calculate the minimum energy required. Since these values are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact minimum energy required for this process.\n\nIf you can provide the number of moles of uranium and the temperature, we can calculate the minimum energy required."
