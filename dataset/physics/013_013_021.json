    "message_2": "The maximum possible mass that a neutron star can have is approximately 2 to 2.5 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun). This limit is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The reason for this limit lies in the balance between two opposing forces: gravity and neutron degeneracy pressure.\n\nNeutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion. They are incredibly dense objects, with a mass typically around 1.4 solar masses and a radius of only about 10 kilometers. At such high densities, the protons and electrons in the core of the star combine to form neutrons, resulting in a predominantly neutron-based composition.\n\nGravity tries to compress the neutron star further, while the neutron degeneracy pressure, a quantum mechanical effect, opposes this compression. Neutron degeneracy pressure arises because neutrons, being fermions, cannot occupy the same quantum state as per the Pauli Exclusion Principle. As the neutron star's mass increases, the gravitational force becomes stronger, and the neutron degeneracy pressure has to increase to counteract it.\n\nHowever, there is a limit to how much mass a neutron star can have while still being supported by neutron degeneracy pressure. Beyond the TOV limit, the gravitational force becomes too strong for the neutron degeneracy pressure to counteract, and the neutron star collapses further, potentially forming a black hole.\n\nNow, let's discuss the connection between neutron stars and pulsars. A pulsar is a highly magnetized, rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed as pulses when the beam of emission is pointed towards the Earth, similar to the way a lighthouse beam appears to pulse as it rotates.\n\nThe properties and behavior of pulsars are related to those of neutron stars because pulsars are a subclass of neutron stars. The strong magnetic field of a pulsar, which can be billions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, is a result of the conservation of magnetic flux during the collapse of the progenitor star. The rapid rotation of pulsars is also a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum during the collapse.\n\nThe observed pulsar properties, such as pulse period, pulse shape, and pulse energy, are directly related to the underlying properties of the neutron star, such as its mass, radius, magnetic field strength, and rotation rate. By studying pulsars, astronomers can gain valuable insights into the properties and behavior of neutron stars, as well as the fundamental physics of matter at extreme densities."
