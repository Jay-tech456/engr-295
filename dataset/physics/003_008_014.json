    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of dimensions 2m x 1m carries a current of 5A. Calculate the magnetic field intensity at a point P located 4m above the center of the sheet.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field intensity at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point P.\n\nSince the sheet is rectangular and carries a uniform current, we can divide the sheet into small strips parallel to the shorter side (1m side) and calculate the magnetic field due to each strip and then integrate over the entire sheet.\n\nLet's consider a small strip of width dx at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the longer side (2m side). The length of the strip is 1m, and the current density is uniform, so the current in the strip is:\n\ndI = (5 A) * (dx / 2m)\n\nThe position vector r from the strip to point P is:\n\nr = <x, 0, 4>\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt(x^2 + 4^2)\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field due to the small strip at point P:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 1m x r) / |r|^3\n\nThe only component of the magnetic field that will not cancel out when integrating over the entire sheet is the vertical component (z-component). So, we only need to calculate the z-component of dB:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 1m * x) / (x^2 + 4^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate dBz over the entire sheet, from x = -1m to x = 1m:\n\nBz = ∫(dBz) from -1m to 1m\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫((5 A) * (dx / 2m) * 1m * x) / (x^2 + 4^2)^(3/2) from -1m to 1m\n\nBz = (5 * μ₀ / 8π) * ∫(x dx) / (x^2 + 4^2)^(3/2) from -1m to 1m\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2 + 4^2, then du = 2x dx:\n\nBz = (5 * μ₀ / 16π) * ∫(du) / u^(3/2) from u = 17 to u = 5\n\nBz = (5 * μ₀ / 16π) * [-2 / sqrt(u)] from u = 17 to u = 5\n\nBz = (5 * μ₀ / 16π) * [-2 / sqrt(5) + 2 / sqrt(17)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of μ₀:\n\nBz = (5 * (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 16π) * [-2 / sqrt(5) + 2 / sqrt(17)]\n\nBz ≈ -1.25 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the magnetic field is pointing downward. So, the magnetic field intensity at point P is approximately 1.25 × 10^(-7) T, directed downward."
