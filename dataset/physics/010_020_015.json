    "message_2": "To calculate the shear stress required to transform a pseudoplastic fluid into a dilatant fluid, we need to use the power-law model for non-Newtonian fluids. The power-law model is given by:\n\nτ = K * (du/dy)^n\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, K is the consistency index, du/dy is the shear rate, and n is the power-law index.\n\nFor the pseudoplastic fluid, we are given the viscosity (0.1 Pa·s) and the shear rate (10 s^-1). We can use the power-law model to find the consistency index (K) for the pseudoplastic fluid:\n\n0.1 Pa·s = K * (10 s^-1)^0.5\n\nSolving for K, we get:\n\nK = 0.1 Pa·s / (10 s^-1)^0.5 = 0.1 Pa·s / √10 s^-1 ≈ 0.0316 Pa·s^n\n\nNow, we want to find the shear stress (τ) required to transform the pseudoplastic fluid into a dilatant fluid with a power-law index of 1.5. We can use the power-law model again, but this time with the new power-law index (n = 1.5) and the same consistency index (K ≈ 0.0316 Pa·s^n):\n\nτ = 0.0316 Pa·s^n * (du/dy)^1.5\n\nWe are given the shear rate (du/dy = 10 s^-1), so we can plug that in:\n\nτ = 0.0316 Pa·s^n * (10 s^-1)^1.5\n\nτ ≈ 0.0316 Pa·s^n * 31.62 s^-1.5\n\nτ ≈ 1 Pa\n\nTherefore, the shear stress required to transform the pseudoplastic fluid into a dilatant fluid with a power-law index of 1.5 is approximately 1 Pa."
