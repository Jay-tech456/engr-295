    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the center of the sphere using the Biot-Savart law, we first need to find the current density J in the sphere. The volume of the sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\nV = (4/3) * π * (0.1 m)^3\nV = 4.19 × 10^(-3) m^3\n\nThe total current I is given as 5 A. The current density J can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / V\nJ = 5 A / 4.19 × 10^(-3) m^3\nJ = 1.19 × 10^3 A/m^3\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm (0.15 m) from the center of the sphere. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nHowever, the Biot-Savart law is not directly applicable to volume current distributions like the one in the copper sphere. Instead, we need to use the volume current density J and integrate over the entire volume of the sphere. The magnetic field at a point outside the sphere can be calculated as:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J × r) / r^3 dV\n\nSince the current density J is uniform and radial, the magnetic field B will be in the same direction as the position vector r. Therefore, we can simplify the expression as:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J * r) / r^3 dV\n\nNow, we can use spherical coordinates to perform the integration. The volume element in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\ndV = r^2 * sin(θ) * dr * dθ * dφ\n\nThe limits of integration for r, θ, and φ are:\n\nr: 0 to 0.1 m (radius of the sphere)\nθ: 0 to π\nφ: 0 to 2π\n\nThe position vector r at a distance of 15 cm (0.15 m) from the center of the sphere is given by:\n\nr = 0.15 m\n\nNow, we can perform the integration:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(0 to 0.1) ∫(0 to π) ∫(0 to 2π) (J * r^3 * sin(θ)) / (0.15 m)^3 dr dθ dφ\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * J * (0.15 m)^(-3) * ∫(0 to 0.1) r^3 dr * ∫(0 to π) sin(θ) dθ * ∫(0 to 2π) dφ\n\nAfter integrating, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * J * (0.15 m)^(-3) * (1/4) * (0.1 m)^4 * (-2) * (2π)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1.19 × 10^3 A/m^3) * (1/4) * (1 × 10^(-4) m^4) * (-2) * (2π) / (3.375 × 10^(-3) m^3)\n\nB = -1.77 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the center of the sphere is 1.77 × 10^(-5) T, and the direction is radially inward (negative sign indicates the direction is opposite to the position vector)."
