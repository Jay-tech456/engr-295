    "message_2": "To calculate the running coupling constant at the energy scale of 100 GeV in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), we need to use the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) and the beta function. The running coupling constant in QCD is denoted as αs(μ), where μ is the energy scale.\n\nThe RGE for the QCD coupling constant is given by:\n\ndαs(μ) / d ln(μ) = β(αs(μ))\n\nThe one-loop beta function for QCD is:\n\nβ(αs) = -b * αs^2 / (2π)\n\nwhere b = (11 * Nc - 2 * Nf) / 3, Nc is the number of colors (3 for QCD), and Nf is the number of active quark flavors. At the energy scale of 100 GeV, we have 5 active quark flavors (u, d, s, c, and b).\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of b:\n\nb = (11 * 3 - 2 * 5) / 3 = (33 - 10) / 3 = 23 / 3\n\nTo find the running coupling constant αs(μ) at the energy scale of 100 GeV, we need to integrate the RGE from an initial scale μ0 with a known value of αs(μ0). A common choice for the initial scale is the Z boson mass, μ0 ≈ 91.2 GeV, with a corresponding value of αs(μ0) ≈ 0.118.\n\nIntegrating the RGE, we get:\n\nαs(μ) = αs(μ0) / (1 + (b * αs(μ0) / (2π)) * ln(μ / μ0))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nαs(100 GeV) = 0.118 / (1 + (23 / 3 * 0.118 / (2π)) * ln(100 / 91.2))\n\nαs(100 GeV) ≈ 0.114\n\nSo, the running coupling constant at the energy scale of 100 GeV in QCD is approximately 0.114. Note that this calculation is based on the one-loop beta function, and higher-order corrections could lead to slightly different results."
