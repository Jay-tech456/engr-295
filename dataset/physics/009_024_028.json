    "message_1": "A beam of light is initially unpolarized and passes through two polarizers. The first polarizer has its transmission axis aligned vertically and reduces the intensity of the beam to 60%. The second polarizer has its transmission axis aligned horizontally. What would be the intensity of the beam after passing through the second polarizer?",
    "message_2": "When an unpolarized light beam passes through a polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light is reduced by half. In this case, the first polarizer reduces the intensity to 60%. Let's assume the initial intensity of the beam is I0. After passing through the first polarizer, the intensity becomes:\n\nI1 = 0.5 * I0\n\nSince the first polarizer has reduced the intensity to 60%, we have:\n\n0.6 * I0 = 0.5 * I0\nI1 = 0.6 * I0\n\nNow, the light passes through the second polarizer, which has its transmission axis aligned horizontally. The angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers is 90 degrees. The intensity of the transmitted light through the second polarizer can be calculated using Malus' law:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I2 is the intensity after passing through the second polarizer, I1 is the intensity after passing through the first polarizer, and theta is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, theta = 90 degrees, so cos^2(theta) = cos^2(90) = 0.\n\nI2 = 0.6 * I0 * 0 = 0\n\nThe intensity of the beam after passing through the second polarizer is 0. This means that no light is transmitted through the second polarizer since its transmission axis is orthogonal to the polarization direction of the light after passing through the first polarizer."
