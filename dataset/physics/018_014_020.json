    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational wave strain (h) generated by the collision of two black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * c) / (r * c^2)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the total mass of the system, which is the sum of the masses of the two black holes (30 + 35 = 65 solar masses)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- r is the distance from the source to the observer (1.3 billion light-years)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses and distance into SI units (kilograms and meters, respectively).\n\n1 solar mass = 1.9885 x 10^30 kg\n65 solar masses = 65 * 1.9885 x 10^30 kg = 1.293 x 10^32 kg\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n1.3 billion light-years = 1.3 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 m = 1.23 x 10^25 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.293 x 10^32 kg * 2.998 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.23 x 10^25 m * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nh â‰ˆ 1.3 x 10^-21\n\nThe magnitude of the gravitational wave strain generated by the collision of the two black holes is approximately 1.3 x 10^-21."
