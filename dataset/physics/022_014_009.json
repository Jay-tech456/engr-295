    "message_2": "The probability of dark matter being composed of primordial black holes (PBHs) is still uncertain, as there is no definitive evidence to confirm or refute this hypothesis. However, current observational constraints and theoretical models have significantly limited the possible mass ranges and fractions of dark matter that could be composed of PBHs.\n\nPrimordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They have been proposed as a candidate for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content but does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation.\n\nObservational constraints come from various sources, such as gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background radiation, and the distribution of large-scale structures in the universe. These observations have ruled out PBHs as the dominant form of dark matter for certain mass ranges. For example, PBHs with masses between 10^(-10) and 10^(-7) solar masses are strongly constrained by the effects of their gravitational lensing on the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nTheoretical models also provide constraints on the possible abundance of PBHs. For instance, the formation of PBHs in the early universe depends on the specifics of the inflationary model, which describes the rapid expansion of the universe shortly after the Big Bang. Some inflationary models predict a smaller abundance of PBHs, making it less likely that they could account for a significant fraction of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, while it is still possible that a fraction of dark matter could be composed of primordial black holes, current observational constraints and theoretical models have significantly limited the allowed mass ranges and abundances of PBHs. The exact probability is difficult to quantify, but it is clear that PBHs are not the most favored candidate for dark matter. Other candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, are currently more favored in the scientific community due to their compatibility with observational data and theoretical predictions. However, further research and observations are needed to definitively confirm or refute the role of PBHs in the composition of dark matter."
