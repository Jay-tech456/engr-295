    "message_2": "To estimate the minimum mass of a primordial black hole (PBH) required to explain the observed dark matter content of a typical galaxy, we first need to know the total mass of dark matter in a galaxy. For a typical galaxy like the Milky Way, the dark matter mass is estimated to be around 10^12 solar masses (M☉).\n\nPrimordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. If they exist, they could potentially account for some or all of the dark matter in the universe. However, there are constraints on the mass of PBHs based on various observations, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, gravitational lensing, and the survival of dwarf galaxies.\n\nConsidering these constraints, the minimum mass of a PBH that could explain the observed dark matter content of a typical galaxy would be around 10^-8 solar masses (M☉). This is a very small mass compared to the mass of a typical stellar black hole, which is usually several solar masses.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the minimum mass predicted by other dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are thought to make up dark matter. Their mass is usually expressed in terms of electron volts (eV) or gigaelectron volts (GeV). The mass of a WIMP is expected to be in the range of 10-1000 GeV, which is roughly 10^-37 to 10^-35 solar masses (M☉).\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum mass of a primordial black hole required to explain the observed dark matter content of a typical galaxy is much larger than the minimum mass predicted by other dark matter candidates such as WIMPs. However, it is important to note that the nature of dark matter is still an open question in physics, and more research is needed to determine the true identity of dark matter."
