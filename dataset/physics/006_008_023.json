    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), f is the frequency of the incident light, and W is the work function of the material.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the incident light. We can use the equation:\n\nc = λf\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and λ is the wavelength of the light (500 nm or 5 x 10^(-7) m).\n\nf = c / λ\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5 x 10^(-7) m)\nf = 6 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow we can find the energy of the incident photons:\n\nE_photon = hf\nE_photon = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) * (6 x 10^14 Hz)\nE_photon = 3.976 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNext, we need to convert the work function of sodium from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\nW = 2.28 eV * (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV)\nW = 3.652 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNow we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons:\n\nK_max = E_photon - W\nK_max = 3.976 x 10^(-19) J - 3.652 x 10^(-19) J\nK_max = 3.24 x 10^(-20) J\n\nThis is the maximum kinetic energy of a single emitted electron. To find the total kinetic energy of all emitted electrons, we need to find the number of photons incident on the sodium surface per second.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy per unit area per second (power density) of the incident light:\n\nPower density = Intensity / c\nPower density = 1.50 W/m² / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nPower density = 5 x 10^(-9) J/m²s\n\nNow we can find the number of photons incident on the sodium surface per unit area per second:\n\nNumber of photons = Power density / E_photon\nNumber of photons = (5 x 10^(-9) J/m²s) / (3.976 x 10^(-19) J/photon)\nNumber of photons = 1.257 x 10^10 photons/m²s\n\nFinally, we can find the total kinetic energy of all emitted electrons per unit area per second:\n\nTotal kinetic energy = Number of photons * K_max\nTotal kinetic energy = (1.257 x 10^10 photons/m²s) * (3.24 x 10^(-20) J/photon)\nTotal kinetic energy = 4.08 x 10^(-9) J/m²s\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted from a sodium atom when it is irradiated with light of wavelength 500 nm and an intensity of 1.50 W/m² is 4.08 x 10^(-9) J/m²s."
