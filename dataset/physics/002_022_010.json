    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of the sodium ion using the Debye-Hückel limiting law, we need the following equation:\n\nlog10(γ±) = -A * |z+ * z-| * sqrt(I) / (1 + B * a * sqrt(I))\n\nWhere:\nγ± is the mean activity coefficient of the ions in the solution\nA is a constant that depends on the temperature and the dielectric constant of the solvent (0.509 for water at 25°C)\nz+ and z- are the charges of the cation and anion, respectively (for NaCl, z+ = 1 and z- = -1)\nI is the ionic strength of the solution (0.2 M)\nB is another constant that depends on the temperature and the dielectric constant of the solvent (0.328 for water at 25°C)\na is the average ion size parameter (for NaCl, a = 0.5 nm or 0.5 * 10^-9 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nlog10(γ±) = -0.509 * |1 * -1| * sqrt(0.2) / (1 + 0.328 * 0.5 * 10^-9 * sqrt(0.2))\n\nlog10(γ±) = -0.509 * 1 * sqrt(0.2) / (1 + 0.328 * 0.5 * 10^-9 * sqrt(0.2))\n\nlog10(γ±) ≈ -0.227\n\nNow, we can find the activity coefficient (γ±) by taking the antilog:\n\nγ± = 10^(-0.227)\n\nγ± ≈ 0.595\n\nTherefore, the activity coefficient of the sodium ion in the 0.1 M NaCl solution at 25°C is approximately 0.595."
