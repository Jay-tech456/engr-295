    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.9c (90% of the speed of light) relative to Earth. If its rest mass is 100,000 kg, what is its relativistic mass?",
    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spaceship, we can use the following equation:\n\nrelativistic mass = rest mass / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the spaceship, c is the speed of light, and rest mass is the mass of the spaceship when it is not moving.\n\nGiven that the spaceship is traveling at 0.9c, we can plug in the values:\n\nrelativistic mass = 100,000 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\n\nrelativistic mass = 100,000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\n\nrelativistic mass = 100,000 kg / sqrt(0.19)\n\nrelativistic mass ≈ 100,000 kg / 0.43589\n\nrelativistic mass ≈ 229,365 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spaceship is approximately 229,365 kg."
