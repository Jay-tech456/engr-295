    "message_2": "When a black hole passes by a nearby planet and disturbs its gravitational balance, several outcomes are possible depending on the distance between the planet and the black hole, the mass of the black hole, and the relative velocities of the two objects. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\n1. Gravitational slingshot: If the black hole passes by at a relatively large distance, it can cause the planet to change its orbit around its parent star. The planet's velocity may increase or decrease, depending on the specific encounter geometry. This can lead to a more elliptical orbit or even eject the planet from its star system, sending it into interstellar space as a rogue planet.\n\n2. Tidal disruption: If the planet passes close enough to the black hole, the difference in gravitational forces acting on the near and far sides of the planet can cause tidal forces to stretch and compress the planet. This can lead to significant heating and deformation of the planet, potentially causing it to break apart or lose a significant portion of its mass.\n\n3. Capture by the black hole: In some cases, the planet may be captured by the black hole and become part of its accretion disk. This would involve the planet being torn apart by tidal forces and its material eventually being consumed by the black hole.\n\n4. Direct collision: Although highly unlikely, it is possible for the planet to collide directly with the black hole. In this case, the planet would be completely destroyed and its mass would be added to the black hole.\n\nThe exact outcome of a black hole passing by a nearby planet depends on the specific parameters of the encounter, but in general, the planet's orbit and fate can be significantly altered by the black hole's gravitational influence."
