    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nIn the case of the rectangular loop, we can break the loop into four segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the four segments as follows:\n1. Top segment (length 2 cm)\n2. Bottom segment (length 2 cm)\n3. Left segment (length 3 cm)\n4. Right segment (length 3 cm)\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the magnetic field at the center will be in the same direction (out of the plane), so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one of them and then multiply by 2.\n\nFor the left and right segments, the magnetic field at the center will also be in the same direction (out of the plane), so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one of them and then multiply by 2.\n\nLet's first calculate the magnetic field due to the top segment at the center:\n\ndB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl_top x r_top) / r_top³\n\nSince the current is flowing horizontally and the position vector is vertical, the cross product will result in a magnetic field coming out of the plane. The distance from the top segment to the center is 1.5 cm.\n\ndB_top = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (0.5 A * 0.02 m) / (0.015 m)²\ndB_top = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.01 A*m) / (0.000225 m²)\ndB_top = 4.44 x 10^(-5) T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the bottom segment is the same, the total magnetic field due to the top and bottom segments is:\n\nB_top_bottom = 2 * dB_top = 8.88 x 10^(-5) T\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to the left segment at the center:\n\ndB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl_left x r_left) / r_left³\n\nSince the current is flowing vertically and the position vector is horizontal, the cross product will result in a magnetic field coming out of the plane. The distance from the left segment to the center is 1 cm.\n\ndB_left = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (0.5 A * 0.03 m) / (0.01 m)²\ndB_left = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (0.015 A*m) / (0.0001 m²)\ndB_left = 1.5 x 10^(-4) T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the right segment is the same, the total magnetic field due to the left and right segments is:\n\nB_left_right = 2 * dB_left = 3 x 10^(-4) T\n\nFinally, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to all segments to find the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_total = B_top_bottom + B_left_right = 8.88 x 10^(-5) T + 3 x 10^(-4) T = 3.89 x 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is approximately 3.89 x 10^(-4) T."
