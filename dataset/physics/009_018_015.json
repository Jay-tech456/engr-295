    "message_1": "What is the distance between the two slits in a double-slit interference experiment if the distance between the screen and the slits is 1 meter, the distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe is 2.5 cm, and the wavelength of the light being used is 500 nm?",
    "message_2": "In a double-slit interference experiment, the distance between the bright fringes on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first-order bright fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given y = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m, λ = 500 nm = 5 × 10^(-7) m, and L = 1 m. We need to find d.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (m * λ * L) / y\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nd = (1 * 5 × 10^(-7) * 1) / 0.025\n\nd = 5 × 10^(-7) / 0.025\n\nd = 2 × 10^(-5) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit interference experiment is 2 × 10^(-5) meters or 20 micrometers."
