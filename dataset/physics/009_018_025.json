    "message_2": "In a double-slit interference experiment, the distance between the interference fringes (Δy) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔy = (λ * L) / d\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nΔy = 1.5 mm = 1.5 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\nL = 2 m\n\nWe need to find the value of d. Rearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (λ * L) / Δy\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nd = (650 * 10^(-9) * 2) / (1.5 * 10^(-3))\n\nd = (1300 * 10^(-9)) / (1.5 * 10^(-3))\n\nd = 1300 / 1500\n\nd ≈ 0.8667 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit interference experiment is approximately 0.8667 μm (micrometers)."
