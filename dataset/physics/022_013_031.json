    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter has significant effects on both the expansion rate of the universe and the distribution of galaxies. \n\n1. Expansion rate of the universe: Dark matter contributes to the overall mass-energy content of the universe. According to the Friedmann equations, which describe the expansion of the universe, the rate of expansion depends on the total mass-energy density. Since dark matter makes up about 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe, it plays a crucial role in determining the expansion rate. Dark matter's gravitational attraction slows down the expansion, but this effect is counteracted by dark energy, which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\n2. Distribution of galaxies: Dark matter plays a vital role in the formation and distribution of galaxies. Observations show that galaxies are distributed in a cosmic web-like structure, with clusters and filaments of galaxies separated by vast voids. This structure is primarily due to the gravitational influence of dark matter. \n\nDark matter forms an invisible scaffolding around which visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) can accumulate and form galaxies. The gravitational pull of dark matter attracts baryonic matter (ordinary matter) and helps it to collapse into dense regions, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies. Without dark matter, the gravitational forces would not be strong enough to form galaxies and hold them together in clusters.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter affects the expansion rate of the universe by contributing to its mass-energy content and slowing down the expansion. It also plays a crucial role in the formation and distribution of galaxies by providing the necessary gravitational force for their formation and organization into the cosmic web structure."
