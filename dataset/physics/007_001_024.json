    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in a nuclear fission reaction, we can use Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = Δm * c²\n\nwhere E is the energy released, Δm is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is:\n\n1 u = 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the mass defect in kg is:\n\nΔm = 0.186 u * (1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg/u) = 3.08860368388 x 10^-28 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released using the mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = (3.08860368388 x 10^-28 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)²\n\nE = 3.08860368388 x 10^-28 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m²/s²\n\nE = 2.77974331549 x 10^-11 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released in a nuclear fission reaction of one atom of uranium-235 is approximately 2.78 x 10^-11 Joules."
