    "message_1": "A student is asked to determine the coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump used in a residential building. The heat pump extracts heat energy from the outside air and transfers it to the indoor air to maintain a desired temperature inside. The heat pump requires 2 kW of electric power to produce 7 kW of heat energy. What is the COP of this heat pump?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is calculated as the ratio of the heat energy produced to the electric power consumed. In this case, the heat pump produces 7 kW of heat energy and consumes 2 kW of electric power. \n\nCOP = (Heat Energy Produced) / (Electric Power Consumed)\n\nCOP = 7 kW / 2 kW\n\nCOP = 3.5\n\nThe COP of this heat pump is 3.5."
