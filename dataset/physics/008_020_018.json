    "message_2": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a hypothetical process in which the flavor of a lepton changes during a weak interaction. In the Standard Model of particle physics, LFV is highly suppressed and practically unobservable. However, in some extensions of the Standard Model, such as those involving neutrino oscillations or supersymmetry, LFV can occur at a higher rate.\n\nThe probability of LFV occurring in rare decays involving muon and tau particles is not well-established, as it depends on the specific model and parameters considered. In general, the probability is expected to be very small, potentially on the order of 10^(-10) to 10^(-14) or even smaller.\n\nThe dependence of this probability on the energy of the particles involved is also model-dependent. In some cases, the probability may increase with energy, while in others, it may decrease or remain constant. To determine the precise relationship between the LFV probability and the energy of the particles, one would need to study the specific model and its parameters in detail.\n\nExperimental searches for LFV in muon and tau decays are ongoing, with current limits on the branching ratios being on the order of 10^(-8) to 10^(-10). Future experiments may be able to probe even smaller branching ratios, potentially shedding light on the nature of LFV and its connection to new physics beyond the Standard Model."
