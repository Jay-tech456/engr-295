    "message_2": "To determine the distance from the event horizon at which the spaceship will be pulled in by the black hole's gravity, we need to consider the concept of the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is the radius of the event horizon. The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nHowever, we also need to take into account the relativistic effects due to the spaceship's speed (0.8c). The relativistic mass of the spaceship (m') can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nm' = m / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the spaceship, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the gravitational force between the black hole and the spaceship:\n\nF = G * (m' * M) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m' is the relativistic mass of the spaceship, M is the mass of the black hole, and r is the distance between the spaceship and the black hole.\n\nAt the point where the spaceship is pulled in by the black hole's gravity, the gravitational force will be equal to the centripetal force required to keep the spaceship in a circular orbit around the black hole:\n\nF = m' * v^2 / r\n\nNow, we can set the two expressions for the force equal to each other and solve for r:\n\nG * (m' * M) / r^2 = m' * v^2 / r\n\nAfter canceling out m' and one factor of r, we get:\n\nr = GM / v^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for G, M, and v:\n\nr = (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * M / (0.8c)^2\n\nSince we don't have the mass of the black hole (M), we cannot provide a numerical answer for the distance r. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the distance from the event horizon at which the spaceship will be pulled in by the black hole's gravity once the mass of the black hole is known."
