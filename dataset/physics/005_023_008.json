The spaceship is at a distance of 10 times the event horizon radius from the black hole. Calculate the time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship crew compared to an observer at rest far away from the black hole.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor, we can use the Schwarzschild metric from general relativity. The time dilation factor, also known as the gravitational redshift factor, is given by:\n\nt_dilation = sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- r is the distance from the black hole to the spaceship\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the black hole in kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10^8 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^38 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius) of the black hole, which is given by:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nr_s = (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^38 kg) / (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 2.954 x 10^11 m\n\nThe spaceship is at a distance of 10 times the event horizon radius from the black hole:\n\nr = 10 * r_s = 10 * 2.954 x 10^11 m = 2.954 x 10^12 m\n\nNow we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\nt_dilation = sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\nt_dilation = sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^38 kg) / (2.954 x 10^12 m * (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\nt_dilation ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.204)\nt_dilation ≈ sqrt(0.796)\n\nt_dilation ≈ 0.892\n\nThe time dilation factor experienced by the spaceship crew compared to an observer at rest far away from the black hole is approximately 0.892. This means that time passes slower for the spaceship crew, and for every second that passes for them, approximately 1.121 seconds pass for the observer far away from the black hole."
