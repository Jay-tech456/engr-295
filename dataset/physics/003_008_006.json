    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located a distance 'd' above a current-carrying sheet with a surface current density of 'K', we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the sheet is infinite, we need to consider the contribution of the magnetic field from each part of the sheet.\n\nLet's consider an infinitesimal strip of width 'dx' at a distance 'x' from the point where we want to find the magnetic field. The length of the strip is assumed to be infinite (along the y-axis). The current in this strip is given by:\n\ndI = K * dx\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field due to this strip at the point located at a distance 'd' above the sheet:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl) / r^2\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, dl is an infinitesimal length along the strip, and r is the distance from the point to the infinitesimal length dl.\n\nSince the strip is parallel to the y-axis, the magnetic field due to the strip will have components in the x and z directions. We can find these components by considering the geometry of the problem. Let's denote the angle between the line connecting the point to the infinitesimal length dl and the x-axis as θ. Then, we have:\n\ndBx = dB * cos(θ)\ndBz = dB * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we need to integrate these components over the entire sheet to find the total magnetic field at the point:\n\nBx = ∫ dBx = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * cos(θ)) / r^2\nBz = ∫ dBz = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * sin(θ)) / r^2\n\nDue to symmetry, the x-components of the magnetic field will cancel out, leaving only the z-component:\n\nBz = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * sin(θ)) / r^2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following substitutions:\n\nsin(θ) = x / r\ncos(θ) = d / r\nr = √(x^2 + d^2)\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nBz = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (K * dx * d * dl) / (x^2 + d^2)^(3/2)\n\nSince the sheet is infinite, the limits of integration are from -∞ to +∞. After integrating, we get:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * K * d) / (2 * π)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located a distance 'd' above a current-carrying sheet with a surface current density of 'K' is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * K * d) / (2 * π) in the z-direction"
