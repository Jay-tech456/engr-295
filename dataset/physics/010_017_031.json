    "message_1": "A long thin elastic beam is submerged in water with one end fixed and one end free to move. The water is flowing parallel to the length of the beam with a velocity of 2 m/s. Calculate the natural frequency of vibration of the beam when it is fully submerged in water assuming all other parameters are known.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the natural frequency of vibration of the beam when it is fully submerged in water, we need to consider the added mass effect due to the water surrounding the beam. The natural frequency of a cantilever beam can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(k / m)\n\nwhere f is the natural frequency, k is the stiffness of the beam, and m is the mass of the beam.\n\nWhen the beam is submerged in water, the effective mass of the beam increases due to the added mass effect. The added mass (m_a) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nm_a = C_a * ρ * V\n\nwhere C_a is the added mass coefficient (typically around 1 for long thin beams), ρ is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m³), and V is the volume of the beam.\n\nThe total mass (m_t) of the submerged beam is the sum of the mass of the beam (m) and the added mass (m_a):\n\nm_t = m + m_a\n\nNow, we can calculate the natural frequency of the submerged beam using the total mass:\n\nf_submerged = (1 / 2π) * √(k / m_t)\n\nHowever, we need more information about the beam's dimensions, material properties, and mass to calculate the actual natural frequency."
