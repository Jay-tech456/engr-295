    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nn = 200 turns/meter\nI = 2.5 Amps\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (200 turns/m) * (2.5 A)\n\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10^(-6) Tm/A) * (500 turns)\n\nB ≈ 0.6283 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid is approximately 0.6283 Tesla."
