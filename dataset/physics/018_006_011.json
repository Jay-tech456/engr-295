    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, as well as on the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThere are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter surrounding the galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These observations indicate that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal patterns that can be explained by the presence of dark matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Simulations of the formation of cosmic structures, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters, require the presence of dark matter to match the observed distribution of these structures in the universe.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a pair of colliding galaxy clusters that provide direct evidence for dark matter. Observations of the cluster show that the visible matter (mostly in the form of hot gas) is separated from the majority of the mass, which is inferred to be dark matter through gravitational lensing.\n\nDark matter is believed to interact with ordinary matter primarily through gravity. It does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which means it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. This makes it extremely difficult to detect directly. There are ongoing experiments searching for other possible interactions between dark matter and ordinary matter, such as through weak nuclear forces. These experiments typically involve highly sensitive detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation.\n\nThe exact nature and composition of dark matter remain unknown, but the leading candidate is a class of particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Other possibilities include axions, sterile neutrinos, and modifications to our understanding of gravity. Researchers continue to search for direct evidence of dark matter particles and to refine our understanding of its properties and interactions with ordinary matter."
