    "message_2": "The current status of the search for dark matter particles beyond the Standard Model is that it remains an open question in physics. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to account for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nSeveral particle candidates have been proposed to explain dark matter, with the most popular being Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions. WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and have a mass in the range of 10 to 10,000 times the mass of a proton. Axions, on the other hand, are very light particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nOver the past few decades, numerous experiments have been conducted to search for dark matter particles, including direct detection experiments, indirect detection experiments, and collider experiments. Direct detection experiments, such as the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment and the XENON1T experiment, aim to observe the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei in a detector. Indirect detection experiments, such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay. Collider experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), attempt to produce dark matter particles in high-energy collisions between known particles.\n\nDespite these efforts, no conclusive evidence for dark matter particles has been found yet. However, new and upgraded experiments are underway, which could potentially lead to a breakthrough in the coming years. For example, the XENONnT experiment, an upgrade of the XENON1T experiment, is expected to have a significantly increased sensitivity to WIMP dark matter. The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment, another direct detection experiment, is also expected to improve the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter by an order of magnitude compared to previous experiments. In addition, the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) is searching for axions with unprecedented sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, the search for dark matter particles beyond the Standard Model is still ongoing, with no definitive discoveries made so far. However, new and upgraded experiments in the coming years have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of dark matter and may finally reveal the elusive particles responsible for this mysterious phenomenon."
