    "message_2": "The age of the universe, based on the current understanding of relativistic cosmology, is approximately 13.8 billion years. This estimate is primarily derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble constant.\n\nThere are several key assumptions made to arrive at this estimate:\n\n1. The Cosmological Principle: This principle assumes that the universe is homogeneous (uniform) and isotropic (the same in all directions) on large scales. This means that the overall structure and properties of the universe are the same everywhere, and there are no special or preferred locations.\n\n2. The Big Bang Model: This model assumes that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The CMB radiation is a key piece of evidence supporting this model.\n\n3. The Lambda-CDM Model: This is the standard model of cosmology, which includes the presence of dark energy (represented by the cosmological constant, Lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM). This model assumes that the universe is composed of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter.\n\n4. General Relativity: The age of the universe is calculated using the equations of general relativity, which describe the relationship between matter, energy, and the geometry of spacetime. These equations allow for the calculation of the expansion history of the universe and its age.\n\nBy combining observations of the CMB, the Hubble constant, and other cosmological data with these assumptions, scientists have been able to estimate the age of the universe to be around 13.8 billion years, with a small uncertainty. However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on our current understanding of cosmology, and future discoveries or refinements in our understanding could lead to revisions in this value."
