    "message_2": "The estimated rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the types of sources being observed, and the observational capabilities of the instruments. \n\nAs of now, LIGO and Virgo have detected gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, binary neutron star mergers, and a possible black hole-neutron star merger. KAGRA is a newer observatory that is expected to join the network soon, which will improve the overall detection capabilities.\n\nThe detection rate of gravitational waves can be expressed in terms of events per year. The current estimates for detection rates are as follows:\n\n1. Binary black hole mergers: The detection rate is estimated to be between 9 and 240 events per year, with a most likely value of around 50 events per year.\n\n2. Binary neutron star mergers: The detection rate is estimated to be between 80 and 800 events per year, with a most likely value of around 320 events per year.\n\n3. Black hole-neutron star mergers: The detection rate is less certain, with estimates ranging from 0.2 to 300 events per year.\n\nThese estimates are based on the current sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo and assume that the detectors are operating at their design sensitivity. As the sensitivity of these instruments improves, the detection rate will increase. For example, LIGO is expected to undergo upgrades in the coming years that will increase its sensitivity by a factor of 2-3, which could lead to a significant increase in the detection rate.\n\nThe addition of KAGRA to the network will also improve the detection capabilities, as it will help to better localize the sources of gravitational waves and increase the overall sensitivity of the network. This will, in turn, increase the detection rate.\n\nIn summary, the estimated rate of gravitational wave detections depends on the sensitivity and observational capabilities of the instruments involved. As these improve, the detection rate is expected to increase, allowing for more frequent observations of gravitational wave events."
