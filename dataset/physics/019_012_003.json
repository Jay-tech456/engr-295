    "message_2": "Calculating non-perturbative effects in the context of quantum field theory for systems with strong coupling, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is a challenging task. However, there are several methods that have been developed to tackle this problem. Some of the most common methods include:\n\n1. Lattice QCD: Lattice QCD is a non-perturbative approach that involves discretizing spacetime into a lattice and then solving the QCD equations numerically. This method allows for the calculation of non-perturbative quantities, such as the masses of hadrons and their interactions. The main limitation of lattice QCD is that it requires significant computational resources, and the results can be sensitive to the choice of lattice spacing and the extrapolation to the continuum limit.\n\n2. Effective field theories: Effective field theories (EFTs) are a way to describe the low-energy behavior of a strongly coupled system by integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom. In the context of QCD, EFTs such as chiral perturbation theory and heavy quark effective theory have been developed to describe the interactions of light and heavy quarks, respectively. These EFTs allow for the calculation of non-perturbative effects in a systematic and controlled manner.\n\n3. Dyson-Schwinger equations: Dyson-Schwinger equations are a set of integral equations that describe the Green's functions of a quantum field theory. These equations can be used to study non-perturbative effects in QCD by solving them in a self-consistent manner. This approach has been used to calculate properties of quarks and gluons, as well as their bound states, such as mesons and baryons.\n\n4. AdS/CFT correspondence: The AdS/CFT correspondence is a duality between a strongly coupled gauge theory and a weakly coupled gravity theory in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This duality has been used to study non-perturbative effects in QCD by mapping the strongly coupled QCD system to a weakly coupled gravity system, which can be more easily analyzed.\n\n5. Functional renormalization group: The functional renormalization group (FRG) is a method that allows for the study of the renormalization group flow of a quantum field theory. By solving the FRG equations, one can obtain non-perturbative information about the fixed points and scaling behavior of the theory. This method has been applied to QCD to study the phase structure and critical behavior of the theory.\n\nThese methods, among others, provide valuable tools for calculating non-perturbative effects in strongly coupled systems like QCD. However, each method has its own limitations and challenges, and further research is needed to improve their accuracy and applicability."
