    "message_2": "The maximum amount of information that can be stored on the event horizon of a black hole is determined by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which is a measure of the black hole's entropy based on its surface area. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is given by the formula:\n\nS = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, A is the surface area of the event horizon, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is proportional to the number of bits of information it can store. To convert the entropy to bits, we can divide the entropy by the Boltzmann constant (k) and take the logarithm base 2:\n\nI = S / k = (A * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nwhere I is the number of bits of information.\n\nThe surface area of the event horizon of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nA = 4 * pi * r^2\n\nwhere r is the Schwarzschild radius, which is given by:\n\nr = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the surface area into the formula for the number of bits of information, we get:\n\nI = (4 * pi * r^2 * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nNow, substituting the expression for the Schwarzschild radius, we get:\n\nI = (4 * pi * ((2 * G * M) / c^2)^2 * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nI = (16 * pi * G^2 * M^2) / (hbar * c)\n\nThis formula gives the maximum amount of information that can be stored on the event horizon of a black hole of mass M before it reaches its maximum capacity, as predicted by the principles of quantum gravity."
