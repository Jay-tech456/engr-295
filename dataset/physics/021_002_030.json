    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius equation is given by:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (size of the event horizon), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 6 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 6 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.1934 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius equation:\n\nR_s = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 1.1934 × 10^31 kg) / (3.0 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ 1.771 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the size of the event horizon of a black hole with a mass of 6 solar masses is approximately 17,710 meters or 17.71 kilometers."
