    "message_2": "To find the force experienced by the particle due to the magnetic field, we can use the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF = q(v x B)\n\nHere, F is the force experienced by the particle, q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity vector of the particle, and B is the magnetic field vector. The \"x\" symbol represents the cross product between the velocity and magnetic field vectors.\n\nGiven that the particle is moving in the x-direction with a constant velocity v, we can represent the velocity vector as:\n\nv = v * i (where i is the unit vector in the x-direction)\n\nThe magnetic field is given in the negative y-direction, so we can represent the magnetic field vector as:\n\nB = -B * j (where j is the unit vector in the y-direction)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product between the velocity and magnetic field vectors:\n\nv x B = (v * i) x (-B * j)\n\nUsing the cross product rule for unit vectors, we know that i x j = k (where k is the unit vector in the z-direction). Therefore:\n\nv x B = (v * (-B)) * k = -vB * k\n\nNow, we can find the force experienced by the particle:\n\nF = q(v x B) = q(-vB * k)\n\nSo, the force experienced by the particle due to the magnetic field is:\n\nF = -qvB * k\n\nThis force is in the negative z-direction, which means the particle will experience a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field, causing it to move in a circular path."
