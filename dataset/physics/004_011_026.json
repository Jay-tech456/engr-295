    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a charged, non-rotating black hole. The event horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole is determined by the following equation:\n\nr± = GM/c² ± √((GM/c²)² - GQ²/c⁴)\n\nwhere r± are the outer (r+) and inner (r-) event horizons, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and Q is the charge of the black hole.\n\nGiven the charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) of 0.5, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nr± = GM/c² ± √((GM/c²)² - G²(Q/M)²M²/c⁴)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values of G and c:\n\nG = 6.674 × 10^(-11) m³ kg^(-1) s^(-2)\nc = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s\n\nr± = (6.674 × 10^(-11) M) / (2.998 × 10^8)² ± √(((6.674 × 10^(-11) M) / (2.998 × 10^8)²)² - (6.674 × 10^(-11))²(0.5)²M² / (2.998 × 10^8)⁴)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by GM/c²:\n\nr±/(GM/c²) = 1 ± √(1 - (0.5)²)\n\nr±/(GM/c²) = 1 ± √(1 - 0.25)\n\nr±/(GM/c²) = 1 ± √(0.75)\n\nNow, we can find the outer event horizon (r+):\n\nr+/(GM/c²) = 1 + √(0.75) ≈ 1.866\n\nr+ = 1.866(GM/c²)\n\nSimilarly, we can find the inner event horizon (r-):\n\nr-/(GM/c²) = 1 - √(0.75) ≈ 0.134\n\nr- = 0.134(GM/c²)\n\nSo, the event horizons of a Reissner-Nordström black hole with a charge-to-mass ratio of 0.5 are:\n\nOuter event horizon (r+): r+ = 1.866(GM/c²)\nInner event horizon (r-): r- = 0.134(GM/c²)"
