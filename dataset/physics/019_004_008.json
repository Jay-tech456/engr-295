    "message_2": "In the framework of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the cross-section for electron-proton scattering can be calculated using the Møller (for electron-electron) or Bhabha (for electron-positron) scattering formulas. However, when considering electron-proton scattering in a hydrogen atom, we need to take into account the bound state of the electron in the atom.\n\nThe cross-section for electron-proton scattering in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the first Born approximation, which is a perturbative method used to approximate the scattering amplitude. The result is given by the Mott cross-section formula, which is derived from the Rutherford cross-section formula by including the effects of QED.\n\nThe Mott cross-section formula is given by:\n\nσ = (α^2 * h^2 * c^2) / (4 * E^2 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant, h is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, E is the energy of the incident electron, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nThis formula provides an approximation for the cross-section of electron-proton scattering in a hydrogen atom within the framework of QED. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified approach, and more accurate calculations would require considering higher-order corrections and the full complexity of the QED framework."
