    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to calculate the numerical aperture of an optical fiber that has a core refractive index of 1.47 and a cladding refractive index of 1.45. The core has a diameter of 50 μm and the cladding has a thickness of 10 μm. What is the numerical aperture of the fiber?",
    "message_2": "The numerical aperture (NA) of an optical fiber is a measure of its light-gathering ability and is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle (θ) for light to be guided through the fiber. The numerical aperture can be calculated using the refractive indices of the core (n1) and the cladding (n2) with the following formula:\n\nNA = √(n1^2 - n2^2)\n\nGiven the core refractive index (n1) of 1.47 and the cladding refractive index (n2) of 1.45, we can calculate the numerical aperture as follows:\n\nNA = √((1.47)^2 - (1.45)^2)\nNA = √(2.1609 - 2.1025)\nNA = √(0.0584)\n\nNA ≈ 0.2417\n\nTherefore, the numerical aperture of the optical fiber is approximately 0.2417."
