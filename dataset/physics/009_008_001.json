    "message_2": "To locate the image of the object formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 15 cm, u = -40 cm (object distance is negative for real objects in front of the mirror)\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (v):\n\n1/15 = 1/(-40) + 1/v\n\n1/v = 1/15 + 1/40\n\n1/v = (40 + 15) / (15 * 40)\n\n1/v = 55 / 600\n\nv = 600 / 55\n\nv ≈ -10.91 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image. The image distance is approximately 10.91 cm from the mirror.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-10.91)/(-40)\n\nM = 10.91/40\n\nM ≈ 0.273\n\nThe magnification is less than 1, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. The image is formed at approximately 10.91 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object.\n2. The image is smaller than the object, with a magnification of approximately 0.273.\n3. The image is virtual and erect (upright).\n\nAs for the ray diagram, it's not possible to draw it here, but you can follow these steps to draw it on paper:\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line representing the principal axis and a vertical line representing the mirror.\n2. Mark the focal point (F) at 15 cm from the mirror along the principal axis.\n3. Draw the object as an arrow perpendicular to the principal axis at 40 cm from the mirror.\n4. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object to the mirror, then reflect it through the focal point.\n5. Draw another ray from the top of the object through the focal point to the mirror, then reflect it parallel to the principal axis.\n6. The point where the reflected rays meet (or appear to meet) is the location of the image."
