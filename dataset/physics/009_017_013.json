    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum on the screen, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the laser, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 400 nm = 400 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 400 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 4 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(4 * 10^(-6))\n\nSince the angle is very small, we can approximate sin(θ) ≈ θ:\n\nθ ≈ 4 * 10^(-6) radians\n\nNow, we can use the small angle approximation to find the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum, and L is the distance between the slit and the screen (2 meters).\n\ny ≈ 2 * (4 * 10^(-6))\ny ≈ 8 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum on the screen is approximately 8 * 10^(-6) meters or 8 μm."
