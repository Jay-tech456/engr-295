    "message_2": "In a typical Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star, the primary nuclear process responsible for energy production is the fusion of helium and hydrogen in two distinct burning shells. These shells are the helium-burning shell and the hydrogen-burning shell. The helium-burning shell undergoes the triple-alpha process, where three helium nuclei (alpha particles) combine to form a carbon nucleus. The hydrogen-burning shell undergoes the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle, where hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium.\n\nDuring the AGB phase, the star experiences thermal pulses, which are periodic episodes of helium shell flashes. These thermal pulses cause the outer layers of the star to expand, and the star's luminosity increases. The thermal pulses also lead to the mixing of material between the helium and hydrogen-burning shells, a process known as the third dredge-up. This dredge-up brings the products of helium burning, such as carbon and oxygen, to the surface of the star.\n\nThe formation of neutron-rich heavy elements in AGB stars occurs through a process called slow neutron capture, or the s-process. The s-process takes place in the helium-burning shell during thermal pulses when neutrons are released from the reactions between carbon-13 and helium-4 or from the reactions between neon-22 and helium-4. These free neutrons are then captured by seed nuclei, which are typically iron-group elements. The seed nuclei gradually capture neutrons and undergo beta decays, forming heavier, neutron-rich isotopes.\n\nAs the AGB star evolves, it loses mass through stellar winds, which carry the products of nucleosynthesis, including the neutron-rich heavy elements formed by the s-process, into the interstellar medium. This material can then be incorporated into the formation of new stars and planetary systems, contributing to the chemical evolution of the galaxy."
