    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section (σ) can be calculated using the Mott formula, which is given by:\n\nσ(θ) = (Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε0))^2 * (1 / (4 * E * sin^4(θ/2))) * (1 - β^2 * cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere:\n- Z is the atomic number of the target atom (Z = 2 for helium)\n- e is the elementary charge (e ≈ 1.602 × 10^(-19) C)\n- ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε0 ≈ 8.854 × 10^(-12) C^2 / (N * m^2))\n- E is the incident electron energy in joules\n- θ is the scattering angle in radians\n- β is the velocity of the incident electron divided by the speed of light (c)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given electron energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\nE = 100 eV * (1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV) ≈ 1.602 × 10^(-17) J\n\nNext, we need to calculate the velocity of the incident electron (v) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE = (m * c^2) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) - m * c^2\n\nwhere m is the electron rest mass (m ≈ 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg) and c is the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv ≈ 5.931 × 10^7 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate β:\n\nβ = v / c ≈ 0.1977\n\nNext, we need to convert the scattering angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30° * (π / 180) ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Mott scattering cross section:\n\nσ(θ) ≈ 1.039 × 10^(-20) m^2\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for helium atoms at an incident electron energy of 100 eV and a scattering angle of 30 degrees is approximately 1.039 × 10^(-20) m^2."
