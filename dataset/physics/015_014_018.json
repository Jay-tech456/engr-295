    "message_2": "To determine the minimum mass of a primordial black hole (PBH) population required to achieve a detectable gravitational wave (GW) signal using current observational technology, we need to consider the sensitivity of the detectors and the expected GW signal from the PBH population.\n\nCurrent gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are most sensitive to GW signals in the frequency range of ~10 Hz to a few kHz. These detectors are primarily designed to detect GW signals from the coalescence of binary systems, such as binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs).\n\nFor a PBH population to produce a detectable GW signal, the PBHs must form binaries and merge within the sensitive frequency range of the detectors. The GW signal strength depends on the masses of the merging PBHs, their distance from the detectors, and the merger rate.\n\nRecent studies have shown that PBHs with masses in the range of ~1 to 100 solar masses (M☉) could potentially contribute to the observed BBH mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo. However, the minimum mass required for a detectable signal depends on the specific assumptions about the PBH population, such as their mass distribution, spatial distribution, and formation mechanisms.\n\nAs a rough estimate, we can consider the lower end of the mass range for PBHs that could contribute to the observed BBH mergers. If we assume that PBHs with masses of ~1 M☉ can produce detectable GW signals, then a population of PBHs with a total mass of at least several solar masses would be required to have a reasonable chance of forming binaries and merging within the sensitive frequency range of the detectors.\n\nIt is important to note that this estimate is subject to uncertainties in the properties of the PBH population and the sensitivity of the detectors. Future improvements in GW detectors, such as the planned LIGO A+ upgrade and the proposed Einstein Telescope, will increase the sensitivity and frequency range of the detectors, potentially allowing for the detection of GW signals from lower-mass PBH populations."
