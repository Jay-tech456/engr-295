    "message_2": "Current estimates suggest that dark matter constitutes approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. This value is derived from a combination of observational evidence and theoretical modeling. The remaining mass-energy content of the universe is composed of about 68% dark energy and about 5% ordinary (baryonic) matter.\n\nThe determination of dark matter abundance has been achieved through several independent methods:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide valuable information about the composition of the universe. By analyzing the CMB power spectrum, which describes the distribution of temperature fluctuations at different angular scales, scientists can infer the relative abundances of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter. The Planck satellite mission, for example, has provided precise measurements of the CMB, leading to the current estimates of dark matter abundance.\n\n2. Large Scale Structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Observations of the large scale structure, such as galaxy clustering and the distribution of galaxy clusters, can be used to constrain the amount of dark matter. Theories like the Lambda-CDM model, which incorporates dark matter and dark energy, can be tested against these observations to determine the best-fit values for the abundance of dark matter.\n\n3. Gravitational Lensing: Dark matter can bend light due to its gravitational influence, an effect known as gravitational lensing. By studying the distortion of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive foreground structures, astronomers can map the distribution of dark matter and estimate its abundance. Surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) have used weak gravitational lensing to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\n4. Galaxy Rotation Curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars and gas in galaxies provide evidence for the existence of dark matter. The observed rotation curves, which show the relationship between the rotation speed and distance from the galactic center, do not match the expected curves based on the visible matter alone. The discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxies, and the amount of dark matter can be estimated from these rotation curves.\n\nBy combining the results from these various methods, astronomers and physicists have arrived at the current estimates of the abundance of dark matter in the universe. Ongoing research and future missions, such as the Euclid satellite and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will continue to refine our understanding of dark matter and its role in the cosmos."
