    "message_2": "To produce a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV/c², the particle accelerator must provide at least the same amount of energy as the rest mass energy of the Higgs boson. The minimum energy required can be calculated using the famous Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = mc²\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass of the Higgs boson (125 GeV/c²), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nHowever, since we are given the mass in GeV/c², we can directly say that the minimum energy required is 125 GeV (giga-electronvolts), as the c² in the mass unit cancels out with the c² in the energy unit.\n\nKeep in mind that this is the theoretical minimum energy required. In practice, particle accelerators need to provide more energy than this due to various inefficiencies and the fact that the Higgs boson is produced in high-energy collisions between other particles, such as protons. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, for example, operated at energies of around 13 TeV (tera-electronvolts) when the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012."
