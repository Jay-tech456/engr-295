    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nGiven:\nResistivity of copper (ρ) = 1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm\nLength of the wire (L) = 25 cm = 0.25 m (converted to meters)\nCross-sectional area (A) = 2 mm² = 2 × 10^-6 m² (converted to square meters)\n\nNow, we can calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm) × (0.25 m) / (2 × 10^-6 m²)\nR = 4.2 × 10^-9 Ω\n\nNext, we can find the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ = 5.95 × 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.95 × 10^7 S/m."
