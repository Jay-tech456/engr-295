    "message_2": "The maximum efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (Tc/Th)\n\nwhere Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, Tc = 300 K and Th = 500 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K)\nEfficiency = 1 - 0.6\nEfficiency = 0.4\n\nThe maximum efficiency of the Carnot engine operating between these two reservoirs is 40%."
