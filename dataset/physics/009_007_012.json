    "message_2": "To determine the focal length of the convex lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance (distance between the object and the lens), and v is the image distance (distance between the lens and the image formed).\n\nIn this case, u = 20 cm and v = 80 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n1/f = 1/20 + 1/80\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can multiply the fractions by 4 and 1, respectively:\n\n1/f = 4/80 + 1/80\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\n1/f = 5/80\n\nTo find the focal length (f), we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nf = 80/5\n\nf = 16 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the convex lens is 16 cm."
