    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water is the amount of heat energy required to transform 1 kg of water from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase without changing its temperature. At a pressure of 1 atm (101.3 kPa) and a temperature of 100°C, the latent heat of vaporization of water is approximately 2260 kJ/kg.\n\nTo calculate the energy required to vaporize 1 kg of water under these specific conditions, we can use the following formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × latent heat of vaporization (L_v)\n\nwhere\nm = 1 kg (mass of water)\nL_v = 2260 kJ/kg (latent heat of vaporization of water at 1 atm and 100°C)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nQ = 1 kg × 2260 kJ/kg = 2260 kJ\n\nSo, it requires 2260 kJ of energy to vaporize 1 kg of water at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 100°C."
