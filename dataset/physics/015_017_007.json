    "message_2": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a space-based gravitational wave observatory designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves in the range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) Hz. Gravitational waves from the cosmic inflationary epoch are expected to be in the very low-frequency range, which is challenging for LISA to detect directly.\n\nThe anticipated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of gravitational waves from the cosmic inflationary epoch using LISA depends on the specific model of inflation and the energy scale of inflation. In general, the SNR is expected to be low, making it difficult for LISA to directly detect these primordial gravitational waves.\n\nTo achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5, the duration of the cosmic inflationary epoch would need to be long enough to produce a significant amount of gravitational waves at the frequencies detectable by LISA. The duration of inflation is typically characterized by the number of e-folds, which is a measure of the expansion of the universe during inflation. A larger number of e-folds corresponds to a longer duration of inflation.\n\nThe exact minimum duration of the cosmic inflationary epoch necessary for a detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5 depends on the specific model of inflation and the energy scale of inflation. However, it is generally believed that a minimum of around 60 e-folds is required for the observable universe to solve the horizon and flatness problems, which are some of the main motivations for the inflationary theory.\n\nIn summary, while the anticipated signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of gravitational waves from the cosmic inflationary epoch using LISA is generally low, a longer duration of inflation (e.g., at least 60 e-folds) might increase the chances of detection. However, the exact minimum duration necessary for a detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5 depends on the specific model of inflation and the energy scale of inflation."
