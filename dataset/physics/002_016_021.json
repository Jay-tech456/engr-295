    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of a gas, we can use the Van der Waals equation and the critical constants. The critical constants are related to the Van der Waals constants as follows:\n\nCritical pressure (Pc) = a / (27 * b^2)\nCritical temperature (Tc) = (8 * a) / (27 * b * R)\n\nWhere R is the ideal gas constant, which is approximately 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K.\n\nWe are given the critical pressure (Pc) as 56.7 atm, and the Van der Waals constants a and b as 3.59 L^2*atm/mol^2 and 0.0427 L/mol, respectively. We can use the equation for critical pressure to find the value of the constant R:\n\n56.7 atm = 3.59 L^2*atm/mol^2 / (27 * (0.0427 L/mol)^2)\n\nNow, we can solve for R:\n\nR = (3.59 L^2*atm/mol^2) / (56.7 atm * 27 * (0.0427 L/mol)^2) ≈ 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K\n\nNow that we have the value of R, we can use the equation for critical temperature to find the critical temperature (Tc):\n\nTc = (8 * a) / (27 * b * R)\nTc = (8 * 3.59 L^2*atm/mol^2) / (27 * 0.0427 L/mol * 0.0821 L*atm/mol*K)\n\nTc ≈ 132.48 K\n\nTherefore, the critical temperature of the gas is approximately 132.48 K."
