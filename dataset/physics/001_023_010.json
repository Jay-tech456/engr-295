    "message_2": "In quantum cosmology, the cosmic inflation period refers to the rapid expansion of the universe that occurred shortly after the Big Bang. This period is believed to have lasted from 10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds after the Big Bang. During this time, the universe expanded at an exponential rate, and its temperature decreased significantly.\n\nTo estimate the minimum temperature during the cosmic inflation period, we can use the concept of the Gibbons-Hawking temperature, which is associated with the event horizon of a de Sitter space. The de Sitter space is a model of the universe during the inflation period, characterized by a positive cosmological constant and exponential expansion.\n\nThe Gibbons-Hawking temperature (T_GH) is given by the following equation:\n\nT_GH = (ħ * H) / (2 * π * k_B * c)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, H is the Hubble parameter during inflation, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Hubble parameter during inflation (H) can be estimated using the energy scale of inflation (V^1/4), where V is the potential energy density of the inflaton field. The energy scale of inflation is typically around 10^16 GeV. To convert this to the Hubble parameter, we can use the following relation:\n\nH ≈ (8 * π * G * V^1/4) / (3 * c^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nPlugging in the values for the constants and the energy scale of inflation, we get:\n\nH ≈ (8 * π * (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (10^16 * 10^9 eV)^1/4) / (3 * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nH ≈ 2.3 * 10^13 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbons-Hawking temperature:\n\nT_GH ≈ ((1.054 * 10^-34 Js) * (2.3 * 10^13 Hz)) / (2 * π * (1.381 * 10^-23 J/K) * (3 * 10^8 m/s))\n\nT_GH ≈ 1.3 * 10^11 K\n\nSo, the minimum temperature of the universe during the cosmic inflation period, according to the theory of quantum cosmology, is approximately 1.3 * 10^11 Kelvin. This temperature is significantly lower than the temperature at the end of the inflation period, which is estimated to be around 10^27 K."
