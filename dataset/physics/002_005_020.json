    "message_2": "To calculate the overall change in entropy, we need to consider both the entropy change of the system and the entropy change of the surroundings.\n\nFor an isothermal process, the change in entropy of the system (ΔS_system) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔS_system = Q/T\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed by the system and T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin. Since the system releases 1000 J of heat to its surroundings, it means that the system absorbs -1000 J of heat (Q = -1000 J).\n\nNow, let's calculate the entropy change of the surroundings (ΔS_surroundings). The surroundings absorb the 1000 J of heat released by the system, so the heat absorbed by the surroundings is Q_surroundings = 1000 J.\n\nΔS_surroundings = Q_surroundings/T_surroundings\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature of the surroundings is the same as the temperature of the system (T_surroundings = T). Therefore,\n\nΔS_surroundings = 1000 J/T\n\nThe overall change in entropy (ΔS_total) is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and the surroundings:\n\nΔS_total = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings\nΔS_total = (-1000 J/T) + (1000 J/T)\n\nΔS_total = 0 J/K\n\nSo, the overall change in entropy for this isothermal gas expansion process is 0 J/K."
