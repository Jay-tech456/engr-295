    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino oscillating from one flavor to another, we need to consider the neutrino mixing angles and mass-squared differences. The probability of oscillation can be expressed as:\n\nP(νe → νx) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere P(νe → νx) is the probability of an electron neutrino (νe) oscillating into another flavor (νx), θ is the mixing angle, Δm² is the mass-squared difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates, L is the distance traveled by the neutrino, and E is the energy of the neutrino.\n\nThere are three neutrino flavors and three mass eigenstates, so there are multiple oscillation channels to consider. For simplicity, we will consider the two main oscillation channels: νe → νμ and νe → ντ.\n\nFor the νe → νμ channel, we use the mixing angle θ12 and the mass-squared difference Δm²21. The current best-fit values for these parameters are:\n\nθ12 ≈ 33.82°\nΔm²21 ≈ 7.39 × 10⁻⁵ eV²\n\nFor the νe → ντ channel, we use the mixing angle θ13 and the mass-squared difference Δm²31. The current best-fit values for these parameters are:\n\nθ13 ≈ 8.61°\nΔm²31 ≈ 2.523 × 10⁻³ eV²\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities for each channel:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2 * 33.82°) * sin²(1.27 * 7.39 × 10⁻⁵ eV² * 500 m / 1 GeV)\nP(νe → νμ) ≈ 0.846 * sin²(0.0185)\nP(νe → νμ) ≈ 0.846 * 0.000342\nP(νe → νμ) ≈ 0.000289\n\nP(νe → ντ) = sin²(2 * 8.61°) * sin²(1.27 * 2.523 × 10⁻³ eV² * 500 m / 1 GeV)\nP(νe → ντ) ≈ 0.0265 * sin²(1.59)\nP(νe → ντ) ≈ 0.0265 * 0.999\nP(νe → ντ) ≈ 0.0265\n\nThe total probability of an electron neutrino oscillating into another flavor after traveling 500 meters with an energy of 1 GeV is the sum of the probabilities for each channel:\n\nP(νe → νx) = P(νe → νμ) + P(νe → ντ)\nP(νe → νx) ≈ 0.000289 + 0.0265\nP(νe → νx) ≈ 0.0268\n\nSo, the probability of a neutrino oscillating from an electron neutrino to another flavor after traveling 500 meters in a vacuum with an energy of 1 GeV is approximately 2.68%."
