    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section is a measure of the probability of an electron scattering off a target, such as a helium atom, due to the interaction between the electron and the target's nucleus. In the case of helium, the nucleus has a charge of +2e, where e is the elementary charge. The Mott scattering cross section formula is given by:\n\nσ_Mott = (Z^2 * e^4) / (4 * π * ε_0^2 * E^2 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- σ_Mott is the Mott scattering cross section\n- Z is the atomic number of the target (Z = 2 for helium)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n- ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C^2/Nm^2)\n- E is the energy of the incident electron\n- θ is the scattering angle\n\nTo calculate the Mott scattering cross section for a helium atom bombarded with electrons of a certain energy, we need to know the energy of the incident electrons (E) and the scattering angle (θ). Since these values are not provided, I will use a general expression for the cross section.\n\nσ_Mott = (2^2 * (1.602 x 10^-19)^4) / (4 * π * (8.854 x 10^-12)^2 * E^2 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nσ_Mott = (1.44 x 10^-28) / (E^2 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nThe physical significance of the Mott scattering cross section in atomic physics is that it provides a measure of the probability of an electron scattering off a helium nucleus due to the electrostatic interaction between the electron and the nucleus. This scattering process is important in understanding the behavior of electrons in the presence of atomic nuclei and can be used to study the structure of atoms and molecules. The Mott scattering cross section is also useful in the development of electron scattering experiments and the interpretation of their results."
