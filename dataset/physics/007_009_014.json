Given that the diffusion coefficient of UF6 in He is 0.202 cm²/s, and assuming the gas mixture behaves as an ideal gas.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the gas diffusion process, we can use the formula for the separation factor (α) in a gas diffusion process:\n\nα = (D₁/D₂)^(1/2)\n\nwhere D₁ is the diffusion coefficient of the lighter isotope (U-235) and D₂ is the diffusion coefficient of the heavier isotope (U-238). Since the problem states that the diffusion coefficient of UF6 in He is 0.202 cm²/s, we can assume that this value represents the average diffusion coefficient for both isotopes. \n\nNow, we need to find the diffusion coefficients for the individual isotopes. The Graham's law of diffusion states that the diffusion rate of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass:\n\nD ∝ 1/√M\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient and M is the molar mass. For UF6, the molar mass of U-235 is 235 g/mol and the molar mass of U-238 is 238 g/mol. The molar mass of F is 19 g/mol, so the molar mass of UF6 containing U-235 is 349 g/mol and the molar mass of UF6 containing U-238 is 352 g/mol.\n\nUsing the average diffusion coefficient (0.202 cm²/s) and the molar masses, we can find the individual diffusion coefficients:\n\nD₁ = 0.202 cm²/s * (352/349)^(1/2) ≈ 0.204 cm²/s (for U-235)\nD₂ = 0.202 cm²/s * (349/352)^(1/2) ≈ 0.200 cm²/s (for U-238)\n\nNow, we can calculate the separation factor (α):\n\nα = (0.204/0.200)^(1/2) ≈ 1.010\n\nThe efficiency of the gas diffusion process can be expressed as the percentage increase in the concentration of the lighter isotope (U-235) compared to the initial concentration:\n\nEfficiency = (α - 1) * 100% ≈ (1.010 - 1) * 100% ≈ 1%\n\nSo, the efficiency of the gas diffusion process used for uranium enrichment in this case is approximately 1%."
