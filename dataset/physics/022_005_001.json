    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the motion of galaxies and the bending of light from distant objects.\n\nThe role of dark matter in the formation and growth of black holes is not yet fully understood, but it is thought to play a significant role in several ways:\n\n1. Dark matter halos: Dark matter is believed to form large-scale structures called halos, which act as gravitational wells that attract visible matter, such as gas and stars. These halos can serve as the \"seeds\" for the formation of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. As the visible matter falls into the dark matter halo, it can accumulate in the center and eventually form a black hole.\n\n2. Dark matter accretion: Just like visible matter, dark matter can also be accreted by black holes. However, since dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, it does not emit light or radiation when it falls into a black hole. This makes the accretion of dark matter by black holes difficult to observe directly. Nevertheless, the gravitational influence of dark matter can contribute to the growth of black holes over time.\n\n3. Gravitational interactions: Dark matter can also influence the growth of black holes through gravitational interactions. For example, the presence of dark matter can affect the dynamics of galaxy mergers, which can lead to the merging of the central black holes and the formation of larger black holes.\n\nDespite these potential roles, the exact interaction between dark matter and black holes remains an open question in astrophysics. One of the challenges in understanding this interaction is the lack of direct observational evidence for dark matter. Current research is focused on developing new techniques to detect dark matter and studying its properties, which will help to shed light on its role in the formation and growth of black holes."
