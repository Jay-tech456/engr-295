    "message_1": "A current-carrying motor consisting of a rectangular wire loop with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. If the current flowing through the wire loop is 4 A, what is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force acting on the wire loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic force acting on the wire loop, we need to consider the force acting on each side of the loop separately and then combine them to find the net force.\n\nThe magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = B * I * L * sin(θ)\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, B is the magnetic field, I is the current, L is the length of the wire, and θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field.\n\nFor the top and bottom sides of the loop (length 5 cm), the current is parallel to the magnetic field, so the angle θ is 0 degrees. Therefore, the magnetic force on these sides is:\n\nF_top_bottom = B * I * L * sin(0) = 0\n\nFor the left and right sides of the loop (width 3 cm), the current is perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the angle θ is 90 degrees. Therefore, the magnetic force on these sides is:\n\nF_left_right = B * I * L * sin(90) = B * I * L\n\nFor the left side, the magnetic force is:\n\nF_left = 0.5 T * 4 A * 0.03 m = 0.06 N (upward direction)\n\nFor the right side, the magnetic force is:\n\nF_right = 0.5 T * 4 A * 0.03 m = 0.06 N (downward direction)\n\nSince the magnetic forces on the left and right sides are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net magnetic force of 0 N on the wire loop."
