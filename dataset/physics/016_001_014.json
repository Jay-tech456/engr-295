    "message_2": "The high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) is a well-known cuprate superconductor with a critical temperature (Tc) that depends on the oxygen content (x) in the material. The critical temperature is the temperature below which the material exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism.\n\nFor YBCO, the optimal oxygen content (x) is approximately 0.15, which corresponds to the highest critical temperature. The critical temperature for YBa2Cu3O7-0.15 is around 92 K (-181 °C or -294 °F). This is considered high for a superconductor, as most conventional superconductors have critical temperatures below 30 K.\n\nAs the oxygen content (x) deviates from the optimal value, the critical temperature (Tc) decreases. When there is more oxygen (x < 0.15), the material becomes overdoped, and when there is less oxygen (x > 0.15), the material becomes underdoped. In both cases, the superconducting properties of the material are diminished.\n\nIn general, the relationship between the critical temperature (Tc) and oxygen content (x) in YBCO is complex and depends on factors such as the crystal structure, defects, and impurities. However, it is well-established that the highest Tc occurs at an optimal oxygen content, and deviations from this value result in lower critical temperatures."
