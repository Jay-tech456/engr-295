    "message_1": "\" A laser beam with a wavelength of 633 nm passes through a narrow slit of width 0.1 mm. What is the angle of the first and the second minima observed on a screen 2 meters away from the slit?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the minima, m is the order of the minima (m = 1 for the first minima, m = 2 for the second minima), λ is the wavelength of the laser beam, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\nSlit width (a) = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\nScreen distance = 2 m (already in meters)\n\nNow, we can find the angles for the first and second minima:\n\n1. First minima (m = 1):\nsin(θ1) = (1 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ1) = 6.33 * 10^(-6)\n\nθ1 = arcsin(6.33 * 10^(-6))\nθ1 ≈ 3.62 * 10^(-4) radians\n\nTo convert to degrees:\nθ1 ≈ (3.62 * 10^(-4) * 180) / π\nθ1 ≈ 0.0207 degrees\n\n2. Second minima (m = 2):\nsin(θ2) = (2 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ2) = 12.66 * 10^(-6)\n\nθ2 = arcsin(12.66 * 10^(-6))\nθ2 ≈ 7.24 * 10^(-4) radians\n\nTo convert to degrees:\nθ2 ≈ (7.24 * 10^(-4) * 180) / π\nθ2 ≈ 0.0415 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of the first minima is approximately 0.0207 degrees, and the angle of the second minima is approximately 0.0415 degrees."
