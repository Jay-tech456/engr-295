    "message_2": "Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. It can be explained within the framework of General Relativity through the introduction of a cosmological constant (denoted by Λ) in Einstein's field equations. The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum, which acts as a repulsive force causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.\n\nEinstein's field equations with the cosmological constant are given by:\n\nGμν + Λgμν = 8πGTμν\n\nHere, Gμν is the Einstein tensor, gμν is the metric tensor, Tμν is the stress-energy tensor, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe observational evidence for dark energy comes from several independent sources:\n\n1. Supernovae Type Ia observations: In the late 1990s, two independent teams of astronomers observed distant Type Ia supernovae, which are used as \"standard candles\" to measure cosmic distances. They found that these supernovae were dimmer than expected, indicating that they were farther away than predicted by the standard cosmological model. This suggested that the expansion of the universe was accelerating, which could be explained by the presence of dark energy.\n\n2. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB, particularly by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite, have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark energy. The data show that the universe is flat, and the observed density of matter (both ordinary and dark matter) is not enough to account for this flatness. The presence of dark energy can explain the observed flatness of the universe.\n\n3. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO): BAO are fluctuations in the density of visible baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) in the early universe. These fluctuations left an imprint on the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the universe. Observations of the BAO scale provide a \"standard ruler\" for measuring cosmic distances and have been used to confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe, providing further evidence for dark energy.\n\n4. Large scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe also provides evidence for dark energy. The observed large-scale structure of the universe can be explained by the influence of dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures over time.\n\nIn summary, dark energy can be incorporated into the framework of General Relativity through the cosmological constant, and its existence is supported by multiple lines of observational evidence, including Type Ia supernovae, CMB radiation, BAO, and the large-scale structure of the universe."
