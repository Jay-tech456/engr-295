    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 10 cm = 0.1 m and the current I = 2 A, we can now calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 4π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current is approximately 4π × 10^(-6) T or 12.57 × 10^(-6) T (12.57 µT)."
