    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 8 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (8 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 8 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (32π × 10^-7 Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 3.2 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 3.2 × 10^-5 T (Tesla).\n\nNow, for the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, since the problem doesn't specify the orientation of the wire, we can only say that the magnetic field will be in a circular pattern around the wire, perpendicular to the wire's direction."
