    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 10 cm from a current-carrying inductor, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field intensity at a distance (r) from the wire can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with an inductor with a radius of 5 cm, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field intensity at a distance (r) from a current-carrying loop with radius R:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere\nμ₀ = permeability of free space = 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A\nI = current = 2 A\nR = radius of the inductor = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nr = distance from the inductor = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field intensity:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T·m * 0.0025 m²) / (2 * (0.0025 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\nB ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-6) T / (2 * 0.0559 m)\nB ≈ 6.283 × 10^(-6) T / 0.1118 m\nB ≈ 5.62 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 10 cm from the current-carrying inductor is approximately 5.62 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
