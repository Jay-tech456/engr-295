The strange attractor is a set of points in the $x-y$ plane that the system tends to evolve towards, even though the system's behavior is chaotic and sensitive to initial conditions.\n\nIn the context of chaos theory, the strange attractor represents the long-term behavior of a chaotic system. It is called \"strange\" because it has a fractal structure, meaning it has detail at all scales and is not easily described by traditional geometry. The existence of a strange attractor in a dynamical system is an indication of chaotic behavior, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. This makes long-term prediction of the system's behavior difficult, but the strange attractor can still provide insights into the overall structure and patterns of the system."
