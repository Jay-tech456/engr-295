    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the rectangular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a rectangular loop at a point on its axis:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a * b²) / (2 * π * (a² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current in the loop (2 A)\na is the length of the loop (4 cm = 0.04 m)\nb is the width of the loop (6 cm = 0.06 m)\nz is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis (8 cm = 0.08 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.04 m * 0.06² m²) / (2 * π * (0.04² m² + 0.08² m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.04 m * 0.0036 m²) / ((0.0064 m² + 0.0064 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2.88 × 10^(-7) Tm²) / (0.0128 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB ≈ 2.88 × 10^(-7) Tm² / 0.04525 m³\n\nB ≈ 6.36 × 10^(-9) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, located 8 cm from the center of the loop, is approximately 6.36 × 10^(-9) T (Tesla)."
