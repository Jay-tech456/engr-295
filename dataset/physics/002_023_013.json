    "message_2": "To determine the vapor pressure of water at 80°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given:\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol\nP1 = 101.3 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure)\nT1 = 373.15 K (boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure)\nT2 = 80°C = 353.15 K\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure of water at 80°C. Rearranging the equation to solve for P2, we get:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(-40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (1/353.15 K - 1/373.15 K))\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(-40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (-0.0000536 K^(-1)))\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(0.273)\n\nP2 ≈ 101.3 kPa * 1.314\n\nP2 ≈ 133.1 kPa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at 80°C is approximately 133.1 kPa."
