    "message_2": "To calculate the expected recoil energy and detection rate of dark matter particles in a Germanium (Ge) target, we need to consider several factors, including the dark matter particle mass, the cross-section value, and the properties of the Germanium target. In the framework of the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction model, the differential event rate can be expressed as:\n\ndR/dE_R = (ρ_χ / m_χ) * (σ_n / m_n) * A^2 * F^2(E_R) * R(E_R)\n\nwhere:\n- dR/dE_R is the differential event rate as a function of the recoil energy E_R\n- ρ_χ is the local dark matter density\n- m_χ is the dark matter particle mass\n- σ_n is the WIMP-nucleon cross-section value\n- m_n is the nucleon mass\n- A is the atomic mass number of the target nucleus (Ge in this case)\n- F(E_R) is the nuclear form factor, which accounts for the loss of coherence in the scattering process at higher momentum transfers\n- R(E_R) is the detector response function, which depends on the detector's energy resolution and efficiency\n\nTo find the expected recoil energy, we need to solve the above equation for E_R. However, this requires knowledge of the specific experimental setup, including the detector response function R(E_R) and the nuclear form factor F(E_R).\n\nFor the detection rate, we can integrate the differential event rate over the energy range of interest:\n\nR = ∫(dR/dE_R) dE_R\n\nAgain, this requires knowledge of the specific experimental setup and the energy range of interest.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the expected recoil energy and detection rate of dark matter particles in a Germanium target for a given cross-section value and dark matter particle mass in the framework of the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction model, we need to know the specific experimental setup and the energy range of interest. With this information, we can solve the differential event rate equation for the recoil energy and integrate it over the energy range to find the detection rate."
