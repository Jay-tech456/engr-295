    "message_2": "The frequency range and duration of gravitational waves emitted by merging neutron stars depend on several factors, including the masses of the neutron stars, their distance from each other, and the details of their inspiral and merger process. However, we can provide a rough estimate based on some general assumptions.\n\n1. Masses of neutron stars: Neutron stars typically have masses between 1.1 and 2.4 solar masses (M☉). Let's consider two neutron stars with masses M1 = 1.4 M☉ and M2 = 1.4 M☉ for simplicity.\n\n2. Orbital frequency: The frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system. The orbital frequency (f_orb) can be related to the masses and the separation (a) of the neutron stars using Kepler's third law:\n\n(2 * pi * f_orb)^2 * a^3 = G * (M1 + M2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. \n\n3. Separation of neutron stars: As the neutron stars inspiral, their separation decreases. The minimum separation occurs when they touch, which is roughly the sum of their radii. Neutron stars have radii of about 10 km, so the minimum separation is a_min ≈ 20 km.\n\n4. Maximum orbital frequency: Using the minimum separation, we can find the maximum orbital frequency (f_orb_max) just before the merger:\n\n(2 * pi * f_orb_max)^2 * a_min^3 = G * (M1 + M2)\n\nSolving for f_orb_max, we get:\n\nf_orb_max ≈ 1570 Hz\n\nSo, the maximum frequency of gravitational waves (f_max) is twice the maximum orbital frequency:\n\nf_max ≈ 3140 Hz\n\n5. Duration of the gravitational wave signal: The duration depends on the initial separation of the neutron stars and the rate at which they lose energy due to gravitational wave emission. A rough estimate for the duration can be obtained from the chirp mass (M_c) of the system:\n\nM_c = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nFor our example with M1 = M2 = 1.4 M☉, we get M_c ≈ 1.2 M☉.\n\nThe duration (t) of the gravitational wave signal can be estimated using the chirp mass and the initial frequency (f_initial) of the gravitational waves:\n\nt ≈ 5 / (256 * pi^(8/3) * G^(5/3) * M_c^(5/3) * f_initial^(8/3))\n\nAssuming an initial frequency of 10 Hz, we get:\n\nt ≈ 1.6 x 10^5 seconds ≈ 44 hours\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by merging neutron stars is roughly up to 3140 Hz, and the duration of the signal can be on the order of tens of hours, depending on the initial separation and other factors. Note that these are rough estimates and can vary significantly depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbit."
