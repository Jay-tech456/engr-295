    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive isotope has an initial activity of 800 Becquerels. If the half-life of the isotope is 5 days, what will be the activity after 15 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere Activity_final is the activity after the time elapsed, Activity_initial is the initial activity, time_elapsed is the time that has passed, and half_life is the half-life of the isotope.\n\nGiven the initial activity (Activity_initial) is 800 Becquerels, the half-life (half_life) is 5 days, and the time elapsed (time_elapsed) is 15 days, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nActivity_final = 800 * (1/2)^(15 / 5)\n\nActivity_final = 800 * (1/2)^3\n\nActivity_final = 800 * (1/8)\n\nActivity_final = 100 Becquerels\n\nSo, the activity of the radioactive isotope after 15 days will be 100 Becquerels."
