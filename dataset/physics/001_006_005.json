    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the relationship between the width of the slits (a), the spacing between the slits (d), the wavelength of the light (λ), the distance between the screen and the slits (L), and the spacing between the interference fringes (Δy) can be described using the formula for the angular position of the interference maxima (bright fringes):\n\nsin(θ) ≈ (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th maximum, and m is an integer representing the order of the fringe (m = 0 for the central maximum, m = ±1 for the first-order maxima, m = ±2 for the second-order maxima, and so on).\n\nTo find the relationship between the width of the slits (a) and the spacing between the interference fringes (Δy), we can use the small-angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ ≈ (Δy) / L\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n(Δy) / L ≈ (m * λ) / d\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Δy, we get:\n\nΔy ≈ (m * λ * L) / d\n\nThis equation describes the relationship between the spacing between the interference fringes (Δy) and the other parameters of the double-slit experiment. Note that the width of the slits (a) does not directly affect the spacing between the interference fringes. However, the width of the slits (a) does affect the intensity and visibility of the fringes, with narrower slits generally producing more pronounced and well-defined fringes."
