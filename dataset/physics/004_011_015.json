    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström black hole is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, which describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The electrical potential energy of a charged particle placed at a fixed distance outside of a Reissner-Nordström black hole can be calculated using the formula for the electrostatic potential energy:\n\nU = k * (q1 * q2) / r\n\nwhere:\n- U is the electrical potential energy\n- k is the electrostatic constant, approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2\n- q1 is the charge of the black hole\n- q2 is the charge of the particle\n- r is the distance between the black hole and the particle\n\nHowever, this formula is derived from classical electrostatics and may not be entirely accurate in the context of a Reissner-Nordström black hole, where general relativity and strong gravitational fields come into play. To obtain a more accurate result, one would need to consider the full general relativistic treatment of the problem, which involves solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations for the given mass and charge parameters of the black hole and the charged particle."
