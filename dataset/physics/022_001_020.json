    "message_2": "There are several proposed candidates for dark matter particles, with varying degrees of experimental evidence supporting each. Some of the main candidates include:\n\n1. WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact through the weak nuclear force and gravity. They are considered one of the leading candidates for dark matter due to their predicted properties aligning well with the observed behavior of dark matter. Experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and direct detection experiments such as XENON1T and LUX are searching for WIMPs, but so far, no definitive evidence has been found.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are light, neutral, and weakly interacting, making them a suitable candidate for dark matter. The Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) and other similar experiments are searching for axions, but no direct detection has been made yet.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through any of the known fundamental forces except gravity. They are an extension of the Standard Model's neutrino sector and could be a dark matter candidate. Experiments like IceCube and MiniBooNE are searching for sterile neutrinos, but no conclusive evidence has been found so far.\n\n4. Primordial black holes: Primordial black holes are small black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could potentially account for some or all of the dark matter. Observations of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo, as well as microlensing surveys, are used to constrain the abundance of primordial black holes, but their role in dark matter remains uncertain.\n\nThere is no definitive leading candidate for dark matter particles at this moment, as experimental evidence has not yet confirmed any of the proposed candidates. The search for dark matter particles continues, and future experiments and observations may provide more insight into the nature of dark matter."
