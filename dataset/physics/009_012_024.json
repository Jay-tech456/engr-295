    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/v\n\n50 / 600 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can find v:\n\nv = 600 / 50\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 12 cm.\n\nNext, we'll find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -12/30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification of the object produced by the lens is -0.4. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
