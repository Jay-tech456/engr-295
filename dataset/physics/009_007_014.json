    "message_1": "A concave lens has a focal length of -10 cm. If an object is placed 20 cm in front of the lens, what is the image distance and magnification?",
    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = -10 cm and object distance u = 20 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/(-10) - 1/20\n1/v = -1/20\n\nv = -20 cm\n\nThe image distance is -20 cm, which means the image is formed 20 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, to find the magnification, we can use the formula:\n\nmagnification = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nmagnification = -(-20)/20\nmagnification = 1\n\nThe magnification is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object."
