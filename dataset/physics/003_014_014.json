    "message_1": "A rectangular wire loop with dimensions 4 cm x 8 cm carries a current of 6 A in the clockwise direction. Find the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can add up the magnetic fields due to each segment to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the four corners of the rectangle as A, B, C, and D, with A and B being the shorter sides (4 cm) and B and C being the longer sides (8 cm). The magnetic field at the center due to each segment will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop.\n\nFor segments AB and CD (the shorter sides), the magnetic field at the center will be in the same direction and will add up. For segments BC and DA (the longer sides), the magnetic field at the center will be in opposite directions and will cancel each other out.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field due to segment AB at the center:\n\ndB_AB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl_AB * sinθ) / r²\n\nwhere dl_AB is the length of segment AB (0.04 m), θ is the angle between the position vector and the current element (90° for the center), and r is the distance from the center to the midpoint of segment AB (0.04 m).\n\ndB_AB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (6 A * 0.04 m * sin(90°)) / (0.04 m)²\ndB_AB = 3 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to segment CD is the same as that due to segment AB, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 2 * dB_AB = 2 * 3 × 10⁻⁶ T = 6 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 6 × 10⁻⁶ T."
