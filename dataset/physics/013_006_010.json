    "message_2": "The velocity of a shockwave generated by the explosion of a Type Ia supernova can vary depending on several factors, such as the energy of the explosion and the density of the interstellar medium. However, typical velocities for such shockwaves are in the range of 3,000 to 30,000 kilometers per second (km/s). These velocities can change over time as the shockwave interacts with the surrounding medium and loses energy."
