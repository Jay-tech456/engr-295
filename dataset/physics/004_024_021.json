    "message_2": "To calculate the expected gravitational wave emission from a cosmic string, we need to consider the energy carried away by the gravitational waves. The power emitted by a cosmic string in the form of gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nP = (Gμ^2) / (c^5) * (L * v^4)\n\nwhere P is the power emitted, G is the gravitational constant, μ is the linear mass density of the string, c is the speed of light, L is the length of the string, and v is the velocity of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the cosmic string:\n\nμ = mass / length = (10^24 kg) / (10^16 m) = 10^8 kg/m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP = (Gμ^2) / (c^5) * (L * v^4)\n\nUsing the following constants:\nG = 6.674 × 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)\nc = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s\n\nP = ((6.674 × 10^(-11)) * (10^8)^2) / ((2.998 × 10^8)^5) * (10^16 * (0.75 * 2.998 × 10^8)^4)\n\nP ≈ 1.42 × 10^25 Watts\n\nSo, the expected gravitational wave emission from the cosmic string is approximately 1.42 × 10^25 Watts. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and more accurate calculations would require a deeper understanding of the cosmic string's properties and the surrounding environment."
