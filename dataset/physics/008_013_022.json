    "message_2": "The tau lepton, also known as the tau particle or simply tau (τ), is a subatomic particle with a mass of approximately 1.77686 GeV/c² (giga-electronvolts divided by the speed of light squared), which is equivalent to around 3.167 × 10^(-27) kg.\n\nTo compare the mass of the tau lepton to other subatomic particles, let's consider some of the most well-known particles:\n\n1. Electron: The electron has a mass of approximately 0.511 MeV/c² (mega-electronvolts divided by the speed of light squared), or about 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg. The tau lepton is roughly 3470 times more massive than the electron.\n\n2. Muon: The muon is another type of lepton, with a mass of approximately 105.7 MeV/c², or about 1.883 × 10^(-28) kg. The tau lepton is around 16.8 times more massive than the muon.\n\n3. Proton: The proton has a mass of approximately 938.3 MeV/c², or about 1.673 × 10^(-27) kg. The tau lepton is slightly less massive than the proton, with a mass ratio of about 0.95.\n\n4. Neutron: The neutron has a mass of approximately 939.6 MeV/c², or about 1.675 × 10^(-27) kg. Similar to the proton, the tau lepton is slightly less massive than the neutron, with a mass ratio of about 0.94.\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton is significantly more massive than both the electron and muon, but slightly less massive than the proton and neutron."
