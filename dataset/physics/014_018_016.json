    "message_2": "The maximum galactic cosmic ray (GCR) dose to which an astronaut may be exposed during a long-duration spaceflight depends on various factors such as the duration of the mission, solar activity, and shielding provided by the spacecraft. On average, astronauts in deep space missions can be exposed to GCR doses of about 0.3 to 0.6 Sieverts (Sv) per year. However, during solar minimum conditions, the dose can be as high as 0.7 to 1.2 Sv per year.\n\nThe potential health risks associated with this level of radiation exposure include both short-term and long-term effects. Short-term effects, also known as acute radiation syndrome, can occur at doses above 1 Sv and may include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and skin burns. Long-term effects are mainly associated with an increased risk of cancer due to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The lifetime risk of cancer mortality increases by about 5% per Sievert of radiation exposure.\n\nAdditionally, GCR exposure can lead to other long-term health risks such as cataracts, cardiovascular diseases, and damage to the central nervous system. The central nervous system damage may result in cognitive impairments, mood disorders, and other neurological complications.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, spacecraft designers and mission planners aim to minimize radiation exposure through shielding, mission planning, and monitoring of solar activity. Astronauts are also trained to respond to solar particle events and other radiation hazards during their missions."
