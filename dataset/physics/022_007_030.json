    "message_2": "The theoretical background of dark matter originates from the observation that the visible matter in the universe is insufficient to account for the gravitational effects observed in large-scale structures, such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing. This led to the hypothesis of the existence of dark matter, which is believed to be composed of non-luminous, non-baryonic particles that interact primarily through gravity and possibly via weak interactions.\n\nOne of the leading candidates for dark matter particles is Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are hypothesized to have masses in the range of 10 to 1000 GeV/cÂ² and interact weakly with ordinary matter. Other candidates include axions and sterile neutrinos, which have different mass ranges and interaction properties.\n\nThe direct detection of dark matter particles involves searching for their interactions with ordinary matter in highly sensitive detectors. The basic principle is that a dark matter particle, such as a WIMP, would occasionally collide with a nucleus in the detector, causing it to recoil and deposit a small amount of energy. This energy deposition can be detected through various methods, such as ionization, scintillation, or phonon production.\n\nThere are several experimental techniques currently employed for direct dark matter detection:\n\n1. Cryogenic detectors: These detectors use ultra-cold materials, such as germanium or silicon crystals, to detect the phonons produced by the recoiling nucleus. Examples include the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) and the EDELWEISS experiment.\n\n2. Liquid noble gas detectors: These detectors use liquefied noble gases, such as xenon or argon, to detect both ionization and scintillation signals produced by the recoiling nucleus. Examples include the XENON, LUX, and DarkSide experiments.\n\n3. Crystal scintillators: These detectors use inorganic crystals that emit light (scintillate) when struck by a recoiling nucleus. Examples include the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, which claims to have observed an annual modulation signal consistent with dark matter interactions.\n\n4. Axion detectors: These detectors search for axions by looking for their conversion into photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is a prominent example.\n\nThe effectiveness of current detection methods is limited by several factors, such as background noise from cosmic rays, radioactive decays, and other interactions that can mimic dark matter signals. To overcome these challenges, experiments are conducted deep underground and use various shielding and veto techniques to reduce background events.\n\nDespite significant advancements in detector technology and sensitivity, no experiment has provided conclusive evidence for the direct detection of dark matter particles. However, the search continues, and future experiments with even greater sensitivity and new detection techniques may finally reveal the elusive nature of dark matter."
