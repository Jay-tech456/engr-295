    "message_2": "To reduce the intensity of gamma rays by 90%, we want to find the thickness of lead that allows only 10% of the initial intensity to pass through. In this case, the initial intensity (I₀) is 50,000 counts per minute, and we want to find the thickness (x) that results in a final intensity (I) of 5,000 counts per minute (10% of 50,000).\n\nThe formula for the intensity of gamma rays after passing through a material is:\n\nI = I₀ * (1/2)^(x / t)\n\nwhere I is the final intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, x is the thickness of the material, and t is the half-thickness of the material.\n\nWe can plug in the values and solve for x:\n\n5,000 = 50,000 * (1/2)^(x / 1)\n\nDivide both sides by 50,000:\n\n0.1 = (1/2)^(x / 1)\n\nTo solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.1) = log((1/2)^x)\n\nSince log(a^b) = b * log(a), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog(0.1) = x * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = log(0.1) / log(1/2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 3.32 cm\n\nSo, a thickness of approximately 3.32 cm of lead is required to reduce the intensity of gamma rays by 90%."
