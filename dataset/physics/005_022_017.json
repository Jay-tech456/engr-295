    "message_1": "A physics student is observing a charged particle moving at a relativistic speed of 0.8c. They want to know the strength of the magnetic force acting on the particle due to the electric field of a stationary charged particle located at a distance of 1 meter. If the stationary particle has a charge of +2 micro-Coulombs and the relativistic particle has a charge of -4 micro-Coulombs, what is the magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the relativistic particle?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic force acting on the relativistic particle, we can use the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF = q * (E + v × B)\n\nwhere F is the force, q is the charge of the moving particle, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the moving particle, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, we need to find the electric field E created by the stationary charged particle. We can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge:\n\nE = k * Q / r^2\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge of the stationary particle, and r is the distance between the particles. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (2 × 10^-6 C) / (1 m)^2\nE = 17.98 N/C\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field B created by the moving charged particle. We can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a moving point charge:\n\nB = μ₀ * q * v / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 T m/A), q is the charge of the moving particle, v is its velocity, and r is the distance between the particles. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 T m/A) * (-4 × 10^-6 C) * (0.8 * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (4 * π * (1 m)^2)\nB = -3.2 × 10^-7 T\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic force F using the Lorentz force equation. Since the electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other, the cross product v × B will have a magnitude of |v| * |B|. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\nF = q * (E + |v| * |B|)\nF = (-4 × 10^-6 C) * (17.98 N/C + (0.8 * 3 × 10^8 m/s) * (3.2 × 10^-7 T))\nF = -4 × 10^-6 C * (17.98 N/C + 7.68 × 10^-7 N/C)\nF = -4 × 10^-6 C * 18.65768 N/C\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the relativistic particle is:\n\n|F| = 7.463072 × 10^-5 N"
