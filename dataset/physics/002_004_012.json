    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) in the combustion of 1 mole of ethane, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_combustion = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane is:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction:\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × ΔH_f(CO2) + 3 × ΔH_f(H2O)] - [ΔH_f(C2H6) + 7/2 × ΔH_f(O2)]\n\nSince the enthalpy of formation of O2 is zero (it is in its standard state), the equation becomes:\n\nΔH_combustion = [2 × (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 3 × (-241.8 kJ/mol)] - [(-84.68 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = [-787 kJ/mol + (-725.4 kJ/mol)] - [(-84.68 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_combustion = -1512.4 kJ/mol + 84.68 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_combustion = -1427.72 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change in the combustion of 1 mole of ethane at standard conditions is approximately -1427.72 kJ/mol."
