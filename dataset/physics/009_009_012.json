    "message_2": "To find the position and size of the image formed by a concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, focal length (f) = -15 cm (concave mirror has a negative focal length), and object distance (u) = -30 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/(-15) = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/(-15) - 1/(-30)\n1/v = 2/(-30)\nv = -30/2\nv = -15 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 15 cm in front of the mirror (negative sign indicates it's a real image).\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nm = -(-15)/(-30)\nm = 15/30\nm = 1/2\n\nThe magnification is 1/2, which means the image is half the size of the object.\n\nSo, the image is formed 15 cm in front of the mirror, and its size is half the size of the object."
