    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, including the Milky Way. Although dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, it interacts with visible matter through gravity. It is estimated that dark matter constitutes about 85% of the total matter in the universe and about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content.\n\nIn the context of the Milky Way, dark matter contributes to its formation and evolution in several ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to initiate the collapse of gas clouds, leading to the formation of stars and galaxies. Without dark matter, the gravitational pull would be insufficient to form structures like the Milky Way.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies, including the Milky Way, show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxy together.\n\n3. Galaxy clusters and large-scale structure: Dark matter acts as the \"glue\" that holds galaxy clusters together and helps form the cosmic web of large-scale structures in the universe. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a cluster of galaxies that is held together by the gravitational influence of dark matter.\n\n4. Galaxy mergers and interactions: Dark matter plays a role in the interactions between galaxies, including mergers and tidal interactions. These processes can lead to the redistribution of stars and gas within galaxies, affecting their overall structure and evolution.\n\nIn summary, dark matter is essential for the formation and evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way. It provides the gravitational force needed to form stars and galaxies, holds galaxies together, and influences their interactions with other galaxies. The presence of dark matter affects the distribution of stars and gas in the galaxy, shaping its overall structure and evolution."
