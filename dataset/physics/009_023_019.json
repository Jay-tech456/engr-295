    "message_1": "A physics student wants to measure the polarization of light passing through a polarizer. The polarizer is placed between the light source and the detector. The student rotates the polarizer by an angle of 30 degrees and observes a reduction in the intensity of the light of 50%. What is the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and the incident light? (Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light. Mathematically, it is represented as:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted light intensity, I₀ is the incident light intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this problem, the intensity of the light is reduced by 50% after rotating the polarizer by 30 degrees. So, we have:\n\nI = 0.5 * I₀\n\nWe also know that the polarizer is rotated by 30 degrees, so the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and the incident light is (θ - 30°). Now, we can use Malus' Law to find the angle:\n\n0.5 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(θ - 30°)\n\nDivide both sides by I₀:\n\n0.5 = cos²(θ - 30°)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.5) = cos(θ - 30°)\n\ncos(θ - 30°) = ±sqrt(0.5) = ±1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides:\n\nθ - 30° = arccos(±1/sqrt(2))\n\nThere are two possible solutions for θ:\n\nθ₁ = 30° + arccos(1/sqrt(2))\nθ₂ = 30° - arccos(1/sqrt(2))\n\nθ₁ = 30° + 45° = 75°\nθ₂ = 30° - 45° = -15°\n\nSince the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and the incident light cannot be negative, the correct answer is:\n\nθ = 75°"
