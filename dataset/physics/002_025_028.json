    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of a mixture, we can use the mass-weighted average of the specific heat capacities of the individual components. The specific heat capacity of water (c_water) is 4.18 J/g°C, and the specific heat capacity of ethanol (c_ethanol) is 2.44 J/g°C.\n\nLet's assume we have a 100 g mixture of 60% water and 40% ethanol. This means we have 60 g of water and 40 g of ethanol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass-weighted average specific heat capacity (c_mixture) using the following formula:\n\nc_mixture = (mass_water * c_water + mass_ethanol * c_ethanol) / (mass_water + mass_ethanol)\n\nc_mixture = (60 g * 4.18 J/g°C + 40 g * 2.44 J/g°C) / (60 g + 40 g)\n\nc_mixture = (250.8 J/°C + 97.6 J/°C) / 100 g\n\nc_mixture = 348.4 J/°C / 100 g\n\nc_mixture = 3.484 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the mixture of 60% water and 40% ethanol at 25°C is approximately 3.484 J/g°C."
