    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\nP1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\nΔHvap is the heat of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol)\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe know the vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) is 1 atm (101.3 kPa). We want to find the vapor pressure at 25°C (298.15 K). We can use the known values and solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = -40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol·K * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nNow, we can solve for P2:\n\nln(P2/101.3) = 2.303\nP2/101.3 = e^2.303\nP2 = 101.3 * e^2.303\n\nP2 ≈ 3.17 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3.17 kPa."
