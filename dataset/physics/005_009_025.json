    "message_1": "A spacecraft is moving away from Earth at a speed of 0.9c. A radio signal with a frequency of 10 MHz is emitted from Earth towards the spacecraft. What frequency does the spacecraft receive? How does this compare to the frequency emitted from Earth?",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency received by the spacecraft, we need to consider the relativistic Doppler effect. The formula for the relativistic Doppler effect is:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed by the spacecraft, f_emitted is the frequency emitted from Earth, v is the velocity of the spacecraft relative to Earth, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nf_emitted = 10 MHz = 10 * 10^6 Hz\nv = 0.9c\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf_observed = 10 * 10^6 * sqrt((1 + 0.9) / (1 - 0.9))\nf_observed = 10 * 10^6 * sqrt(1.9 / 0.1)\nf_observed = 10 * 10^6 * sqrt(19)\n\nCalculating the observed frequency:\n\nf_observed ≈ 10 * 10^6 * 4.3589\nf_observed ≈ 43.589 * 10^6 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency received by the spacecraft is approximately 43.589 MHz.\n\nComparing this to the frequency emitted from Earth (10 MHz), we can see that the frequency received by the spacecraft is higher. This is due to the Doppler effect, which causes the frequency to increase as the source and the observer move away from each other at relativistic speeds."
