    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point directly above the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a rectangular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a * b) / (4 * π * (a^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, a and b are the dimensions of the loop, and x is the distance from the plane of the loop.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the loop, a = 0.5 m (50 cm) and b = 0.2 m (20 cm). The current I = 5 A, and the distance x = 0.1 m (10 cm).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.5 m * 0.2 m) / (4 * π * (0.5^2 + 0.1^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-7) T * 0.5 * 0.2) / ((0.5^2 + 0.1^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-7) T * 0.1) / (0.26^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 7.94 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point directly above the center of the loop is approximately 7.94 × 10^(-7) T.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your thumb in the direction of the current in the loop, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Since the current is flowing in a rectangular loop, the magnetic field will be directed out of the plane of the loop at the point directly above the center."
