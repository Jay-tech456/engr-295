    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through a polarizer is given by:\n\nI = I0 * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I0 is the initial intensity of the light, θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the light, and I is the intensity of the light after passing through the polarizer.\n\nFor an unpolarized light source, the average value of cos^2(θ) is 1/2. So when the light passes through the first polarizer, the intensity becomes:\n\nI1 = I0 * (1/2)\n\nNow, let's consider the second polarizer. We need to find the angle between the transmission axes of the first and second polarizers that will result in an extinction ratio of 1000:1. The extinction ratio is the ratio of the maximum to minimum transmitted intensity, which can be expressed as:\n\nExtinction Ratio = (I0 * cos^2(θ_max)) / (I0 * cos^2(θ_min))\n\nSince the extinction ratio is given as 1000:1, we have:\n\n1000 = cos^2(θ_max) / cos^2(θ_min)\n\nLet's assume that the second polarizer is oriented such that it allows the maximum intensity to pass through. In this case, θ_max = 0°, and cos^2(θ_max) = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n1000 = 1 / cos^2(θ_min)\n\nSolving for cos^2(θ_min), we get:\n\ncos^2(θ_min) = 1/1000\n\nNow, the light passes through the second polarizer, and its intensity becomes:\n\nI2 = I1 * cos^2(θ_min) = (I0 * (1/2)) * (1/1000)\n\nFor the third polarizer, let's assume it is oriented in the same direction as the first polarizer. In this case, the angle between the transmission axes of the second and third polarizers is θ_min. The intensity of the light after passing through the third polarizer is:\n\nI3 = I2 * cos^2(θ_min) = ((I0 * (1/2)) * (1/1000)) * (1/1000)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nI3 = I0 * (1/2) * (1/1000)^2\n\nSo the final intensity of the light after passing through all three polarizers is:\n\nI3 = I0 * (1/2) * (1/1000)^2"
