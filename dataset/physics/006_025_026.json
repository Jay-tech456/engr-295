    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the nuclear fusion of two deuterium atoms to form a helium-4 nucleus, we can use the conservation of energy principle and the mass-energy equivalence formula.\n\nFirst, let's find the masses of the particles involved:\n\nMass of deuterium atom (D) = 2.014 amu (atomic mass units)\nMass of helium-4 nucleus (He-4) = 4.0026 amu\n\nWe'll need to convert these masses to kilograms. The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nMass of D in kg = 2.014 amu * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu = 3.344 x 10^-27 kg\nMass of He-4 in kg = 4.0026 amu * 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu = 6.646 x 10^-27 kg\n\nNow, let's find the initial and final energies of the system.\n\nInitial energy (E_initial) = 2 * (mass of D) * c^2\nFinal energy (E_final) = (mass of He-4) * c^2 + 0.5 * (mass of He-4) * (0.05 * c)^2\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nE_initial = 2 * (3.344 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 6.009 x 10^-13 J\nE_final = (6.646 x 10^-27 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 + 0.5 * (6.646 x 10^-27 kg) * (0.05 * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 5.985 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow, we can find the energy released (ΔE) by subtracting the final energy from the initial energy:\n\nΔE = E_initial - E_final = 6.009 x 10^-13 J - 5.985 x 10^-13 J = 0.024 x 10^-13 J\n\nThe energy released in the nuclear fusion of two deuterium atoms to form a helium-4 nucleus is approximately 2.4 x 10^-15 Joules."
