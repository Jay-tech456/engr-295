    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum luminosity produced by an accretion disk around a black hole, we can use the Eddington luminosity formula:\n\nL_edd = 4 * π * G * M * c / κ\n\nwhere L_edd is the Eddington luminosity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and κ is the opacity (which is approximately 0.34 cm^2/g for electron scattering).\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\nM = 10^8 * M_sun = 10^8 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^38 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Eddington luminosity:\n\nL_edd = 4 * π * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.989 x 10^38 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (0.34 cm^2/g * 10^3 g/kg * 10^-4 m^2/cm^2)\nL_edd ≈ 1.26 x 10^38 W\n\nHowever, we are given an efficiency of converting mass to energy in the disk as 0.1. Therefore, the maximum luminosity produced by the accretion disk is:\n\nL_max = 0.1 * L_edd ≈ 0.1 * 1.26 x 10^38 W ≈ 1.26 x 10^37 W\n\nSo, the maximum luminosity that can be produced by an accretion disk around a black hole with a mass of 10^8 solar masses, with an efficiency of 0.1, is approximately 1.26 x 10^37 watts."
