    "message_2": "To calculate the force required to stretch a single strand of DNA to 1.5 times its original length, we need to know the Young's modulus of the DNA. Young's modulus (E) is a measure of the stiffness of a material and is defined as the ratio of stress to strain. For DNA, the Young's modulus is approximately 1000 piconewtons per nanometer squared (pN/nm²).\n\nFirst, let's find the strain (ε) of the DNA strand:\nε = (final length - original length) / original length\nε = (1.5 * 3 μm - 3 μm) / 3 μm\nε = (4.5 μm - 3 μm) / 3 μm\nε = 1.5 μm / 3 μm\nε = 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the stress (σ) acting on the DNA strand using Young's modulus:\nσ = E * ε\nσ = 1000 pN/nm² * 0.5\nσ = 500 pN/nm²\n\nFinally, we can find the force (F) required to stretch the DNA strand by multiplying the stress by the cross-sectional area:\nF = σ * A\nF = 500 pN/nm² * 0.1 nm²\nF = 50 piconewtons\n\nTherefore, the force required to stretch a single strand of DNA to 1.5 times its original length is 50 piconewtons."
