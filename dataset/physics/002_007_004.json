    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nQ = 20,000 J\nm = 500 g\nΔT = 45°C - 25°C = 20°C\n\nWe need to solve for c:\n\n20,000 J = (500 g) * c * (20°C)\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n\nc = 20,000 J / (500 g * 20°C)\nc = 20,000 J / 10,000 g°C\nc = 2 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of water in this case is 2 J/g°C."
