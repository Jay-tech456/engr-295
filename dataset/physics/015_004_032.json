    "message_1": "Calculate the total energy (in joules) emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion that releases 1.4 times the mass of the sun in the form of neutrinos. The distance between the supernova and the Earth is 10 kiloparsecs, and assume that 1% of the total energy released in the supernova explosion is in the form of gravitational waves.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy emitted in gravitational waves, we first need to find the total energy released in the supernova explosion.\n\nThe mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Since the supernova releases 1.4 times the mass of the sun in the form of neutrinos, the mass released is:\n\nmass_released = 1.4 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nUsing Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, we can find the total energy released in the supernova explosion:\n\nE = (2.7846 x 10^30 kg) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nE ≈ 2.506 x 10^47 Joules\n\nNow, we know that 1% of the total energy released is in the form of gravitational waves. So, the energy emitted in gravitational waves is:\n\nE_gravitational_waves = 0.01 * (2.506 x 10^47 Joules)\n\nE_gravitational_waves ≈ 2.506 x 10^45 Joules\n\nTherefore, the total energy emitted in gravitational waves by the supernova explosion is approximately 2.506 x 10^45 Joules."
