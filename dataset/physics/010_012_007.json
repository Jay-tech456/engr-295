If the plate is inclined at an angle of 10 degrees to the flow direction, determine the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance 0.5 meters from the leading edge of the plate.",
    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (x * (ν / U_∞))^0.5\n\nwhere x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate, ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and U_∞ is the free-stream velocity of the fluid.\n\nHowever, since the plate is inclined at an angle of 10 degrees to the flow direction, we need to find the component of the free-stream velocity that is parallel to the plate. We can do this using the following formula:\n\nU_parallel = U_∞ * cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the plate and the flow direction.\n\nFirst, let's find U_parallel:\n\nθ = 10 degrees = 10 * (π / 180) radians = 0.1745 radians\nU_∞ = 2 m/s\n\nU_parallel = 2 * cos(0.1745) = 1.98 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge of the plate:\n\nx = 0.5 m\nν = 1 x 10^-6 m^2/s\n\nδ = (0.5 * (1 x 10^-6 / 1.98))^0.5 = (0.5 * (5.05 x 10^-7))^0.5 = 0.000503 m\n\nThe thickness of the boundary layer at a distance of 0.5 meters from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.000503 meters or 0.503 mm."
