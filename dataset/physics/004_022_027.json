    "message_2": "Gravitational waves are produced by accelerating masses, such as those in a binary system where two massive objects, like neutron stars or black holes, orbit each other. As they orbit, they lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves, which causes the orbit to shrink and the objects to eventually merge.\n\nThe minimum mass of a neutron star that could produce detectable gravitational waves depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the distance to the neutron star binary system, and the masses of both objects in the binary system.\n\nCurrent gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are sensitive to neutron star binary systems with masses in the range of about 1 to 3 solar masses. The minimum mass of a neutron star is typically around 1.1 to 1.4 solar masses, below which the object would be a white dwarf instead. Therefore, a neutron star binary system with each neutron star having a mass of around 1.1 to 1.4 solar masses could potentially produce detectable gravitational waves.\n\nHowever, the detectability of gravitational waves also depends on the distance to the binary system. The farther away the system is, the weaker the gravitational waves will be when they reach Earth, making them more difficult to detect. For example, LIGO and Virgo have detected gravitational waves from neutron star binary systems up to around 130 million light-years away. If a neutron star binary system with minimum mass neutron stars were closer to Earth, it could potentially produce detectable gravitational waves.\n\nIn summary, the minimum mass of a neutron star that could produce detectable gravitational waves is around 1.1 to 1.4 solar masses, assuming it is in a binary system with another neutron star of similar mass and is close enough to Earth for the gravitational waves to be detected by current detectors like LIGO and Virgo."
