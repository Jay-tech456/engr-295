    "message_2": "The evidence of the interaction between dark matter and normal matter in a galaxy cluster comes from several observations and measurements. These interactions play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Dark matter does not emit or absorb light, making it difficult to detect directly. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter. One such effect is gravitational lensing, where the path of light from distant galaxies is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters. The amount of lensing observed can be used to estimate the mass distribution within the cluster, revealing the presence of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars and gas in galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass alone. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat or even increase with distance from the galactic center, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass. This \"missing mass\" is attributed to dark matter, which provides the extra gravitational force needed to explain the observed rotation curves.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB temperature reveal the distribution of matter, both normal and dark, in the early universe. The observed pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the presence of dark matter and its role in the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxy clusters and other large-scale structures in the universe. Simulations of cosmic structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Without dark matter, these simulations fail to reproduce the observed structures.\n\nThe interaction between dark matter and normal matter affects the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in several ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to pull normal matter together, allowing for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Without dark matter, the gravitational pull of normal matter alone would not be sufficient to form these structures.\n\n2. Halo formation: Dark matter forms massive, invisible halos around galaxies and galaxy clusters. These halos provide the gravitational \"glue\" that holds these structures together and influences their overall shape and distribution.\n\n3. Gas dynamics: The presence of dark matter affects the dynamics of gas within galaxy clusters. Dark matter's gravitational influence can cause gas to become compressed and heated, leading to the formation of stars and the growth of galaxies within the cluster.\n\n4. Merging and evolution: The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a role in the merging of galaxy clusters and their overall evolution. As clusters merge, their dark matter halos interact, influencing the distribution of normal matter and the overall structure of the resulting cluster.\n\nIn summary, the evidence for the interaction between dark matter and normal matter in galaxy clusters comes from various observations, such as gravitational lensing, galaxy rotation curves, the CMB, and large-scale structure formation. These interactions play a crucial role in the formation, evolution, and overall structure of galaxy clusters."
