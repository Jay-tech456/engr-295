    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a powerful tool in theoretical physics that relates a quantum field theory (QFT) in a certain spacetime to a gravitational theory in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This correspondence allows us to study strongly coupled systems in QFT by mapping them to weakly coupled gravitational systems, which are more tractable. In particular, it has been instrumental in understanding non-perturbative effects in the strong coupling regime of QFTs.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between two theories:\n\n1. A conformal field theory (CFT) living on the boundary of an (n+1)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime.\n2. A gravitational theory (usually a string or M-theory) living in the bulk of the (n+1)-dimensional AdS spacetime.\n\nThe mathematical formalism of the AdS/CFT correspondence can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The partition function of the CFT on the boundary is related to the partition function of the gravitational theory in the bulk:\n\n   Z_CFT[J] = Z_gravity[Φ]\n\n   Here, J represents the sources for the CFT operators, and Φ represents the boundary values of the bulk fields.\n\n2. The correlation functions of the CFT operators can be computed by taking functional derivatives of the partition functions with respect to the sources:\n\n   <O_1(x_1) ... O_n(x_n)> = (1/Z_CFT) δ^n Z_CFT / δJ_1(x_1) ... δJ_n(x_n)\n\n3. The bulk fields are related to the CFT operators through their boundary values:\n\n   Φ(x, z) -> z^Δ O(x) as z -> 0\n\n   Here, z is the radial coordinate in the AdS spacetime, and Δ is the scaling dimension of the CFT operator.\n\nTo compute holographic dualities in the strong coupling regime of QFTs using the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically follows these steps:\n\n1. Identify the appropriate AdS/CFT correspondence: Choose the appropriate CFT and its dual gravitational theory. For example, the most famous example is the duality between N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in 4 dimensions and Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5.\n\n2. Determine the relevant operators and their scaling dimensions: Identify the CFT operators that correspond to the non-perturbative effects of interest, and determine their scaling dimensions.\n\n3. Compute the bulk fields: Solve the classical equations of motion for the bulk fields, subject to appropriate boundary conditions that correspond to the CFT operators of interest.\n\n4. Calculate the correlation functions: Use the bulk fields to compute the correlation functions of the CFT operators. This can be done by evaluating the on-shell action of the bulk fields and taking functional derivatives with respect to the sources.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Interpret the results of the correlation functions in the context of the strongly coupled QFT, and extract information about the non-perturbative effects.\n\nIn summary, the AdS/CFT correspondence provides a powerful framework for studying non-perturbative effects in the strong coupling regime of QFTs. By mapping the strongly coupled QFT to a weakly coupled gravitational theory, one can compute correlation functions and extract valuable information about the non-perturbative behavior of the QFT."
