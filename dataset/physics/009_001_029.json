    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media (air and water), θ1 is the angle of incidence (30 degrees), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the indices of refraction for air and water. We can do this using the formula:\n\nn = c / v\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction, c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the speed of light in the medium.\n\nFor air:\nn1 = c / v_air = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) = 1\n\nFor water:\nn2 = c / v_water = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.25 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.333\n\nNow we can use Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction:\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.333 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = sin(30) / 1.333\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(30) / 1.333)\n\nθ2 ≈ 22.09 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 22.09 degrees.\n\nThe speed of light in water is given as 2.25 x 10^8 m/s."
