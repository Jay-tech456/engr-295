    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire measuring 2 cm by 3 cm is lying flat on a table. The wire has a resistance of 12 ohms. A current of 3 A is flowing through the wire in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the wire loop? (Assume that the loop is infinitely thin and lies in the x-y plane with its center at the origin.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the wire loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the loop is rectangular, we can simplify the calculation by considering the magnetic field produced by each of the four sides of the rectangle separately and then summing up their contributions.\n\nLet's consider each side of the rectangle:\n\n1. Side 1 (length 2 cm, current flowing to the right): The magnetic field produced by this side will be pointing into the table (using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of the magnetic field at the center due to this side can be calculated using Ampere's law:\n\nB1 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (3 A), and d is the distance from the wire to the center of the loop (1.5 cm or 0.015 m).\n\n2. Side 2 (length 3 cm, current flowing downward): The magnetic field produced by this side will be pointing to the left. The magnitude of the magnetic field at the center due to this side is:\n\nB2 = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere d is the distance from the wire to the center of the loop (1 cm or 0.01 m).\n\n3. Side 3 (length 2 cm, current flowing to the left): The magnetic field produced by this side will be pointing out of the table. The magnitude of the magnetic field at the center due to this side is the same as B1, as the distance and current are the same.\n\n4. Side 4 (length 3 cm, current flowing upward): The magnetic field produced by this side will be pointing to the right. The magnitude of the magnetic field at the center due to this side is the same as B2, as the distance and current are the same.\n\nNow, we can sum up the contributions from each side. The magnetic fields produced by sides 1 and 3 are opposite in direction and have the same magnitude, so they will cancel each other out. The magnetic fields produced by sides 2 and 4 are also opposite in direction and have the same magnitude, so they will cancel each other out as well.\n\nTherefore, the net magnetic field at the center of the wire loop is zero."
