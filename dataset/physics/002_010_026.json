    "message_1": "What is the latent heat of vaporization of water at room temperature, given that the initial temperature of the water sample is 25째C, and it is heated until it starts boiling at 100째C, keeping the pressure constant at atmospheric pressure?",
    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization of water is a property that is independent of the initial temperature of the water sample. It is the amount of energy required to change 1 kg of water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase at a constant temperature and pressure (in this case, at the boiling point of 100째C and atmospheric pressure).\n\nThe latent heat of vaporization of water at 100째C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 2.26 x 10^6 J/kg."
