    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of oxygen at a pressure of 50 atm, we can use the principle of corresponding states. This principle states that the properties of a gas under certain conditions can be related to its critical properties. \n\nFor this problem, we can use the reduced pressure (Pr) and reduced temperature (Tr) to find the critical temperature at the given pressure. The reduced pressure and reduced temperature are defined as:\n\nPr = P / Pc\nTr = T / Tc\n\nwhere P is the pressure, Pc is the critical pressure, T is the temperature, and Tc is the critical temperature. We are given the critical pressure (Pc = 49.8 atm) and critical temperature (Tc = -118.57°C) of oxygen.\n\nFirst, we need to find the reduced pressure (Pr) at the given pressure of 50 atm:\n\nPr = P / Pc = 50 atm / 49.8 atm = 1.004016\n\nNow, we can use the principle of corresponding states, which states that gases with the same reduced pressure (Pr) and reduced temperature (Tr) have the same properties. Since we are trying to find the critical temperature at a pressure of 50 atm, we can assume that the reduced temperature (Tr) remains the same as that of the given critical temperature.\n\nTo find the reduced temperature (Tr) at the given critical temperature, we can use the formula:\n\nTr = T / Tc\n\nWe need to convert the given critical temperature to Kelvin:\n\nTc = -118.57°C + 273.15 = 154.58 K\n\nNow, we can find the reduced temperature (Tr):\n\nTr = T / Tc = 1 (since the reduced temperature remains the same)\n\nNow, we can find the critical temperature (T) at the given pressure of 50 atm:\n\nT = Tr * Tc = 1 * 154.58 K = 154.58 K\n\nFinally, we can convert the critical temperature back to Celsius:\n\nT = 154.58 K - 273.15 = -118.57°C\n\nSo, the critical temperature of oxygen at a pressure of 50 atm is approximately -118.57°C."
