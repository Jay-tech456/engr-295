    "message_1": "A beam of monochromatic light with a wavelength of 550 nm and a power of 5 mW is incident on a single slit. The width of the slit is 1 mm. Determine the angle at which the first minimum occurs in the diffraction pattern.",
    "message_2": "To determine the angle at which the first minimum occurs in the diffraction pattern, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere:\nθ = angle of the first minimum\nm = order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum)\nλ = wavelength of the light (550 nm = 550 * 10^(-9) m)\na = width of the slit (1 mm = 1 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 550 * 10^(-9)) / (1 * 10^(-3))\n\nsin(θ) = 550 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(550 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 0.032 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees:\n\nθ ≈ 0.032 * (180/π) ≈ 1.83 degrees\n\nSo, the angle at which the first minimum occurs in the diffraction pattern is approximately 1.83 degrees."
