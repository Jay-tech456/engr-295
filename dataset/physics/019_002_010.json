    "message_2": "The renormalization procedure in quantum field theory (QFT) is a mathematical technique used to deal with the infinities that arise in the calculations of certain physical quantities, such as the self-energy of particles or the strength of their interactions. These infinities are a consequence of the fact that QFT treats particles as point-like objects, which leads to divergent results when considering their interactions at very short distances.\n\nThe physical interpretation of renormalization is that it provides a way to systematically account for the effects of high-energy or short-distance fluctuations in the quantum fields. In other words, renormalization allows us to separate the contributions from the \"bare\" parameters of the theory (such as the bare mass and charge of a particle) and the effects of the quantum fluctuations that modify these parameters at observable energy scales.\n\nThe renormalization procedure involves introducing a cutoff scale, which is an artificial energy scale that separates the low-energy (long-distance) physics we are interested in from the high-energy (short-distance) physics we don't know much about. The idea is to perform calculations up to this cutoff scale and then absorb the infinite contributions into the redefinition of the bare parameters of the theory. This leads to the concept of \"renormalized\" parameters, which are the physically observable quantities.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) is a powerful tool that helps us understand how the physical quantities change as we vary the energy scale. It provides a systematic way to study the dependence of the renormalized parameters on the energy scale and helps us understand the behavior of the theory at different scales.\n\nIn summary, the physical interpretation of the renormalization procedure in QFT is that it allows us to account for the effects of high-energy or short-distance fluctuations in the quantum fields, and it provides a way to connect the bare parameters of the theory with the physically observable quantities. The renormalization group further helps us understand the behavior of the theory at different energy scales and provides insights into the fundamental structure of the quantum field theories."
