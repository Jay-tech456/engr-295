    "message_1": "A Carnot heat engine operates between a hot reservoir of temperature 400 K and a cold reservoir of temperature 300 K. If the engine absorbs 600 J of heat energy from the hot reservoir per cycle, what is the total work done by the engine in one cycle and what is its efficiency?",
    "message_2": "To find the efficiency of a Carnot heat engine, we can use the formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 400 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 400 K) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nSo, the efficiency of the Carnot heat engine is 25%.\n\nNow, we know that the engine absorbs 600 J of heat energy from the hot reservoir per cycle. To find the work done by the engine in one cycle, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Efficiency × Heat absorbed\n\nWork = 0.25 × 600 J = 150 J\n\nTherefore, the total work done by the engine in one cycle is 150 J, and its efficiency is 25%."
