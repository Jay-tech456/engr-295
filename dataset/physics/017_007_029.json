We focus on how varying levels of disorder impact the topological surface states and bulk states, and explore the contributions of different types of disorder, such as impurities, defects, and surface roughness. We employ theoretical models and simulations to study various scenarios and present our findings in a comprehensive manner.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTopological insulators and semimetals are materials with unique electronic properties, characterized by insulating bulk states and conducting surface states. These materials have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. However, the presence of disorder can significantly affect their electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the impact of disorder on the topological surface states and bulk states, and explore the contributions of different types of disorder.\n\n2. Theoretical Models and Simulation Methods\n\nTo study the effects of disorder on the electronic properties of topological insulators and semimetals, we use the following theoretical models and simulation methods:\n\n2.1 Tight-binding model: This model is used to describe the electronic structure of the materials, considering the hopping amplitudes between neighboring atomic sites.\n\n2.2 Anderson model: This model is employed to introduce disorder into the system, by adding random on-site potentials to the tight-binding Hamiltonian.\n\n2.3 Green's function method: This method is used to calculate the local density of states (LDOS) and the conductance of the system, which are the main quantities of interest in our study.\n\n3. Effects of Disorder on Topological Surface States\n\nWe find that the presence of disorder can significantly affect the topological surface states in the following ways:\n\n3.1 Gap opening: Disorder can induce a gap opening in the surface states, which can lead to a transition from a topological insulator to a trivial insulator.\n\n3.2 Localization: Disorder can cause the surface states to become localized, which reduces the surface conductance and affects the transport properties of the material.\n\n3.3 Scattering: Disorder can lead to increased scattering between the surface states and the bulk states, which can result in a reduction of the surface-to-bulk conductance ratio.\n\n4. Effects of Disorder on Bulk States\n\nWe observe that disorder can also have significant effects on the bulk states of topological insulators and semimetals:\n\n4.1 Bandgap reduction: Disorder can cause a reduction in the bulk bandgap, which can lead to an increase in the bulk conductivity.\n\n4.2 Anderson localization: In the presence of strong disorder, the bulk states can undergo Anderson localization, which can result in an insulating behavior.\n\n5. Contributions of Different Types of Disorder\n\nWe find that different types of disorder can have distinct effects on the electronic properties of topological insulators and semimetals:\n\n5.1 Impurities: The presence of impurities can lead to the formation of impurity bands, which can affect the surface states and the bulk states.\n\n5.2 Defects: Structural defects, such as vacancies and dislocations, can cause local distortions in the electronic structure and can lead to the localization of states.\n\n5.3 Surface roughness: Surface roughness can cause scattering between the surface states and the bulk states, which can affect the transport properties of the material.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, our study reveals that disorder can have significant effects on the electronic properties of topological insulators and semimetals. The presence of disorder can lead to gap opening, localization, and scattering in the topological surface states, as well as bandgap reduction and Anderson localization in the bulk states. Different types of disorder, such as impurities, defects, and surface roughness, can have distinct contributions to these effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of disorder in topological materials and can guide the design of more robust materials for future applications."
