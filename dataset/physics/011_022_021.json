    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy for the thin film of cobalt, we need to know the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (K1) for cobalt. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (E) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE = K1 * V * sin^2(θ)\n\nwhere V is the volume of the thin film, and θ is the angle between the easy magnetization direction (<110>) and the normal direction of the thin film surface ((111) plane).\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the thin film:\n\nV = thickness * width * length\nV = (10 * 10^(-9) m) * (1 * 10^(-2) m) * (1 * 10^(-2) m)\nV = 1 * 10^(-12) m^3\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the <110> and (111) directions. The angle between the two directions can be calculated using the dot product of their direction vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (u1 * u2 + v1 * v2 + w1 * w2) / (sqrt(u1^2 + v1^2 + w1^2) * sqrt(u2^2 + v2^2 + w2^2))\n\nFor the <110> direction, the direction vector is [1, 1, 0]. For the (111) plane normal direction, the direction vector is [1, 1, 1]. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ncos(θ) = (1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 1) / (sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) * sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2))\ncos(θ) = 2 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(3))\ncos(θ) = 2 / (sqrt(6))\nθ = arccos(2 / sqrt(6))\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (K1) for cobalt. The value of K1 for cobalt is approximately 4.5 * 10^5 J/m^3.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy (E):\n\nE = K1 * V * sin^2(θ)\nE = (4.5 * 10^5 J/m^3) * (1 * 10^(-12) m^3) * sin^2(arccos(2 / sqrt(6)))\nE ≈ 1.58 * 10^(-7) J\n\nSo, the magnetic anisotropy energy for this thin film of cobalt is approximately 1.58 * 10^(-7) J."
