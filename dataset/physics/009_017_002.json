    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and second minimums on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minimums in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum, m = 2 for the second minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 633 nm = 633 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minimums:\n\nθ1 = (1 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 6.33 * 10^(-6) radians\nθ2 = (2 * 633 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 12.66 * 10^(-6) radians\n\nThe distance between the first and second minimums on the screen can be found using the small angle approximation formula:\n\nΔx = L * (θ2 - θ1)\n\nwhere Δx is the distance between the minimums and L is the distance between the slit and the screen (1 meter in this case).\n\nΔx = 1 * (12.66 * 10^(-6) - 6.33 * 10^(-6)) = 6.33 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second minimums on the screen is approximately 6.33 * 10^(-6) meters or 6.33 micrometers."
