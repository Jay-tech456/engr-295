    "message_1": "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, for the following reaction at 298 K:\n2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l) \nGiven that the standard Gibbs energy of formation of H2O (l) at 298 K is -237.2 kJ/mol, and H2 (g) and O2 (g) are in their standard state.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nSince H2 (g) and O2 (g) are in their standard state, their standard Gibbs energy of formation is 0. Therefore, we only need to consider the Gibbs energy of formation for H2O (l).\n\nFor the reaction, 2 moles of H2O (l) are formed. So, we need to multiply the standard Gibbs energy of formation of H2O (l) by 2:\n\nΔG(products) = 2 * (-237.2 kJ/mol) = -474.4 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants) = -474.4 kJ/mol - 0 = -474.4 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction is -474.4 kJ/mol."
