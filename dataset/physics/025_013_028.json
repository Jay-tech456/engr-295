    "message_2": "The spectral sensitivity of human vision refers to the ability of the human eye to detect and respond to different wavelengths of light. It is primarily determined by the presence of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina, called cones, which are responsible for color vision. These cones are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths, and they are classified as short-wavelength (S), medium-wavelength (M), and long-wavelength (L) cones.\n\nThe S-cones are most sensitive to wavelengths around 420-440 nm (blue light), M-cones are most sensitive to wavelengths around 530-540 nm (green light), and L-cones are most sensitive to wavelengths around 560-580 nm (red light). The combined response of these cones to different wavelengths of light forms the basis of human color perception.\n\nThe spectral sensitivity of human vision affects the perception of color under different lighting conditions because the color of an object depends on the wavelengths of light it reflects or emits. When the lighting conditions change, the wavelengths of light reaching our eyes from an object may also change, causing the perceived color of the object to change. This phenomenon is known as color constancy.\n\nFor example, under sunlight, which has a relatively uniform distribution of wavelengths, colors appear vivid and natural. However, under artificial lighting, such as incandescent or fluorescent lights, the distribution of wavelengths may be different, causing colors to appear differently than they would under sunlight. This is because the spectral composition of the light source can emphasize or de-emphasize certain wavelengths, affecting the way our cones respond to the light and ultimately altering our perception of color.\n\nIn summary, the spectral sensitivity of human vision is determined by the response of the three types of cones in the retina to different wavelengths of light. This sensitivity affects the perception of color under different lighting conditions, as the wavelengths of light reaching our eyes from an object can change depending on the light source, causing the perceived color of the object to change."
