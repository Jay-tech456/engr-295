    "message_2": "To calculate the total relativistic energy and momentum of a proton moving at 0.9c, we need to use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E): E = γmc^2\n2. Relativistic momentum (p): p = γmv\n\nwhere\n- γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n- m is the mass of the proton (approximately 1.67 × 10^-27 kg)\n- v is the velocity of the proton (0.9c)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, let's calculate the total relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE ≈ 2.294 × (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) × (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 2.294 × (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) × (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nE ≈ 3.463 × 10^-10 J\n\nFinally, let's calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np ≈ 2.294 × (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) × (0.9 × 3 × 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 2.294 × (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) × (2.7 × 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 1.036 × 10^-18 kg m/s\n\nSo, the total relativistic energy of the proton is approximately 3.463 × 10^-10 J, and its relativistic momentum is approximately 1.036 × 10^-18 kg m/s."
