    "message_1": "What is the predicted mass range for sterile neutrinos if they make up all of the dark matter in the universe according to current astrophysical observations, and how would such a mass range impact our understanding of the thermal history and evolution of the universe?",
    "message_2": "The predicted mass range for sterile neutrinos, if they make up all of the dark matter in the universe, is still a subject of ongoing research and debate. However, current astrophysical observations and theoretical considerations suggest that their mass could lie within the range of a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to a few tens of keV.\n\nIf sterile neutrinos with such a mass range indeed make up all of the dark matter in the universe, it would have significant implications for our understanding of the thermal history and evolution of the universe. Sterile neutrinos are considered \"warm dark matter\" candidates, which means they would have been relativistic (moving close to the speed of light) during the early stages of the universe. This would affect the formation of cosmic structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, in a different way compared to the more widely accepted \"cold dark matter\" scenario.\n\nIn the warm dark matter scenario, the free-streaming of relativistic sterile neutrinos would suppress the formation of small-scale structures, leading to a \"top-down\" hierarchical structure formation. This means that larger structures would form first, followed by smaller structures. This is in contrast to the \"bottom-up\" formation in the cold dark matter scenario, where smaller structures form first and then merge to create larger structures.\n\nThe impact of sterile neutrinos as dark matter on the thermal history of the universe would also depend on their production mechanism. If they are produced through non-thermal processes, such as oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos, they could potentially affect the primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background radiation, providing additional constraints on their properties.\n\nIn summary, if sterile neutrinos with a mass range of a few keV to a few tens of keV make up all of the dark matter in the universe, it would have important consequences for our understanding of the thermal history and the evolution of cosmic structures. Further experimental and observational efforts are needed to test this hypothesis and refine our knowledge of the nature of dark matter."
