    "message_2": "The electrical conductivity of graphene is affected by temperature due to the presence of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in the material. Graphene is a two-dimensional, single-layer sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, and it exhibits remarkable electronic properties, including high electrical conductivity.\n\nAt low temperatures, graphene behaves as a semi-metal or zero-gap semiconductor, which means that its electrical conductivity is relatively high, even at low carrier concentrations. As the temperature increases, the number of thermally excited charge carriers also increases, leading to an increase in electrical conductivity. However, at higher temperatures, the increased lattice vibrations (phonons) in the graphene sheet can cause increased scattering of the charge carriers, which can lead to a decrease in electrical conductivity.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of graphene is not straightforward and depends on the balance between the increase in charge carriers due to thermal excitation and the decrease in conductivity due to increased scattering by lattice vibrations. Generally, at low temperatures, the electrical conductivity of graphene increases with increasing temperature, while at high temperatures, the conductivity may decrease due to increased scattering effects. The exact behavior depends on the specific sample, its purity, and the presence of defects or impurities in the graphene sheet."
