    "message_2": "The Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is the distance between the nucleus and the electron in the ground state (n=1) according to Bohr's model. The formula for the Bohr radius (a₀) is given by:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e e²)\n\nwhere:\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²)\n- ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n- m_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10⁻³¹ kg)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)\n\nNow, let's calculate the Bohr radius:\n\na₀ = (4π * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² * (1.055 x 10⁻³⁴)²) / (9.109 x 10⁻³¹ * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹)²)\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nThe Bohr radius is approximately 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ meters or 52.91 picometers (pm).\n\nThe experimentally obtained value of the Bohr radius is also approximately 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ meters. Therefore, the calculated value using the formula derived from Bohr's theory is in good agreement with the experimentally obtained value."
