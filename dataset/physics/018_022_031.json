    "message_2": "The probability of a top quark decaying to a W boson and a bottom quark is determined by the branching ratio of this decay mode. In the Standard Model of particle physics, top quarks decay almost exclusively to a W boson and a bottom quark, with a branching ratio of nearly 100%.\n\nHowever, the probability of producing a top quark in a proton-proton collision at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is a separate question. This probability depends on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding protons and the cross-section for top quark production.\n\nThe cross-section for top quark pair production (ttbar) at 13 TeV is about 800 picobarns (pb). The cross-section for single top quark production is lower, with the t-channel process having a cross-section of about 150 pb, the s-channel process having a cross-section of about 10 pb, and the tW-associated production having a cross-section of about 50 pb.\n\nTo calculate the probability of producing a top quark in a proton-proton collision at the LHC, we can add the cross-sections for all these processes and divide by the total inelastic proton-proton cross-section at 13 TeV, which is about 70 millibarns (mb).\n\nProbability = (800 pb + 150 pb + 10 pb + 50 pb) / 70,000 pb â‰ˆ 0.0143 or 1.43%\n\nSo, the probability of producing a top quark in a proton-proton collision at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is about 1.43%. Since the branching ratio for the top quark to decay to a W boson and a bottom quark is nearly 100%, the probability of this specific decay occurring in a proton-proton collision at the LHC is also approximately 1.43%."
