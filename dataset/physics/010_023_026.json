    "message_2": "The Rossby number (Ro) is a dimensionless number used in geophysical fluid dynamics to describe the ratio of inertial forces to Coriolis forces in a rotating system. It is defined as:\n\nRo = U / (f * L)\n\nwhere U is the mean flow speed, f is the Coriolis parameter, and L is the characteristic length scale (in this case, the radius of curvature).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Coriolis parameter (f) using the following formula:\n\nf = 2 * ω * sin(ϕ)\n\nwhere ω is the Earth's angular velocity (approximately 7.2921 × 10^-5 rad/s) and ϕ is the latitude in radians.\n\nϕ = 35° * (π / 180) = 0.610865 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the Coriolis parameter:\n\nf = 2 * (7.2921 × 10^-5 rad/s) * sin(0.610865)\nf ≈ 9.374 × 10^-5 s^-1\n\nNow that we have the Coriolis parameter, we can calculate the Rossby number:\n\nRo = U / (f * L)\nRo = 1 m/s / ((9.374 × 10^-5 s^-1) * (25 × 10^3 m))\nRo ≈ 0.424\n\nTherefore, the Rossby number of the oceanic circulation system in the Gulf Stream is approximately 0.424."
