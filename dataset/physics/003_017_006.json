    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm * 5) / 0.2 m\nB = 5π × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 5π × 10^(-5) T or 1.57 × 10^(-4) T.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.05 m along the axis of the loop. We can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop on its axis:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance along the axis from the center of the loop.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.1 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.1 m)^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm * 0.01 m^2) / (2 * (0.0125 m^2)^(3/2))\nB = (2π × 10^(-8) Tm) / (2 * 0.003354 m^3)\nB ≈ 2.98 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 0.05 m along the axis of the loop is approximately 2.98 × 10^(-5) T."
