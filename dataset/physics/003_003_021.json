    "message_1": "A toroid has a mean radius of 15 cm and a circular cross-sectional area of 8 cm². There are 500 turns of wire on the toroid, through which a current of 4 A flows. Calculate the magnetic field strength inside the toroid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nFor a toroid, the magnetic field is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns of wire, I is the current flowing through the wire, and R is the mean radius of the toroid.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nN = 500 turns\nI = 4 A\nR = 15 cm = 0.15 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 * 4) / (2 * π * 0.15)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2000) / (0.3)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7)) / (0.3)\n\nB ≈ 8.37 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength inside the toroid is approximately 8.37 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
