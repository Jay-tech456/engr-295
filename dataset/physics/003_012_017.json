    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the plane located 5 cm away from the loop's center, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields to get the total magnetic field at the point.\n\nLet's consider the point P to be in the plane perpendicular to the loop and 5 cm away from the center of the loop. We can use symmetry to simplify the problem. The magnetic field due to the two shorter segments (2 cm) will cancel each other out at point P, as they are opposite and equidistant from P. Similarly, the magnetic field due to the two longer segments (3 cm) will add up at point P.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to one longer segment (3 cm) at point P. We can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * d) * (cosθ₁ - cosθ₂)\n\nwhere d is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point P, θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles between the position vector r and the wire at the two ends of the wire.\n\nIn this case, d = 5 cm, I = 4 A, and the angles θ₁ and θ₂ can be calculated using trigonometry. Let's denote half of the length of the longer segment as L (L = 1.5 cm). Then, we have:\n\ntanθ₁ = L / d => θ₁ = arctan(L/d) = arctan(1.5/5)\ntanθ₂ = L / d => θ₂ = arctan(L/d) = arctan(1.5/5)\n\nSince the angles are equal, cosθ₁ = cosθ₂, and the magnetic field due to one longer segment at point P is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4π * d) * (cosθ₁ - cosθ₂) = 0\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the magnetic fields due to the two longer segments will add up at point P. However, since the magnetic field due to one longer segment is 0, the total magnetic field at point P is also 0 T."
