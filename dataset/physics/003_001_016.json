    "message_1": "A wire carrying a current of 10 A has a circular loop of radius 5 cm. Determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the current I = 10 A and the radius r = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can now calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\nB = (4π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.1 m)\nB = 40π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 40π × 10^(-6) T or 1.26 × 10^(-4) T."
