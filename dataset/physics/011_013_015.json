    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) of the metal wire, we can use the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nwhere ρ is the resistivity of the material. In this case, the resistivity of copper is given as 1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm.\n\nFirst, let's find the conductivity:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10^7 S/m\n\nNow we have the electrical conductivity of the copper wire. However, the problem also provides the length and cross-sectional area of the wire. We can use this information to find the resistance (R) of the wire using the formula:\n\nR = ρ * (L / A)\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the cross-sectional area from mm² to m²:\n\n1 mm² = 1 × 10^-6 m²\n\nNow, we can find the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ωm) * (2 m / 1 × 10^-6 m²)\nR ≈ 0.0336 Ω\n\nIn summary, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire is approximately 5.95 × 10^7 S/m, and the resistance of the wire is approximately 0.0336 Ω."
