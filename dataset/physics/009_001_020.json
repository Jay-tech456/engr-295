Determine the position of the image and its magnification. If the height of the candle flame is 1.5 cm, what is the height of the image formed by the mirror?",
    "message_2": "To determine the position of the image, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. For a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is equal to twice the focal length (f = R/2). In this case, the radius of curvature is 30 cm, so the focal length is 15 cm.\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/15 = 1/60 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n4/60 = 1/60 + 1/v\n\nSubtract 1/60 from both sides:\n\n3/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 60/3 = 20 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed 20 cm from the mirror.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -20/60 = -1/3\n\nThe magnification is -1/3, which means the image is inverted and 1/3 the size of the object.\n\nFinally, to find the height of the image, we can multiply the height of the object (1.5 cm) by the magnification:\n\nImage height = Object height × Magnification\nImage height = 1.5 × (-1/3)\nImage height = -0.5 cm\n\nThe image formed by the mirror is 0.5 cm tall and inverted (indicated by the negative sign)."
