Then, evaluate the present-day value of the Hubble parameter assuming the current age of the universe to be 13.8 billion years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first write down the Friedmann equation, which is derived from the FLRW metric and describes the expansion of the universe. For a flat universe (k=0), the Friedmann equation is given by:\n\nH^2 = (a'(t)/a(t))^2 = (8πG/3)(ρ_m + ρ_Λ),\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, a(t) is the scale factor, G is the gravitational constant, and ρ_m and ρ_Λ are the energy densities of matter and dark energy, respectively.\n\nWe know that the energy densities evolve with the scale factor as follows:\n\nρ_m = ρ_m0 * (a0/a)^3,\nρ_Λ = ρ_Λ0,\n\nwhere ρ_m0 and ρ_Λ0 are the present-day energy densities of matter and dark energy, respectively, and a0 is the present-day scale factor (normalized to 1).\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Friedmann equation, we get:\n\nH^2 = H0^2 * (Ω_m0 * (a0/a)^3 + Ω_Λ0),\n\nwhere H0 is the present-day Hubble parameter, and Ω_m0 and Ω_Λ0 are the present-day dimensionless density parameters for matter and dark energy, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for a(t) as a function of time. This is a difficult task, but we can make some simplifications. First, let's assume that the universe is dominated by matter at early times and by dark energy at late times. In the matter-dominated era, the equation becomes:\n\nH^2 ≈ H0^2 * Ω_m0 * (a0/a)^3.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\na'(t)/a(t) ≈ H0 * sqrt(Ω_m0) * (a0/a)^3/2.\n\nThis is a separable differential equation, which we can solve by integrating both sides:\n\n∫(a/√(a^3))da = ∫(H0 * sqrt(Ω_m0) * a0^(3/2))dt.\n\nUpon integrating, we get:\n\n2 * √(a) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m0) * a0^(3/2) * t + C,\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. Setting a(t=0) = 0, we find that C = 0. Thus, the scale factor as a function of time in the matter-dominated era is:\n\na(t) = (H0 * sqrt(Ω_m0) * a0^(3/2) * t)^2/4.\n\nIn the dark energy-dominated era, the Friedmann equation becomes:\n\nH^2 ≈ H0^2 * Ω_Λ0.\n\nThis implies that H is approximately constant, so the scale factor grows exponentially:\n\na(t) = a0 * exp(H0 * sqrt(Ω_Λ0) * (t - t0)),\n\nwhere t0 is the time when the transition from matter to dark energy domination occurs.\n\nNow, let's find the present-day value of the Hubble parameter. We know that the current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. Using the standard cosmological parameters (Ω_m0 ≈ 0.3, Ω_Λ0 ≈ 0.7), we can estimate the present-day Hubble parameter:\n\nH0 = 100 * h km/s/Mpc,\n\nwhere h is a dimensionless parameter that is approximately equal to 0.7. Thus, the present-day Hubble parameter is:\n\nH0 ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc."
