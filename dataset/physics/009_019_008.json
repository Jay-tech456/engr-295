    "message_2": "In the Young's double-slit experiment, the interference pattern is formed due to the superposition of light waves from two slits. The distance between the interference maxima (bright fringes) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔy = L * λ / d\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between two consecutive maxima, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, λ is the wavelength of light, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nHowever, we are not given the distance L in the problem. To find the distance between two orthogonally polarized interference maxima, we need to consider that the path difference between the two waves is half the wavelength (λ/2) for destructive interference to occur.\n\nPath difference = d * sin(θ)\n\nFor small angles, sin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ, where θ is the angle between the central maximum and the position of the interference maxima.\n\nSo, the path difference can be written as:\n\nd * θ = λ / 2\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = (λ / 2) / d\n\nθ = (600 nm / 2) / 0.2 mm\n\nConvert the units to be consistent:\n\nθ = (600 * 10^(-9) m / 2) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\n\nθ = (3 * 10^(-7) m) / (2 * 10^(-4) m)\n\nθ = 1.5 * 10^(-3)\n\nNow, we can use the formula Δy = L * λ / d to find the distance between the two orthogonally polarized interference maxima:\n\nΔy = L * (λ / 2) / d\n\nΔy = L * (1.5 * 10^(-3))\n\nSince we don't have the value of L, we can't find the exact distance between the two orthogonally polarized interference maxima. However, we have found the relationship between the distance Δy and the distance L:\n\nΔy = 1.5 * 10^(-3) * L"
