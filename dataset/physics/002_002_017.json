    "message_1": "A copper block with a mass of 500 grams and an initial temperature of 200°C is placed in 1 liter of water at 25°C. If the final temperature of the block and water mixture is 50°C, what is the amount of heat transferred from the block to the water? (Assume the specific heat capacity of copper to be 0.385 J/g°C and the specific heat capacity of water to be 4.184 J/g°C).",
    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat transferred from the copper block to the water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat lost by the copper block:\n\nQ_copper = m_copper * c_copper * ΔT_copper\n\nm_copper = 500 g\nc_copper = 0.385 J/g°C\nΔT_copper = T_initial - T_final = 200°C - 50°C = 150°C\n\nQ_copper = 500 g * 0.385 J/g°C * 150°C = 28875 J\n\nSince the heat lost by the copper block is equal to the heat gained by the water, we can find the heat transferred to the water:\n\nQ_water = Q_copper = 28875 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat transferred from the copper block to the water is 28,875 Joules."
