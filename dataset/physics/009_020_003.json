    "message_2": "To determine the angle at which the first-order maximum occurs, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the diffraction grating, θ is the angle of the diffracted light, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the diffraction grating. Since there are 5000 lines per centimeter, we can find the distance between the lines as follows:\n\nd = 1 / 5000 lines/cm = 0.0002 cm = 0.000002 m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the diffraction grating equation. We are looking for the first-order maximum, so m = 1. The wavelength of the light is given as 550 nm, which is equal to 550 * 10^(-9) m.\n\n0.000002 m * sin(θ) = 1 * (550 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (550 * 10^(-9) m) / 0.000002 m\n\nsin(θ) ≈ 0.275\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine of 0.275:\n\nθ ≈ arcsin(0.275)\n\nθ ≈ 16.19°\n\nTherefore, the angle at which the first-order maximum occurs is approximately 16.19°."
