    "message_2": "The predicted mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) produced in the early universe depends on the specific inflationary model and the density fluctuations that occurred during that time. PBHs are thought to form from the collapse of high-density regions in the early universe, and their mass distribution is determined by the power spectrum of these density fluctuations.\n\nOne of the most widely used mass distributions for PBHs is the power-law mass function, which can be written as:\n\ndN/dM ∝ M^(-α)\n\nwhere dN is the number of PBHs in the mass range M to M+dM, and α is the power-law index. The value of α depends on the specific inflationary model and the density fluctuations.\n\nBlack hole evaporation, also known as Hawking radiation, causes black holes to lose mass over time. The evaporation timescale for a black hole is proportional to the cube of its mass. Therefore, smaller PBHs evaporate faster than larger ones. PBHs with initial masses less than about 10^15 grams would have already evaporated by now, while more massive PBHs would still exist.\n\nObservational constraints on the abundance of PBHs come from various sources, such as gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and the effects on large-scale structure formation. These constraints typically set upper limits on the fraction of dark matter that can be composed of PBHs in different mass ranges.\n\nFor example, microlensing surveys like the MACHO and EROS projects have constrained the abundance of PBHs with masses between 10^-7 and 1 solar mass. CMB anisotropies and large-scale structure formation constraints apply to PBHs with masses greater than 10^2 solar masses. These constraints generally indicate that PBHs cannot make up a significant fraction of the total dark matter in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass distribution of primordial black holes depends on the specific inflationary model and density fluctuations in the early universe. Observational constraints from various sources suggest that PBHs cannot account for a significant fraction of the dark matter in the universe. However, the exact mass distribution and abundance of PBHs remain open questions in cosmology and astrophysics."
