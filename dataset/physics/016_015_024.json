    "message_2": "To determine the critical current for a Josephson junction, we need to know the critical current density (Jc) of the superconducting material. The critical current (Ic) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIc = Jc * A\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the junction.\n\nHowever, since the critical current density (Jc) is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact critical current (Ic) for this specific Josephson junction.\n\nRegarding the ratio of the maximum current to the critical current, it is important to note that the maximum current that can flow through a Josephson junction without causing it to switch to the resistive state is equal to the critical current itself. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum current to the critical current for this junction is 1:1 or simply 1."
