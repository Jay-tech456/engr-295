    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the spacecraft, we can use the following equation:\n\nrelativistic mass (m) = rest mass (m0) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1000 kg\nv = 0.8c\n\nWe can plug these values into the equation:\n\nm = 1000 kg / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nm = 1000 kg / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nm = 1000 kg / sqrt(0.36)\n\nm = 1000 kg / 0.6\n\nm â‰ˆ 1666.67 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the spacecraft is approximately 1666.67 kg."
