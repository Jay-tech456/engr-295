    "message_2": "The effective field theory (EFT) for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a simplified description of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons at low energies, where the details of the high-energy behavior can be integrated out. One of the most well-known EFTs for QCD is called Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), which is based on the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD in the low-energy regime.\n\nTo calculate the coefficients of the effective theory, one starts with the QCD Lagrangian, which is given by:\n\nL_QCD = - (1/4) G^a_{μν} G^{aμν} + ∑_f (q̄_f (iγ^μ D_μ - m_f) q_f)\n\nHere, G^a_{μν} is the gluon field strength tensor, q_f represents the quark fields, m_f is the quark mass, and D_μ is the covariant derivative. The sum runs over all quark flavors f.\n\nThe next step is to identify the relevant degrees of freedom for the low-energy regime. In ChPT, these are the Goldstone bosons (pions, kaons, and etas) that arise due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The effective Lagrangian is then constructed as an expansion in powers of the Goldstone boson fields and their derivatives, with coefficients that are functions of the quark masses and the QCD coupling constant.\n\nTo determine these coefficients, one can use a technique called \"matching,\" which involves comparing the predictions of the full QCD theory and the effective theory at a certain energy scale. By demanding that both theories give the same results for certain observables (such as scattering amplitudes), one can fix the coefficients of the effective Lagrangian.\n\nAn example of the application of the effective field theory technique to a physical system governed by QCD is the calculation of the pion-pion scattering amplitude at low energies. In ChPT, the leading-order contribution to this amplitude comes from the tree-level exchange of pions, which can be computed using the effective Lagrangian. By comparing this result with the full QCD calculation (which is usually done using lattice QCD techniques), one can extract the values of the low-energy constants that appear in the ChPT Lagrangian. These constants can then be used to make predictions for other low-energy observables, such as the pion decay constant or the masses of the Goldstone bosons."
