    "message_2": "Brewster's law states that the angle of incidence (θi) at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection, is given by:\n\ntan(θi) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media (in this case, air and glass), and θi is the angle of incidence.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the angle of reflection (50 degrees) with respect to the normal, which is equal to the angle of incidence (θi) due to the law of reflection. We are also given the index of refraction of the glass (n2) as 1.5. The index of refraction of air (n1) is approximately 1.\n\nUsing Brewster's law:\n\ntan(θi) = 1.5 / 1\ntan(θi) = 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle of incidence (θi) by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of 1.5:\n\nθi = arctan(1.5)\nθi ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of incidence of light when it reflects off a glass surface at an angle of 50 degrees with respect to the normal and the reflected light is completely polarized is approximately 56.31 degrees."
