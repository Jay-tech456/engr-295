    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum energy required for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to detect a Z' boson with a mass of 2 TeV, we need to consider the production rate of the Z' boson. The production rate (R) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR = L * σ\n\nwhere L is the luminosity (10^34 cm^-2s^-1) and σ is the production cross section (1 pb).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the cross section from picobarns (pb) to cm^2. 1 pb = 10^-36 cm^2. So, σ = 1 * 10^-36 cm^2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the production rate:\n\nR = (10^34 cm^-2s^-1) * (10^-36 cm^2) = 10^-2 s^-1\n\nThis means that one Z' boson is produced every 100 seconds.\n\nSince the center-of-mass energy of the LHC is 14 TeV, we can calculate the minimum energy required to detect the Z' boson by considering the ratio of the Z' boson mass to the center-of-mass energy:\n\nMinimum energy required = (Z' boson mass) / (center-of-mass energy) = (2 TeV) / (14 TeV) = 1/7\n\nSo, the minimum energy required for the LHC to detect a Z' boson with a mass of 2 TeV is 1/7 or approximately 14.3% of the center-of-mass energy."
