    "message_2": "Total internal reflection occurs when light passes from a medium with a higher index of refraction (n1) to a medium with a lower index of refraction (n2) and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90°)\n\nSince the index of refraction for air is approximately 1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.5 * sin(θc) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nsin(θc) = 1 / 1.5\n\nθc = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nθc ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence required for total internal reflection to occur at the interface between a medium with an index of refraction of 1.5 and air is approximately 41.81°."
