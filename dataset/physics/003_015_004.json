    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment, then multiply by 4 since the magnetic field contribution from each segment is the same.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The length of the segment is 0.2 m. We can divide this segment into small current elements dl. Let's consider a small current element dl at a distance x from the center of the segment. The distance from the current element to the center of the loop is:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + (0.2/2)²)\n\nThe angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the length of the segment (from -0.1 to 0.1) gives the total magnetic field due to one segment:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dl * r) / r³ dx from -0.1 to 0.1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = r², so du = 2x dx. The integral becomes:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * (1/2) * ∫ du / u² from u1 to u2\n\nwhere u1 = (-0.1)² + (0.1)² and u2 = (0.1)² + (0.1)².\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * (1/2) * [-1/u] from u1 to u2\n\nB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * (1/2) * (-1/u2 + 1/u1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, u1, and u2:\n\nB_segment = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * 2 A * (1/2) * (-1/(0.02) + 1/(0.01))\n\nB_segment = (10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 2 A * (1/2) * (-1/0.02 + 1/0.01)\n\nB_segment = (10⁻⁷ T) * (-50 + 100)\n\nB_segment = 50 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSince there are four segments in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center of the loop is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_segment\n\nB_total = 4 * 50 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB_total = 200 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB_total = 2 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 2 × 10⁻⁵ T."
