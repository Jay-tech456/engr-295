How does the radius of the event horizon change with increased mass of the black hole, and what implications does this have for the gravitational influence of the black hole on surrounding matter?",
    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole and the size of its event horizon can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole and is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the radius of the event horizon is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. This means that as the mass of the black hole increases, the size of its event horizon also increases.\n\nAs the radius of the event horizon increases with the mass of the black hole, the gravitational influence of the black hole on surrounding matter also increases. This is because the event horizon marks the boundary within which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, meaning that anything that crosses the event horizon, including light, cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull.\n\nAs the event horizon expands, the region of space from which matter and energy cannot escape grows larger, and the black hole's gravitational influence becomes stronger. This can lead to the accretion of more matter and energy, causing the black hole to grow even larger and further increasing its gravitational influence. This process can continue, potentially leading to the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that outside the event horizon, the gravitational influence of a black hole is no different from that of any other object with the same mass. So, if the Sun were to be replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the orbits of the planets in our solar system would remain unchanged."
