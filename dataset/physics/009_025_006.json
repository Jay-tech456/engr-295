    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the critical angle of incidence for a glass core optical fiber whose core refractive index is 1.45 and cladding refractive index is 1.42. The student has to use the formula for critical angle of incidence (θc = sin^-1(n2/n1)) where n1 is the refractive index of the core and n2 is the refractive index of the cladding. The student must express the angle in degrees and provide their answer rounded to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle of incidence for the glass core optical fiber, we will use the formula provided:\n\nθc = sin^-1(n2/n1)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the core (1.45) and n2 is the refractive index of the cladding (1.42).\n\nθc = sin^-1(1.42/1.45)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the ratio of the refractive indices:\n\n1.42/1.45 ≈ 0.97931\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine of this value:\n\nθc = sin^-1(0.97931)\n\nθc ≈ 78.46°\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for the glass core optical fiber is approximately 78.46°, rounded to two decimal places."
