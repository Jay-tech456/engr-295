    "message_2": "To determine the maximum distance for secure quantum key distribution (QKD), we need to consider several factors, including the specific QKD protocol being used, the efficiency of the quantum channel, the detectors' performance, and the error rates. The most common QKD protocols are BB84 and E91.\n\nIn general, the maximum distance for QKD is limited by the signal attenuation in the quantum channel (usually an optical fiber) and the efficiency of single-photon detectors. As the distance increases, the probability of detecting a single photon decreases, leading to higher error rates and lower secure key generation rates.\n\nCurrently, commercial QKD systems can achieve secure key distribution over distances of around 100-200 kilometers using standard telecom fibers. Some experimental setups have demonstrated QKD over distances of more than 300 kilometers.\n\nHowever, to extend the range of QKD, researchers are developing new technologies such as quantum repeaters and satellite-based QKD. Quantum repeaters can potentially increase the maximum distance for QKD by reducing the signal attenuation, while satellite-based QKD can enable global-scale secure key distribution.\n\nIn summary, the maximum distance for secure quantum key distribution depends on the specific QKD protocol, the quantum channel's efficiency, and the detectors' performance. With current technologies, this distance is typically around 100-200 kilometers, but ongoing research aims to extend this range significantly."
