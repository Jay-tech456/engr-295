    "message_2": "The rate of growth of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the rate of star formation in the surrounding galaxy are interconnected processes. The growth of a SMBH is primarily due to the accretion of gas and the merging of other black holes, while star formation in the galaxy occurs when the gas in the galaxy cools and collapses under gravity.\n\nThe rate of growth of a SMBH can be quantified using the Eddington accretion rate, which is the maximum rate at which a black hole can grow without producing so much radiation that it pushes away the infalling gas. The Eddington accretion rate is given by:\n\nṀ_edd = 4πGMm_p / (εσ_Tc)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, m_p is the proton mass, ε is the efficiency of converting mass to energy, σ_T is the Thomson cross-section, and c is the speed of light.\n\nObservations of SMBHs in nearby galaxies suggest that their growth rates are typically much lower than the Eddington rate, with most SMBHs growing at only a few percent of the Eddington rate. This is because the gas supply in the galaxy is often not sufficient to sustain the maximum growth rate.\n\nThe rate of star formation in a galaxy can be estimated using the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, which relates the surface density of star formation (Σ_SFR) to the surface density of gas (Σ_gas):\n\nΣ_SFR ∝ Σ_gas^N\n\nwhere N is typically around 1.4. Observations of star-forming galaxies show that the star formation rate can range from a few solar masses per year in low-mass galaxies to hundreds or even thousands of solar masses per year in massive, starburst galaxies.\n\nComparing the growth rates of SMBHs and star formation in galaxies, it is clear that the rate of star formation is generally much higher than the rate of SMBH growth. This is supported by observations of the cosmic star formation history and the growth of SMBHs over cosmic time. The peak of cosmic star formation occurred around 10 billion years ago, while the peak of SMBH growth occurred slightly later, around 8 billion years ago. The overall growth of SMBHs is much less than the total mass of stars formed in galaxies, indicating that SMBH growth is a relatively small fraction of the total baryonic mass assembly in galaxies.\n\nIn conclusion, the rate of growth of a supermassive black hole is typically much lower than the rate of star formation in the surrounding galaxy. Observations and modeling of galaxies and their central black holes support this conclusion, with the growth of SMBHs being a relatively small fraction of the total mass assembly in galaxies."
