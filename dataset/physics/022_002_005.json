    "message_2": "The estimated percentage of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27%. This conclusion is supported by various lines of evidence, including:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation speeds of stars in galaxies show that they do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass distribution. The outer stars in galaxies rotate faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These maps reveal that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, indicating the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB can be used to determine the composition of the universe. Analyses of the CMB data indicate that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of the universe's evolution, including the effects of dark matter, produce structures that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n5. The Bullet Cluster: This is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters, where the visible matter (mostly gas) has been separated from the majority of the mass (as inferred from gravitational lensing). This provides direct evidence for the existence of dark matter, as the majority of the mass cannot be accounted for by the visible matter alone.\n\nThese lines of evidence, along with others, have led to the widely accepted conclusion that dark matter makes up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe."
