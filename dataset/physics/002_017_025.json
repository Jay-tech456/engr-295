    "message_2": "To find the critical pressure of water at a temperature of 374°C, we can use the critical point relationship, which is given by:\n\nPc = R * Tc / Vc\n\nwhere Pc is the critical pressure, R is the universal gas constant, Tc is the critical temperature, and Vc is the critical volume.\n\nGiven:\nTc = 374°C = 374 + 273.15 = 647.15 K (converting to Kelvin)\nVc = 0.00316 m³/mol\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (universal gas constant)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nPc = (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (647.15 K) / (0.00316 m³/mol)\n\nPc = 1693.26 J/m³\n\nTo convert the pressure from J/m³ to atm, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 atm = 101325 J/m³\n\nPc = 1693.26 J/m³ * (1 atm / 101325 J/m³)\n\nPc = 16.71 atm\n\nRounded off to two decimal places, the critical pressure of water at a temperature of 374°C is 16.71 atm."
