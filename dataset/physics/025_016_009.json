    "message_2": "To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate in human cells, we need to know the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for each of the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The standard Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = Σ(ΔGf° of products) - Σ(ΔGf° of reactants)\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation values for the compounds involved in the reaction at 37°C (310.15 K) and pH 7.4 are as follows (in kJ/mol):\n\nGlucose: -910.3\nADP: -1466.6\nPi (inorganic phosphate): -1059.2\nPyruvate: -499.0\nATP: -2298.3\nH2O: -237.1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG° = [2(-499.0) + 2(-2298.3) + 2(-237.1)] - [-910.3 + 2(-1466.6) + 2(-1059.2)]\n\nΔG° = [-998.0 - 4596.6 - 474.2] - [-910.3 - 2933.2 - 2118.4]\n\nΔG° = [-6068.8] - [-5961.9]\n\nΔG° = -106.9 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate in human cells at 37°C and pH 7.4 is -106.9 kJ/mol."
