    "message_2": "The Klein-Gordon equation for a free particle in one dimension is given by:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∂²/∂x²)ψ(x,t) = m²ψ(x,t)\n\nwhere ψ(x,t) is the wave function of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, and x and t are the position and time coordinates, respectively.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the Fourier transform method. First, we take the Fourier transform of ψ(x,t) with respect to x:\n\nψ(k,t) = ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ(x,t) dx\n\nwhere k is the wave number. Now, we can rewrite the Klein-Gordon equation in terms of the Fourier-transformed wave function:\n\n(∂²/∂t² + k² + m²)ψ(k,t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation in time, which has the general solution:\n\nψ(k,t) = A(k) e^(-iω(k)t) + B(k) e^(iω(k)t)\n\nwhere ω(k) = sqrt(k² + m²) and A(k) and B(k) are arbitrary functions of k that will be determined by the initial conditions.\n\nNow, let's consider the given initial conditions:\n\nψ(x,0) = ψ₀(x)\n∂ψ(x,0)/∂t = ψ₁(x)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of these initial conditions, we get:\n\nψ(k,0) = ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₀(x) dx\n∂ψ(k,0)/∂t = ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₁(x) dx\n\nUsing these transformed initial conditions, we can determine A(k) and B(k):\n\nA(k) + B(k) = ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₀(x) dx\n-iω(k)A(k) + iω(k)B(k) = ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₁(x) dx\n\nSolving for A(k) and B(k), we get:\n\nA(k) = (1/2) [∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₀(x) dx + (1/ω(k)) ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₁(x) dx]\nB(k) = (1/2) [∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₀(x) dx - (1/ω(k)) ∫ e^(-ikx) ψ₁(x) dx]\n\nFinally, we can obtain the solution ψ(x,t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of ψ(k,t):\n\nψ(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫ e^(ikx) [A(k) e^(-iω(k)t) + B(k) e^(iω(k)t)] dk\n\nThis is the general solution to the Klein-Gordon equation for a free particle in one dimension with given initial conditions ψ₀(x) and ψ₁(x)."
