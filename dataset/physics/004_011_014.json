    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric is a solution to Einstein's field equations that describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is its electric charge, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates.\n\nTo analyze the event horizon and singularity of a black hole, we need to find the values of r for which the metric becomes singular. This occurs when the coefficient of dr² in the metric becomes infinite, which is when the denominator (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²) equals zero.\n\n1 - 2M/r + Q²/r² = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr² - 2Mr + Q² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (2M ± √(4M² - 4Q²))/2\n\nr = M ± √(M² - Q²)\n\nThere are two solutions for r, which correspond to the inner (r-) and outer (r+) event horizons:\n\nr- = M - √(M² - Q²)\nr+ = M + √(M² - Q²)\n\nFor the singularity, we need to find the values of r for which the metric tensor components become infinite. In the Reissner-Nordström metric, this occurs when r = 0. Thus, the singularity is located at r = 0.\n\nNow let's compare these results to the Schwarzschild metric for uncharged black holes. The Schwarzschild metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r)dt² + (1 - 2M/r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nThe event horizon is found by setting the denominator (1 - 2M/r) equal to zero:\n\n1 - 2M/r = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = 2M\n\nIn the Schwarzschild case, there is only one event horizon, and it is located at r = 2M. The singularity is also located at r = 0, just like in the Reissner-Nordström case.\n\nIn summary, the electric charge affects the event horizon and singularity of a black hole according to the Reissner-Nordström metric by introducing two event horizons (inner and outer) instead of just one in the Schwarzschild case. The singularity remains at r = 0 in both cases."
