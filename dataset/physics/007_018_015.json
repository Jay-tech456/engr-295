    "message_1": "What is the half-life of Uranium-235, given that its decay constant is 9.85 x 10^-10 s^-1? Calculate the time required for the decay of 75% of the initial amount of Uranium-235. Use the formula N(t) = N0e^(-λt), where N(t) is the amount of Uranium-235 remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount of Uranium-235 and λ is the decay constant.",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of Uranium-235, we can use the relationship between the decay constant (λ) and half-life (T_half):\n\nT_half = ln(2) / λ\n\nGiven the decay constant λ = 9.85 x 10^-10 s^-1, we can calculate the half-life:\n\nT_half = ln(2) / (9.85 x 10^-10 s^-1) ≈ 7.04 x 10^8 s\n\nNow, to find the time required for the decay of 75% of the initial amount of Uranium-235, we can use the decay formula N(t) = N0e^(-λt). Since 75% has decayed, 25% remains:\n\n0.25 = e^(-λt)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = -λt\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(0.25) / (-λ) ≈ 2.77 x 10^9 s\n\nSo, the half-life of Uranium-235 is approximately 7.04 x 10^8 seconds, and the time required for the decay of 75% of the initial amount of Uranium-235 is approximately 2.77 x 10^9 seconds."
