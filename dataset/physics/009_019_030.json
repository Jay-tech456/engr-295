    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the condition for bright fringes (constructive interference) is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order bright fringe, m is the order of the bright fringe, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance between the screen and the slits (1.5 meters) and the angle θ (30 degrees) for the second-order bright fringe (m = 2). We need to find the distance d between the two slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength of the light. To do this, we can use the small-angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the m-th order bright fringe on the screen, and L is the distance between the screen and the slits (1.5 meters).\n\nFor θ = 30 degrees, we have:\n\ntan(30) ≈ y / 1.5\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny ≈ 1.5 * tan(30) ≈ 1.5 * (1 / sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.866 meters\n\nNow, we can use the condition for bright fringes to find the wavelength:\n\nd * sin(30) = 2 * λ\n\nλ = (d * sin(30)) / 2\n\nSince we know y and L, we can use the small-angle approximation to find sin(30):\n\nsin(30) ≈ y / L ≈ 0.866 / 1.5 ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the equation for λ:\n\nλ = (d * 0.577) / 2\n\nWe have one equation with one unknown (d). However, we need more information to solve for d, such as the wavelength of the light used in the experiment. Once we have the wavelength, we can solve for d using the equation above."
