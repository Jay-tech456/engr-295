    "message_2": "To calculate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by two black holes merging, we can use the following formulas derived from the general theory of relativity:\n\n1. Frequency (f) of the gravitational waves during the inspiral phase:\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96)^(3/8) * (π * M_chirp)^(-5/8) * (t_c - t)^(-3/8)\n\n2. Amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves:\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp / c^2) * (π * f * G * M_chirp / c^3)^(-2/3) * (D_L)^(-1)\n\nHere, \nc = speed of light ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s\nG = gravitational constant ≈ 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nM_chirp = chirp mass of the binary system\nt_c = time of coalescence\nt = time before coalescence\nD_L = luminosity distance\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the chirp mass (M_chirp) of the binary system:\nM_chirp = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nGiven that each black hole has a mass of 30 solar masses, we have:\nm1 = m2 = 30 * M_sun, where M_sun = solar mass ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nM_chirp = ((30 * M_sun)^2)^(3/5) / (60 * M_sun)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 24.74 * M_sun ≈ 4.92 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance of 1 billion light-years to meters:\n1 light-year ≈ 9.461 x 10^15 m\n1 billion light-years ≈ 1 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 m ≈ 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (f) and amplitude (h) of the gravitational waves:\n\n1. Frequency (f):\nFor simplicity, let's consider the frequency at the time of coalescence (t = t_c). In this case, the frequency formula simplifies to:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96)^(3/8) * (π * M_chirp)^(-5/8)\nf ≈ 134 Hz\n\n2. Amplitude (h):\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp / c^2) * (π * f * G * M_chirp / c^3)^(-2/3) * (9.461 x 10^24 m)^(-1)\nh ≈ 1.3 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the merging black holes is approximately 134 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.3 x 10^-22."
