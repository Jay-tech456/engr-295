    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the amount of heat energy (in Joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- Q = 250 Joules\n- m = 50 g\n- Initial temperature (T1) = 25°C\n- Final temperature (T2) = 75°C\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 75°C - 25°C\nΔT = 50°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc = 250 J / (50 g × 50°C)\nc = 250 J / 2500 g°C\nc = 0.1 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of copper is 0.1 J/g°C."
