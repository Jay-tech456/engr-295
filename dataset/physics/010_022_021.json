    "message_2": "First, we need to find the mass of the oil spilled. We are given the volume of the oil spill (1000 liters) and the oil density (900 kg/m³). To calculate the mass, we need to convert the volume from liters to cubic meters:\n\n1 liter = 0.001 m³\n1000 liters = 1000 * 0.001 m³ = 1 m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of the oil spilled:\n\nmass = volume * density\nmass = 1 m³ * 900 kg/m³ = 900 kg\n\nNow, let's find the rate of oil spill transport. We are given the river velocity (1 m/s) and the width of the river (10 m). The oil spill duration is 2 hours. To find the rate of oil spill transport, we need to calculate the distance the oil spill travels during the spill duration:\n\ntime = 2 hours = 2 * 3600 seconds = 7200 seconds\n\ndistance = velocity * time\ndistance = 1 m/s * 7200 s = 7200 m\n\nNow, we can find the rate of oil spill transport:\n\nrate = distance / time\nrate = 7200 m / 7200 s = 1 m/s\n\nSo, the rate of oil spill transport in the river is 1 m/s.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of oil transported during the spill. Since the entire volume of the oil spill (1000 liters) is transported during the spill duration, the mass of oil transported is the same as the mass of the oil spilled:\n\nmass of oil transported = 900 kg"
