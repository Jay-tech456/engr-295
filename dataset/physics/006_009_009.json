    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength after Compton scattering, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ' is the scattered photon's wavelength, λ is the initial photon's wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron's mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle (60 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial wavelength (λ) of the 20 keV X-ray photon. We can use the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon. Convert 20 keV to Joules:\n\n20 keV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.204 x 10^-15 J\n\nNow, we can find the initial wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.204 x 10^-15 J) = 6.199 x 10^-11 m\n\nNext, we can use the Compton formula to find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / [(9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)] * (1 - cos(60°))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / [(9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)] * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ = 2.426 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the change in wavelength of the 20 keV X-ray photon after undergoing Compton scattering with a stationary electron in a carbon atom and being detected at an angle of 60 degrees relative to the incident photon is approximately 2.426 x 10^-12 meters."
