    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the refrigerator, we need to use the Coefficient of Performance (COP) formula for refrigerators, which is:\n\nCOP = Desired Output (cooling effect) / Required Input (work done)\n\nThe desired output is the heat removed from the refrigerator, and the required input is the work done by the refrigerator, which is given as 500 W.\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat removed from the refrigerator. To do this, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula for refrigerators:\n\nCarnot Efficiency = (T_cold) / (T_hot - T_cold)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature inside the refrigerator (-10°C) and T_hot is the temperature of the room (25°C). Note that we need to convert these temperatures to Kelvin:\n\nT_cold = -10°C + 273.15 = 263.15 K\nT_hot = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCarnot Efficiency = (263.15 K) / (298.15 K - 263.15 K) = 263.15 / 35 = 7.518\n\nThe actual refrigerator cannot be more efficient than the Carnot efficiency. So, let's assume the refrigerator is operating at its maximum efficiency. In this case, the COP will be equal to the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCOP = 7.518\n\nNow, we can find the desired output (cooling effect):\n\nCooling Effect = COP * Required Input\nCooling Effect = 7.518 * 500 W = 3759 W\n\nFinally, we can calculate the efficiency of the refrigerator:\n\nEfficiency = (Desired Output / Total Output) * 100\nEfficiency = (Cooling Effect / (Cooling Effect + Required Input)) * 100\nEfficiency = (3759 W / (3759 W + 500 W)) * 100\nEfficiency = (3759 / 4259) * 100 ≈ 88.25%\n\nThe efficiency of the refrigerator is approximately 88.25%."
