    "message_2": "To derive the effective field theory (EFT) of a non-relativistic interacting Bose gas in the presence of a time-varying external potential up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the 1/N expansion, we start with the Lagrangian density of the system. The Lagrangian density for a non-relativistic Bose gas with N scalar fields φ_i (i = 1, 2, ..., N) in an external potential V(x,t) can be written as:\n\nL = ∑_i [ (i/2) (φ_i* ∂_t φ_i - φ_i ∂_t φ_i*) - (∇φ_i*)·(∇φ_i) - m^2 |φ_i|^2 - λ (|φ_i|^2)^2 ] - V(x,t) ∑_i |φ_i|^2\n\nHere, m is the mass of the bosons, λ is the interaction strength, and V(x,t) is the time-varying external potential.\n\nTo proceed with the 1/N expansion, we introduce a Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary field σ(x,t) and rewrite the Lagrangian density as:\n\nL = ∑_i [ (i/2) (φ_i* ∂_t φ_i - φ_i ∂_t φ_i*) - (∇φ_i*)·(∇φ_i) - m^2 |φ_i|^2 - (σ/N) |φ_i|^2 ] - (N/4λ) σ^2 - V(x,t) ∑_i |φ_i|^2\n\nNow, we perform the 1/N expansion by introducing a large-N saddle-point approximation. We first find the saddle-point equations by taking the functional derivatives of the action with respect to φ_i*, φ_i, and σ, and setting them to zero. We then solve these equations perturbatively in 1/N.\n\nAt leading order (LO) in 1/N, we find the mean-field equations:\n\n∂_t φ_i = -i [ -∇^2 + m^2 + σ/N + V(x,t) ] φ_i\n\nσ = 2λ ∑_i |φ_i|^2\n\nAt next-to-leading order (NLO) in 1/N, we need to consider fluctuations around the saddle-point solutions. We introduce small fluctuations δφ_i and δσ and expand the Lagrangian density to quadratic order in these fluctuations. This will give us the EFT for the non-relativistic interacting Bose gas in the presence of a time-varying external potential up to NLO in the 1/N expansion.\n\nThe resulting EFT will involve the LO mean-field solutions and the NLO fluctuation terms, which will describe the collective excitations and interactions of the Bose gas in the presence of the external potential. This EFT can then be used to study various properties of the system, such as the response to the time-varying potential, the correlation functions, and the transport coefficients."
