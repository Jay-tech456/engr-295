    "message_2": "The precision of measurements of the Higgs boson's mass and decay width is significantly affected by the detector resolution. Detector resolution refers to the ability of a detector to distinguish between two closely spaced events or particles. A higher resolution detector can more accurately measure the properties of particles, such as their mass and decay width.\n\n1. Mass measurement:\n\nThe Higgs boson's mass is determined by analyzing the invariant mass distribution of its decay products. The better the detector resolution, the more accurately the mass of the Higgs boson can be measured. A high-resolution detector can distinguish between closely spaced events in the invariant mass distribution, leading to a more precise measurement of the Higgs boson's mass.\n\nFor example, in the case of the Higgs boson decaying into two photons (H→γγ), the mass resolution is mainly determined by the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter. A better energy resolution will result in a narrower peak in the invariant mass distribution, allowing for a more precise measurement of the Higgs boson's mass.\n\n2. Decay width measurement:\n\nThe decay width of the Higgs boson is related to its lifetime and is an important parameter for understanding its properties and interactions. A high-resolution detector is crucial for accurately measuring the decay width, as it allows for a more precise determination of the decay products' momenta and energies.\n\nFor example, in the case of the Higgs boson decaying into four leptons (H→4l), the decay width can be measured by analyzing the distribution of the four-lepton invariant mass. A high-resolution detector can more accurately measure the momenta of the leptons, leading to a more precise determination of the decay width.\n\nIn summary, different detector resolutions have a significant impact on the precision measurements of the Higgs boson's mass and decay width. A higher resolution detector allows for more accurate measurements of the Higgs boson's properties, which is crucial for understanding its role in the Standard Model of particle physics and for searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model."
