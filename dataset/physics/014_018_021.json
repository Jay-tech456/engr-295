    "message_2": "The maximum safe duration of exposure to cosmic radiation for astronauts on a mission to Mars depends on several factors, including the shielding technology used, solar activity, and individual susceptibility to radiation. \n\nIn general, the current guidelines provided by NASA limit astronauts' career exposure to ionizing radiation to a 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) from cancer. This limit varies depending on age, sex, and other factors, but it typically translates to a dose limit of around 1 sievert (Sv) for a Mars mission.\n\nA round trip to Mars, including time spent on the Martian surface, is estimated to take about 2-3 years. During this time, astronauts would be exposed to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle events (SPEs). GCR exposure is relatively constant, while SPEs are sporadic and can cause a sudden increase in radiation levels.\n\nWith the current state of technology and shielding, it is estimated that astronauts would receive a dose of about 0.3 Sv per year from GCRs. This means that a 2-3 year mission to Mars would result in a dose of 0.6-0.9 Sv, which is close to the 1 Sv limit set by NASA. However, this does not account for the potential exposure to SPEs, which could significantly increase the radiation dose.\n\nIn conclusion, with the current state of technology and knowledge, a mission to Mars would be close to the maximum safe duration of exposure to cosmic radiation. However, improvements in shielding technology and a better understanding of the effects of high-energy particles on human tissue could potentially increase the safe duration of exposure in the future."
