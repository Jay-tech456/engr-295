    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Ideal Gas Law equation: PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of air and nitrogen gas. We'll use the molar mass of air (approximately 29 g/mol) and nitrogen gas (28 g/mol).\n\nFor air:\nmass_air = 500 g\nmolar_mass_air = 29 g/mol\nn_air = mass_air / molar_mass_air\nn_air = 500 g / 29 g/mol ≈ 17.24 mol\n\nFor nitrogen gas:\nmass_N2 = 200 g\nmolar_mass_N2 = 28 g/mol\nn_N2 = mass_N2 / molar_mass_N2\nn_N2 = 200 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol\n\nNow, let's find the total number of moles in the container:\nn_total = n_air + n_N2\nn_total = 17.24 mol + 7.14 mol = 24.38 mol\n\nNext, we'll convert the initial temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\nT_initial = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nWe know the initial pressure (P_initial) is 1 atm. We can now find the initial volume (V_initial) using the Ideal Gas Law equation for the air before adding nitrogen gas:\n\nP_initial * V_initial = n_air * R * T_initial\nV_initial = (n_air * R * T_initial) / P_initial\n\nWe'll use the value of R = 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) for our calculations:\n\nV_initial = (17.24 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 298.15 K) / 1 atm ≈ 420.10 L\n\nNow, let's find the final pressure (P_final) and temperature (T_final) of the gas mixture. Since the problem statement does not mention any change in temperature, we can assume that the temperature remains constant at 298.15 K. \n\nWe can now use the Ideal Gas Law equation to find the final pressure:\n\nP_final * V_initial = n_total * R * T_final\nP_final = (n_total * R * T_final) / V_initial\n\nP_final = (24.38 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (mol K) * 298.15 K) / 420.10 L ≈ 1.45 atm\n\nSo, the final pressure is approximately 1.45 atm. The final volume remains the same as the initial volume, which is 420.10 L. The final temperature remains constant at 298.15 K (or 25°C).\n\nIn summary, the final pressure is 1.45 atm, the final volume is 420.10 L, and the final temperature is 298.15 K (25°C)."
