    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a material is the temperature below which it exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism. The value of Tc depends on the specific material and its composition. For conventional superconductors, Tc is usually below 30 K (-243 °C), while for high-temperature superconductors, Tc can be as high as 138 K (-135 °C).\n\nThe presence of impurities can significantly affect the superconducting properties of a material. Impurities can be classified into two types: magnetic and non-magnetic impurities.\n\n1. Magnetic impurities: These impurities can disrupt the formation of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for superconductivity. The presence of magnetic impurities can lead to a decrease in Tc and may even suppress superconductivity altogether. This effect is known as the Abrikosov-Gor'kov effect.\n\n2. Non-magnetic impurities: These impurities can also affect the superconducting properties of a material, but their impact is generally less severe than that of magnetic impurities. Non-magnetic impurities can cause scattering of electrons, which can lead to a decrease in Tc. However, this effect is usually less pronounced than the effect of magnetic impurities.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature of a material for it to exhibit superconductivity depends on the specific material and its composition. The presence of impurities, particularly magnetic impurities, can negatively affect the superconducting properties of a material by decreasing its critical temperature or even suppressing superconductivity altogether."
