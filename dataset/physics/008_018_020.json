    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.\n\nThe ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has measured the strong coupling constant at various energy scales. One of the most recent measurements by the ATLAS collaboration is at the Z boson mass scale (mZ ≈ 91.2 GeV). The result is:\n\nαs(mZ) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011 (experimental uncertainty) ± 0.0015 (theoretical uncertainty)\n\nThis value is consistent with the current world average and other experimental measurements at the LHC and other colliders. The theoretical prediction for the strong coupling constant based on QCD and the global analysis of experimental data is:\n\nαs(mZ) = 0.1183 ± 0.0007\n\nAs we can see, the ATLAS measurement is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction based on QCD. This consistency supports the validity of QCD as the correct theory describing the strong force and its interactions. However, it is essential to continue refining both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations to improve our understanding of the strong force and its role in the fundamental interactions of the universe."
