    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K). The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the time when the universe was very hot and dense, shortly after the Big Bang. The existence of the CMB supports the Big Bang theory because it is a remnant of the early universe and its uniformity across the sky is consistent with the idea that the universe expanded rapidly from a hot, dense state.\n\nTo calculate the wavelength of the peak intensity of the radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states:\n\nλ_max * T = b\n\nwhere λ_max is the wavelength of the peak intensity, T is the temperature of the black body (in this case, the CMB), and b is Wien's displacement constant, approximately equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven the temperature of the CMB (T = 2.725 K), we can calculate the wavelength of the peak intensity:\n\nλ_max = b / T\nλ_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / (2.725 K)\nλ_max ≈ 1.063 x 10^-3 m\n\nThe wavelength of the peak intensity is approximately 1.063 x 10^-3 meters, or 1.063 millimeters. This falls within the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is why it is called the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThe significance of the peak wavelength is that it provides evidence for the temperature and age of the universe. The fact that the peak wavelength falls within the microwave range indicates that the universe has cooled down significantly since the Big Bang, as the radiation has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. This observation is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory and helps to confirm our understanding of the early universe and its evolution."
