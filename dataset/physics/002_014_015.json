    "message_1": "A refrigerator works by removing heat from a cold space and transferring it to a hot space. The efficiency of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of heat removed from the cold space to the work done on the system. A refrigerator with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.5 is designed to remove 5 kJ of heat from a cold space each cycle. What is the amount of work required by the refrigerator in each cycle?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is given by the formula:\n\nCOP = Heat removed from the cold space / Work done on the system\n\nWe are given the COP as 4.5 and the heat removed from the cold space as 5 kJ. We need to find the work done on the system. Let's denote the work done as W. Rearranging the formula, we get:\n\nW = Heat removed from the cold space / COP\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nW = 5 kJ / 4.5\n\nW â‰ˆ 1.11 kJ\n\nSo, the amount of work required by the refrigerator in each cycle is approximately 1.11 kJ."
