    "message_2": "To find the image distance (v) formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven that the focal length (f) of the concave lens is -20 cm (negative since it's a concave lens) and the object distance (u) is -15 cm (negative since the object is on the same side as the incoming light), we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-20) - 1/(-15)\n1/v = (-15 + 20) / (15 * 20)\n1/v = 5 / 300\nv = 300 / 5\nv = 60 cm\n\nThe image is formed 60 cm from the lens. Since the value is positive, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) of the image using the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nm = -60 / (-15)\nm = 4\n\nThe magnification of the image is 4, which means the image is 4 times larger than the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright."
