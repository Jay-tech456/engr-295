    "message_1": "A rectangular loop with sides of length 10 cm and 5 cm carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point located 4 cm away from one of its shorter sides, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 4 cm away from one of the shorter sides, we will use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can break it down into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment. Then, we can sum up the contributions to find the total magnetic field.\n\nLet's label the corners of the rectangle as A, B, C, and D, with A and B being the shorter sides. The point of interest (P) is 4 cm away from side AB, perpendicular to the plane of the loop.\n\n1. Contribution from side AB:\nSince the point P is in the plane of the loop and perpendicular to side AB, the magnetic field contribution from side AB will be zero.\n\n2. Contribution from side BC:\nThe magnetic field contribution from side BC will be perpendicular to the plane containing side BC and the line connecting the midpoint of side BC to point P. The angle between this plane and the plane of the loop is 90 degrees, so the magnetic field contribution from side BC will be in the plane of the loop.\n\n3. Contribution from side CD:\nThe magnetic field contribution from side CD will be in the same direction as that from side BC, as they are symmetrical with respect to point P.\n\n4. Contribution from side DA:\nThe magnetic field contribution from side DA will also be in the same direction as that from side BC and side CD, as they are symmetrical with respect to point P.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field contribution from side BC (which will be the same for side CD and side DA).\n\nFor side BC, the length dl is along the y-axis, and the position vector r is in the xz-plane. The angle between dl and r is 90 degrees. So, the cross product dl x r will be along the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the loop).\n\nLet's integrate the Biot-Savart Law along side BC:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl * sin(90) / r^3) dr\n\nThe limits of integration are from r = 4 cm to r = 4 + 10 = 14 cm. The current I = 2 A.\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 2 * ∫(dl / r^3) dr [from r = 4 cm to r = 14 cm]\n\nB = (2 * 10^(-7)) * (1/4 - 1/14^3)\n\nB = (2 * 10^(-7)) * (1/4 - 1/2744)\n\nB = (2 * 10^(-7)) * (685/2744)\n\nB = 5 * 10^(-8) T\n\nSince the contributions from side CD and side DA are the same, the total magnetic field at point P is:\n\nB_total = 3 * B = 3 * 5 * 10^(-8) T = 15 * 10^(-8) T = 1.5 * 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop and in the same direction as the cross product dl x r (along the z-axis).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is 1.5 * 10^(-6) T, and the direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop (along the z-axis)."
