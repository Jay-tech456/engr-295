    "message_1": "A spaceship travels at a speed of 0.95c relative to Earth. At time t=0 according to Earth's frame of reference, a clock on the spaceship reads 10:00:00. What time is it according to Earth's frame of reference when the spaceship passes a nearby star located 40 light-years away from Earth? Use Lorentz transformations of coordinates and time to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first need to find the time it takes for the spaceship to travel 40 light-years according to its own frame of reference. Then, we'll use the Lorentz transformation to find the corresponding time in Earth's frame of reference.\n\n1. Find the time it takes for the spaceship to travel 40 light-years in its own frame of reference.\n\nThe spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.95c, where c is the speed of light. To find the time it takes to travel 40 light-years, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\ntime = 40 light-years / 0.95c\n\ntime ≈ 42.11 years\n\nSo, in the spaceship's frame of reference, it takes approximately 42.11 years to travel 40 light-years.\n\n2. Use the Lorentz transformation to find the corresponding time in Earth's frame of reference.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for time is given by:\n\nt' = γ(t - (vx/c²))\n\nwhere t' is the time in the moving frame (spaceship), t is the time in the stationary frame (Earth), v is the relative velocity (0.95c), x is the distance (40 light-years), and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²)\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.95c/c)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.95²)\nγ ≈ 3.20\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation for time:\n\nt' = 42.11 years (time in the spaceship's frame of reference)\nx = 40 light-years\nv = 0.95c\n\nt = (t' + (vx/c²)) / γ\nt = (42.11 years + (0.95c * 40 light-years / c²)) / 3.20\nt = (42.11 years + (0.95 * 40 years)) / 3.20\nt ≈ 134.74 years\n\nSo, according to Earth's frame of reference, it takes approximately 134.74 years for the spaceship to pass the nearby star.\n\nSince the clock on the spaceship reads 10:00:00 at t=0, we can find the time when the spaceship passes the star by adding 134.74 years to the initial time:\n\n10:00:00 + 134.74 years ≈ 10:00:00 + 134 years, 8 months, and 29 days\n\nTherefore, the time according to Earth's frame of reference when the spaceship passes the nearby star is approximately 10:00:00 on the 29th day of the 8th month, 134 years later."
