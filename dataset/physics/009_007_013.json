    "message_2": "To calculate the position of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and u = -30 cm (the negative sign indicates that the object is on the left side of the lens).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/20 = (30 - (-30))/(30 * v)\n\n1/20 = 60/(30 * v)\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n60 = 20 * 30 * v\n\nDivide both sides by 20 * 30:\n\nv = 60 / (20 * 30)\n\nv = 60 / 600\n\nv = 1/10\n\nSo, v = 60 cm (positive value indicates that the image is on the right side of the lens).\n\nNow, let's determine the nature of the image. Since the object is placed beyond the focal length of the lens, the image formed will be real, inverted, and magnified.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the convex lens is 60 cm away from the lens, on the right side, and it is real, inverted, and magnified."
