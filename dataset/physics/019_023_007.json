    "message_2": "In a 2-dimensional flat spacetime, the entanglement entropy of a free massless scalar field theory can be calculated using the well-known formula derived from the conformal field theory. When the full system is divided into two complementary regions, A and B, the entanglement entropy (S) is given by:\n\nS = (c/3) * ln(L/a)\n\nHere, c is the central charge of the conformal field theory, which is equal to 1 for a free massless scalar field in 2-dimensional spacetime. L is the length of the boundary between the two regions A and B, and a is a short-distance cutoff, which represents the lattice spacing or the minimum distance scale at which the field theory is defined.\n\nSo, for a free massless scalar field theory in 2-dimensional flat spacetime, the entanglement entropy when the full system is divided into two complementary regions is:\n\nS = (1/3) * ln(L/a)"
