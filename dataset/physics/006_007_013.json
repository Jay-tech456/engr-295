    "message_2": "The Franck-Hertz experiment, conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914, provides experimental evidence for the quantization of energy levels in atoms. This experiment was a crucial step in understanding the behavior of electrons in atoms and the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the Franck-Hertz experiment, a heated cathode emits electrons, which are then accelerated through a potential difference (voltage) towards a grid inside a glass tube filled with low-pressure mercury vapor. The electrons gain kinetic energy as they accelerate and then collide with mercury atoms in the vapor. If the energy of the colliding electron is sufficient, it can excite a mercury atom by transferring some of its energy to one of the atom's electrons, causing it to jump to a higher energy level (quantum state). After a short time, the excited electron in the mercury atom returns to its original lower energy state, releasing the absorbed energy in the form of a photon.\n\nThe key observation in the Franck-Hertz experiment is that the electron current reaching the grid (and subsequently a collector plate) depends on the accelerating voltage. At specific voltage values, the current drops significantly, indicating that the electrons have lost a significant amount of their kinetic energy due to inelastic collisions with mercury atoms. As the voltage is increased further, the current increases again until it reaches another specific voltage value where it drops again. This pattern repeats at regular intervals.\n\nThese regular intervals correspond to the discrete energy differences between the quantized energy levels in mercury atoms. The energy absorbed by the mercury atoms during the inelastic collisions is quantized, meaning it can only take specific values. This is a direct demonstration of the quantization of energy levels in atoms, as predicted by Niels Bohr's atomic model.\n\nIn summary, the Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates the quantization of energy levels in atoms by showing that electrons can only transfer discrete amounts of energy to mercury atoms during collisions. This results in a characteristic pattern of current drops at specific accelerating voltages, providing experimental evidence for the existence of quantized energy levels in atoms."
