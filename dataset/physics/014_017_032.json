    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy cosmic rays can transfer to an electronic device depends on the energy of the cosmic ray particles themselves. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. Their energies can range from millions of electron volts (MeV) to over 10^20 electron volts (eV) for the most energetic particles, known as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.\n\nWhen cosmic rays interact with electronic devices, they can cause single-event effects (SEEs), which can lead to temporary or permanent malfunctions. The amount of energy transferred to the device depends on the specific interaction, but it is generally on the order of a few MeV to a few hundred MeV for most cosmic rays.\n\nTo protect electronic devices from potential damage caused by cosmic rays, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Shielding: Adding shielding materials, such as aluminum or lead, around the device can help absorb some of the cosmic ray particles and reduce their impact. However, this may not be practical for all devices, especially those that need to be lightweight or portable.\n\n2. Redundancy: Designing the device with redundant components or systems can help ensure that if one part is affected by a cosmic ray, the device can still function correctly. This is commonly used in critical systems, such as those in aerospace applications.\n\n3. Error detection and correction: Implementing error detection and correction techniques in the device's hardware or software can help identify and correct any errors caused by cosmic rays. This can include techniques such as parity checks, checksums, and error-correcting codes.\n\n4. Hardening: Using radiation-hardened components and materials can help make the device more resistant to the effects of cosmic rays. These components are specifically designed to withstand the radiation environment in space or other high-radiation environments.\n\n5. Software mitigation: Implementing software algorithms that can detect and correct errors caused by cosmic rays can help minimize the impact on the device's performance and reliability.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of energy cosmic rays can transfer to an electronic device depends on the energy of the cosmic ray particles, which can range from a few MeV to over 10^20 eV. To protect electronic devices from potential damage, various strategies such as shielding, redundancy, error detection and correction, hardening, and software mitigation can be employed."
