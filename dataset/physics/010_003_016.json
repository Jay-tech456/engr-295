    "message_2": "To calculate the viscous force acting on the ball when it reaches its terminal velocity, we can use Stoke's Law. Stoke's Law states that the viscous force (F) acting on a spherical object moving through a fluid is given by:\n\nF = 6πηrv\n\nwhere:\nη = fluid viscosity (1 Pa.s)\nr = radius of the sphere (0.05 m)\nv = terminal velocity of the sphere\n\nHowever, we are given the initial velocity (10 m/s) and not the terminal velocity. To find the terminal velocity, we need to consider the forces acting on the sphere: gravitational force (Fg) and buoyancy force (Fb). At terminal velocity, the net force acting on the sphere is zero, so the viscous force (F) equals the sum of Fg and Fb.\n\nFg = mg\nFb = ρ_fVg\n\nwhere:\nm = mass of the sphere\ng = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nρ_f = density of the fluid\nV = volume of the sphere\n\nThe volume of the sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nAssuming the sphere is made of a material with a known density (ρ_s), we can calculate the mass (m) of the sphere:\n\nm = ρ_sV\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the viscous force (F) at terminal velocity:\n\nF = Fg + Fb\n6πηrv = mg + ρ_fVg\n\nWe don't have enough information to solve for the terminal velocity (v) directly, as we need the densities of the fluid (ρ_f) and the sphere (ρ_s). However, if we were given these values, we could solve for the terminal velocity and then calculate the viscous force acting on the ball when it reaches its terminal velocity using Stoke's Law."
