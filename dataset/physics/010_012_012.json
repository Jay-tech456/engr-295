The air properties are ρ = 1.184 kg/m³, μ=1.81×10⁻⁵ kg/ms, and the free stream velocity of the air is 80 mph. Calculate the thickness of the boundary layer at a location 0.75 meters from the leading edge of the plate.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer, we will use the Blasius solution for a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / V))^(1/2)\n\nwhere x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate (0.75 meters), V is the free stream velocity of the air, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the air.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the free stream velocity from mph to m/s:\n\n80 mph * (1609.34 m/mi) / (3600 s/hr) ≈ 35.76 m/s\n\nNext, we calculate the kinematic viscosity (ν) using the given air properties:\n\nν = μ / ρ = (1.81 × 10⁻⁵ kg/ms) / (1.184 kg/m³) ≈ 1.53 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ):\n\nδ = (5 * 0.75 * (1.53 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s) / (35.76 m/s))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ (5 * 0.75 * (4.29 × 10⁻⁷ m))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ (1.61 × 10⁻⁶ m)^(1/2)\nδ ≈ 0.00127 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at a location 0.75 meters from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.00127 meters or 1.27 mm."
