    "message_2": "The decay of a muon into an electron and two neutrinos is a weak interaction process, mediated by a W boson. The relevant Feynman diagram for this process is as follows:\n\n```\nμ (incoming) → μ (vertex 1) → W⁻ (vertex 2) → e⁻ (outgoing)\n                             → ν_μ (outgoing)\n                             → ν_e (outgoing)\n```\n\nHere, the muon (μ) decays into a W⁻ boson, which then decays into an electron (e⁻) and an electron antineutrino (ν_e). At the same time, a muon neutrino (ν_μ) is emitted.\n\nTo calculate the decay rate, we need to compute the matrix element squared, |M|^2, and integrate over the phase space of the final state particles. The matrix element M can be obtained using the Feynman rules for the weak interaction. In this case, the matrix element is given by:\n\nM = (g_w / √2) * (u_e * γ^μ * (1 - γ^5) * v_νe) * (g_w / √2) * (u_μ * γ_μ * (1 - γ^5) * v_νμ)\n\nHere, g_w is the weak coupling constant, γ^μ and γ^5 are the Dirac gamma matrices, and u and v are the spinors for the corresponding particles.\n\nTo compute |M|^2, we need to sum over the spins of the final state particles and average over the spins of the initial state particles. This calculation involves some algebraic manipulations using the properties of the gamma matrices and spinors. After simplification, we obtain:\n\n|M|^2 = (g_w^4 / 8) * (p_μ * p_e) * (p_μ * p_νe) * (p_νμ * p_e) * (p_νμ * p_νe)\n\nNow, we need to integrate |M|^2 over the phase space of the final state particles. The phase space factor is given by:\n\ndΦ = (1 / (2π)^5) * (1 / 16m_μ^2) * d^3p_e * d^3p_νe * d^3p_νμ * δ^4(p_μ - p_e - p_νe - p_νμ)\n\nHere, m_μ is the mass of the muon, and δ^4 is the four-dimensional Dirac delta function, which enforces energy-momentum conservation.\n\nThe decay rate Γ is obtained by integrating |M|^2 over the phase space:\n\nΓ = ∫ |M|^2 * dΦ\n\nThis integral is quite involved and requires some approximations and simplifications. After performing the integration, we obtain the decay rate for the muon decay:\n\nΓ ≈ G_F^2 * m_μ^5 / (192π^3)\n\nHere, G_F is the Fermi constant, which is related to the weak coupling constant g_w by G_F = g_w^2 / (8 * M_W^2), where M_W is the mass of the W boson.\n\nThe mean lifetime τ of the muon is the inverse of the decay rate:\n\nτ ≈ 1 / Γ\n\nUsing the known values of G_F, m_μ, and the experimental value of the muon lifetime, we can verify that this calculation is consistent with the observed muon decay properties."
