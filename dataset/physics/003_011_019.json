    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and x is the distance from the center of the disc along its axis.\n\nGiven values:\nR = 0.1 m\nI = 5 A\nx = 0.2 m\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.2 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-6) Tm² * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.04 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-8) Tm²) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-8) Tm²) / (2 * 0.125 m³)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-8) Tm²) / (0.25 m³)\n\nB ≈ 2.51 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point on the axis of the disc that is 0.2 m away from the center of the disc is approximately 2.51 × 10^(-7) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (counterclockwise when looking at the disc from above), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be pointing upward along the axis of the disc."
