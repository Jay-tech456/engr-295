    "message_1": "What is the change in entropy when a liquid water at 50 °C at atmospheric pressure is heated to steam at 100 °C at the same pressure (assuming no heat loss occurs and the process is reversible)? The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/(g·K) and the molar heat of vaporization of water is 40.7 kJ/mol.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy, we need to consider two processes: heating the liquid water from 50 °C to 100 °C, and then vaporizing the water at 100 °C. We will assume 1 mole of water for simplicity.\n\n1. Heating the liquid water from 50 °C to 100 °C:\n\nΔS1 = ∫(Cp/T)dT (from 50 °C to 100 °C)\n\nHere, Cp is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/(g·K)), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. We need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin: T1 = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K, and T2 = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 K.\n\nSince Cp is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nΔS1 = Cp * ∫(1/T)dT (from 323.15 K to 373.15 K)\n\nΔS1 = Cp * (ln(T2) - ln(T1))\n\nΔS1 = 4.18 J/(g·K) * (ln(373.15) - ln(323.15))\n\nΔS1 ≈ 4.18 J/(g·K) * 0.139\n\nΔS1 ≈ 0.581 J/(g·K)\n\nSince we assumed 1 mole of water, we need to multiply by the molar mass of water (18.015 g/mol) to get the entropy change in J/mol·K:\n\nΔS1 = 0.581 J/(g·K) * 18.015 g/mol ≈ 10.46 J/(mol·K)\n\n2. Vaporizing the water at 100 °C:\n\nΔS2 = ΔHvap/T\n\nHere, ΔHvap is the molar heat of vaporization of water (40.7 kJ/mol), and T is the temperature in Kelvin (373.15 K).\n\nΔS2 = (40.7 * 10^3 J/mol) / 373.15 K ≈ 109.0 J/(mol·K)\n\nNow, we can find the total change in entropy by adding the entropy changes from both processes:\n\nΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = 10.46 J/(mol·K) + 109.0 J/(mol·K) ≈ 119.46 J/(mol·K)\n\nSo, the change in entropy when liquid water at 50 °C is heated to steam at 100 °C at atmospheric pressure is approximately 119.46 J/(mol·K)."
