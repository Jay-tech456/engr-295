    "message_2": "To calculate the final energy of the cosmic ray particle after passing through the lead block, we need to know the initial energy of the particle, the thickness of the lead block, and the percentage of energy loss due to interactions with the atoms in the block.\n\nLet's denote the initial energy of the cosmic ray particle as E_initial, the thickness of the lead block as d, and the percentage of energy loss as P.\n\nThe energy loss can be expressed as a fraction, so P/100. The energy loss due to interaction with the atoms in the block can be calculated as:\n\nEnergy_loss = E_initial * (P/100)\n\nNow, we can find the final energy of the cosmic ray particle after passing through the lead block:\n\nE_final = E_initial - Energy_loss\n\nIf you provide the values for E_initial, d, and P, I can help you calculate the final energy of the cosmic ray particle."
