    "message_2": "The relativistic Doppler shift can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (λ_observed - λ_emitted) / λ_emitted = (sqrt(1 + β) / sqrt(1 - β)) - 1\n\nwhere Δλ/λ is the fractional change in wavelength, λ_observed is the observed wavelength, λ_emitted is the emitted wavelength, and β is the ratio of the object's velocity (v) to the speed of light (c), i.e., β = v/c.\n\nIn this case, the object is moving towards the observer at 0.6c, so β = 0.6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Doppler shift:\n\nΔλ/λ = (sqrt(1 + 0.6) / sqrt(1 - 0.6)) - 1\nΔλ/λ = (sqrt(1.6) / sqrt(0.4)) - 1\nΔλ/λ ≈ 1.6667 - 1\nΔλ/λ ≈ 0.6667\n\nThe fractional change in wavelength is approximately 0.6667, which means the observed wavelength is shorter (blue-shifted) compared to the emitted wavelength when the object is at rest.\n\nTo find the observed wavelength (λ_observed), we can use the following equation:\n\nλ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + Δλ/λ)\n\nLet λ_emitted be the wavelength of light emitted by the object when it is at rest. Then,\n\nλ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + 0.6667)\nλ_observed ≈ 1.6667 * λ_emitted\n\nThe observed wavelength of light emitted by the object moving at 0.6c towards the observer is approximately 1.6667 times shorter than the wavelength of light emitted by the same object when it is at rest."
