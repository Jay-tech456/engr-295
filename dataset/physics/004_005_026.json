    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of a black hole's event horizon, which is the point beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere:\n- r_s is the Schwarzschild radius\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the black hole in kilograms. The mass of the sun (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Since the black hole has a mass equal to three times that of the sun, its mass (M) is:\n\nM = 3 * M_sun = 3 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 5.967 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula to find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 × 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ (2 * 6.674 × 10^-11 * 5.967 × 10^30) / (8.987 × 10^16)\nr_s ≈ 1.191 × 10^20 / 8.987 × 10^16\nr_s ≈ 13.26 × 10^3 m\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass equal to three times that of the sun is approximately 13,260 meters or 13.26 kilometers."
