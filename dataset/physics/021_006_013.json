    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole affects the orbits of nearby stars and planets through its strong gravitational pull. Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This strong gravitational force can have significant effects on the motion of nearby celestial objects.\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: The primary effect of a black hole on nearby stars and planets is the gravitational attraction it exerts on them. This force can cause the orbits of these objects to change, making them move in elliptical or even highly eccentric orbits around the black hole. The closer the object is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational force and the more significant the effect on its orbit.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The strong gravitational field of a black hole can bend the path of light coming from distant stars and galaxies. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, can cause the images of these objects to appear distorted or even multiply. Observing these lensing effects can provide indirect evidence for the presence of a black hole.\n\n3. Accretion disk and jets: When a black hole is part of a binary system, it can pull matter from its companion star. This matter forms an accretion disk around the black hole, which can emit intense radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays, as the material spirals inward and gets heated up. Additionally, some of the infalling matter can be ejected in the form of high-speed jets perpendicular to the accretion disk. Observing these phenomena can provide strong evidence for the presence of a black hole.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: When two black holes or other massive objects merge, they can produce ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves. These waves can be detected by specialized observatories like LIGO and Virgo, providing direct evidence for the existence of black holes.\n\nTo confirm the existence of a black hole, astronomers typically look for a combination of these observable effects. For example, they might observe the motion of stars near the center of a galaxy to determine if their orbits are influenced by a massive, unseen object. They might also look for X-ray emissions from an accretion disk or the telltale signs of gravitational lensing. By combining multiple lines of evidence, astronomers can build a strong case for the presence of a black hole."
