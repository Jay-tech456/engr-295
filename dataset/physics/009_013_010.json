    "message_2": "Spherical aberration is an optical effect that occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point. This can lead to a loss of image quality, particularly in high-resolution microscopy. The maximum acceptable spherical aberration depends on the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens, which is a measure of its light-gathering ability and resolution.\n\nTo determine the maximum acceptable spherical aberration, we can use the Rayleigh criterion. The Rayleigh criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable when the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of one point source coincides with the first minimum of the other point source. This criterion is given by the following formula:\n\nΔr = 0.61 * λ / NA\n\nwhere Δr is the radius of the Airy disk (the central bright spot in the diffraction pattern), λ is the wavelength of the light used, and NA is the numerical aperture of the objective lens.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum acceptable spherical aberration (ΔS) to be the one that causes a deviation in the wavefront equal to 1/4 of the wavelength (λ/4). This is a commonly used criterion in optics to ensure acceptable image quality.\n\nWe can relate the maximum acceptable spherical aberration (ΔS) to the radius of the Airy disk (Δr) using the following formula:\n\nΔS = (2 * π * Δr^2) / λ\n\nSubstituting the Rayleigh criterion formula for Δr, we get:\n\nΔS = (2 * π * (0.61 * λ / NA)^2) / λ\n\nNow, let's assume that we are using a green light with a wavelength of 550 nm (5.5 x 10^-7 m) for our microscope. Plugging in the values for λ and NA, we can calculate the maximum acceptable spherical aberration:\n\nΔS = (2 * π * (0.61 * 5.5 x 10^-7 m / 1.25)^2) / (5.5 x 10^-7 m)\nΔS ≈ 1.29 x 10^-6 m\n\nSo, the maximum acceptable spherical aberration for a microscope objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.25 is approximately 1.29 x 10^-6 m (1.29 μm)."
