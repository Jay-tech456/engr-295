    "message_2": "To calculate the specific internal energy of the mixture, we need to find the internal energy of each component (water and ethanol) and then find the weighted average based on their masses.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy (U) is a function of temperature only and can be calculated using the equation:\n\nU = n * Cv * T\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles for each component:\n\nn_water = mass_water / molar_mass_water\nn_water = 2 kg / (18 g/mol * 1 kg/1000 g) = 111.11 mol\n\nn_ethanol = mass_ethanol / molar_mass_ethanol\nn_ethanol = 3 kg / (46 g/mol * 1 kg/1000 g) = 65.22 mol\n\nNow, we need to find the molar heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) for each component. For water and ethanol, we can use the following values:\n\nCv_water = 75 J/(mol*K)\nCv_ethanol = 84 J/(mol*K)\n\nNow, we can calculate the internal energy of each component:\n\nU_water = n_water * Cv_water * T\nU_water = 111.11 mol * 75 J/(mol*K) * 300 K = 2,498,250 J\n\nU_ethanol = n_ethanol * Cv_ethanol * T\nU_ethanol = 65.22 mol * 84 J/(mol*K) * 300 K = 1,643,976 J\n\nNow, we can find the total internal energy of the mixture:\n\nU_total = U_water + U_ethanol\nU_total = 2,498,250 J + 1,643,976 J = 4,142,226 J\n\nFinally, we can find the specific internal energy of the mixture by dividing the total internal energy by the total mass:\n\nspecific_internal_energy = U_total / (mass_water + mass_ethanol)\nspecific_internal_energy = 4,142,226 J / (2 kg + 3 kg) = 828,445.2 J/kg\n\nSo, the specific internal energy of the mixture is approximately 828,445.2 J/kg."
