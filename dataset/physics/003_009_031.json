    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the problem involves a sphere carrying a current, we need to make some assumptions to simplify the problem. \n\nAssumption: The current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere.\n\nNow, let's consider an infinitesimally small area dA on the surface of the sphere. The current flowing through this area is given by:\n\ndI = I * (dA / A)\n\nwhere I is the total current (2 A) and A is the surface area of the sphere (4 * pi * r^2).\n\nNow, let's consider a point P at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the sphere. The magnetic field dB at point P due to the current dI is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dA * sinθ) / R^2\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), dA is the infinitesimal area, θ is the angle between the current element and the line connecting the center of the sphere to point P, and R is the distance between the current element and point P (8 cm).\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\nB = ∫∫ dB\n\nSince the problem has spherical symmetry, we can simplify the integration by considering only the radial component of the magnetic field:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫ (dI * dA * sinθ) / R^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for dI and perform the integration over the surface of the sphere:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / A) * ∫∫ (dA * sinθ) / R^2\n\nThe integral ∫∫ (dA * sinθ) / R^2 can be evaluated using spherical coordinates:\n\n∫∫ (dA * sinθ) / R^2 = ∫(0 to 2π) ∫(0 to π) (r^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) / R^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere (5 cm).\n\nSince R is constant (8 cm), we can take it out of the integral:\n\n∫∫ (dA * sinθ) / R^2 = (r^2 / R^2) * ∫(0 to 2π) ∫(0 to π) (sinθ * dθ * dφ)\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\n∫(0 to 2π) ∫(0 to π) (sinθ * dθ * dφ) = 4π\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the expression for B_radial:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I / A) * (r^2 / R^2) * 4π\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ * I * r^2) / (A * R^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, r, A, and R:\n\nB_radial = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 2 A * (5 cm)^2) / (4 * π * (5 cm)^2 * (8 cm)^2)\n\nB_radial ≈ 6.25 × 10^-7 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 6.25 × 10^-7 T."
