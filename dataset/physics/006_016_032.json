    "message_1": "A physics student wants to calculate the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) effect in a Sodium (Na) atom. The atomic number of Sodium is 11 and its nucleus contains 12 neutrons and 11 protons. The student has the value of the gyromagnetic ratio for sodium as 1.040628 × 10^8 T^-1 s^-1. Determine the NMR effect for Sodium atom if it is placed in a magnetic field of 5 T.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the NMR effect for a Sodium atom, we need to determine the Larmor frequency (also known as the precession frequency) of the nucleus in the magnetic field. The Larmor frequency (ω) is given by the following equation:\n\nω = γ * B\n\nwhere ω is the Larmor frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) for Sodium as 1.040628 × 10^8 T^-1 s^-1 and the magnetic field strength (B) as 5 T, we can calculate the Larmor frequency:\n\nω = (1.040628 × 10^8 T^-1 s^-1) * (5 T)\n\nω = 5.20314 × 10^8 s^-1\n\nThe NMR effect for the Sodium atom in a 5 T magnetic field is characterized by a Larmor frequency of 5.20314 × 10^8 s^-1."
