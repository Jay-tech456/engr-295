    "message_2": "The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol: 40.7 kJ/mol * 1000 J/kJ = 40700 J/mol.\n\nWe are also given the temperature (T2) as 25°C, which we need to convert to Kelvin: 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K.\n\nWe need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (P2). To do this, we need the vapor pressure of water at a known temperature (P1) and the corresponding temperature (T1). We can use the known vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K), which is 101325 Pa (1 atm).\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -40700 J/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp(-40700 / (8.314) * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3166.5 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C when the enthalpy of vaporization is 40.7 kJ/mol is approximately 3166.5 Pa."
