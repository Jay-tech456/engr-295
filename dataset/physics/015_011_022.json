    "message_2": "The exact number of gravitational wave detections by future observatories like the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope is difficult to predict. However, it is estimated that these advanced detectors could potentially detect thousands of gravitational wave events per year.\n\nThese detections will significantly contribute to our understanding of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena in several ways:\n\n1. Probing the population of compact objects: The increased sensitivity of these detectors will allow us to detect a larger number of binary systems involving black holes and neutron stars. This will help us understand the formation and evolution of these compact objects and their populations in the universe.\n\n2. Testing general relativity: Gravitational wave detections provide a unique way to test Einstein's theory of general relativity in the strong-field regime. The advanced detectors will allow us to perform more precise tests and potentially reveal deviations from the theory, which could lead to new insights into the nature of gravity.\n\n3. Cosmology: Gravitational wave detections can be used to measure the expansion rate of the universe (the Hubble constant) independently of other methods, such as observations of supernovae or the cosmic microwave background. This will help us better understand the history and evolution of the universe.\n\n4. Multimessenger astronomy: The advanced detectors will increase the chances of detecting gravitational waves from events that also produce electromagnetic radiation, such as neutron star mergers. Combining gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations will provide a more complete picture of these events and help us understand the underlying physics.\n\n5. Probing the early universe: Gravitational waves generated in the early universe, such as those produced by cosmic inflation or phase transitions, could potentially be detected by these advanced observatories. This would provide a unique window into the very early universe and help us understand its evolution.\n\nIn summary, the increased sensitivity of future gravitational wave observatories like the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will lead to a significant increase in the number of detections, which will greatly enhance our understanding of various astrophysical and cosmological phenomena."
