    "message_1": "A physics student needs to calculate the critical temperature of a substance having a specific heat capacity of 10 J/mol*K and a molar enthalpy of vaporization of 40 kJ/mol. If the molar mass of the substance is 50 g/mol and the critical pressure is 5 atm, what is the critical temperature of the substance?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical temperature of the substance, we can use the Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature for a phase transition:\n\ndP/dT = (ΔHvap) / (T * ΔV)\n\nwhere dP/dT is the change in pressure with respect to temperature, ΔHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization, T is the temperature, and ΔV is the change in molar volume during the phase transition.\n\nAt the critical point, the substance is at the boundary between the liquid and gas phases, so we can assume that the change in molar volume is approximately equal to the molar volume of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law to estimate the molar volume at the critical point:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. At the critical point, we have:\n\nV = nRT / P\n\nSince we are interested in the molar volume, we can set n = 1 and use the critical pressure:\n\nV = RTc / Pc\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature and Pc is the critical pressure. We can now substitute this expression for ΔV in the Clapeyron equation:\n\ndP/dT = (ΔHvap) / (T * (RTc / Pc))\n\nAt the critical point, dP/dT = 0, so we can solve for Tc:\n\n0 = (ΔHvap) / (Tc * (RTc / Pc))\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nTc^2 = (ΔHvap * Pc) / R\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n\nΔHvap = 40 kJ/mol = 40,000 J/mol\nPc = 5 atm = 5 * 101325 Pa = 506625 Pa\nR = 8.314 J/mol*K\n\nTc^2 = (40,000 J/mol * 506625 Pa) / 8.314 J/mol*K\nTc^2 ≈ 2.44 * 10^9 K^2\nTc ≈ 493 K\n\nSo the critical temperature of the substance is approximately 493 K."
