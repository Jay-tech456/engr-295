    "message_2": "The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that was initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Later, it was realized that axions could also be a viable candidate for dark matter. The mass of an axion is inversely proportional to the energy scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking, which is a theoretical concept introduced to solve the strong CP problem. The relationship between the axion mass (m_a) and the energy scale (f_a) can be expressed as:\n\nm_a ‚àù 1/f_a\n\nIn the context of dark matter, the axion's mass plays a crucial role in determining its potential to make up a significant portion of dark matter. Axions with lower masses are more likely to contribute to the dark matter density in the universe. The reason is that lighter axions have a larger de Broglie wavelength, which allows them to form a Bose-Einstein condensate and act as cold dark matter. Cold dark matter is the leading candidate for the observed dark matter, as it can explain the large-scale structure formation in the universe.\n\nThe mass range for axions that could potentially make up dark matter is estimated to be between 10^(-6) eV and 10^(-3) eV. This range is based on astrophysical and cosmological constraints, such as the observed dark matter density and the requirement that axions do not overclose the universe or disrupt the successful predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn comparison to other dark matter candidates, axions have some unique features. The most popular alternative dark matter candidate is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). WIMPs are expected to have masses in the range of 10 GeV to a few TeV and interact via the weak nuclear force. While WIMPs have been extensively searched for in direct detection experiments, no conclusive evidence has been found yet.\n\nAxions, on the other hand, interact very weakly with ordinary matter and have a much smaller mass, making them more challenging to detect. However, their potential to form a Bose-Einstein condensate and act as cold dark matter gives them a distinct advantage in explaining the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the mass of an axion is inversely proportional to the energy scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking, and lighter axions are more likely to contribute to the dark matter density in the universe. Axions are a viable dark matter candidate with unique features compared to other candidates like WIMPs, but their detection remains a significant challenge for experimental physicists."
