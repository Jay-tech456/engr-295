    "message_2": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It is designed to accelerate protons to extremely high speeds, close to the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum energy achieved by the LHC is 6.5 TeV (tera-electron volts) per proton. To find the maximum velocity of a proton in the LHC, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (m*c^2)^2 + (p*c)^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the proton, m is its rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is its momentum. Rearranging the equation to solve for momentum, we get:\n\np = sqrt[(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2) / c^2]\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg, and the speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\np = sqrt[((6.5 TeV)^2 - (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)^2) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2]\n\nConverting 6.5 TeV to joules (1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J), we get:\n\np = sqrt[((6.5 x 10^12 eV * 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV)^2 - (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)^2) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2]\n\nAfter calculating the momentum, we can find the velocity using the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = m*v / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for velocity, we get:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 * c^2) / (p^2 + m^2 * c^2))\n\nPlugging in the values for the mass, momentum, and speed of light, we can calculate the maximum velocity of a proton in the LHC. The result will be very close to the speed of light, but not exactly equal to it, as particles with mass cannot reach the speed of light according to the theory of relativity.\n\nThe maximum velocity of a proton in the LHC is approximately 0.999999989 c, where c is the speed of light. This means that the proton is traveling at about 99.9999989% of the speed of light."
