    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram for the formation of the image, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a concave mirror with its principal axis (horizontal line).\n2. Mark the focal point (F) at a distance of 30 cm from the mirror (pole P) along the principal axis.\n3. Place the object (O) at a distance of 45 cm from the mirror along the principal axis.\n4. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object (O) towards the mirror. After reflecting, this ray will pass through the focal point (F).\n5. Draw another ray from the top of the object (O) that passes through the focal point (F) and reflects off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.\n6. The point where the two reflected rays intersect is the position of the image (I).\n\nNow, to calculate the position and magnification of the image, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nGiven:\nf = 30 cm\nu = -45 cm (object distance is negative for a real object)\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (v) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/30 = 1/(-45) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/30 + 1/45\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 90\n1/v = 5/90\nv = 90/5\nv = 18 cm\n\nThe image is formed at a distance of 18 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object (real image).\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -18 / (-45)\nM = 18/45\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification of the image is 2/5 or 0.4, which means the image is smaller than the object.\n\nIn summary, the image is formed 18 cm away from the mirror on the same side as the object, and it is smaller than the object with a magnification of 0.4."
