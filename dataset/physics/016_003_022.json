    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) for high-temperature superconductors is the temperature below which a material exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism. High-temperature superconductors are a class of materials that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures significantly higher than conventional superconductors, which typically have Tc below 30 K (-243.15 °C). For high-temperature superconductors, the critical temperature can range from around 30 K to over 130 K (-143.15 °C).\n\nWhen the temperature of a high-temperature superconductor is reduced below its critical temperature, its electrical resistance drops to zero. This means that an electrical current can flow through the material without any energy loss, making it highly efficient for applications such as power transmission and energy storage.\n\nIn addition to zero electrical resistance, high-temperature superconductors also exhibit perfect diamagnetism below their critical temperature. This means that they expel all magnetic fields from their interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This property allows for applications such as magnetic levitation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature for high-temperature superconductors is the temperature below which they exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism. These properties make them highly desirable for various applications in energy, transportation, and medical fields."
