    "message_1": "What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance r from the center of a coaxial cable carrying a current I? The inner and outer radii of the cable are a and b respectively, and the current is uniformly distributed throughout the cable.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P located at a distance r from the center of the coaxial cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I_enclosed).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe will consider two cases: when point P is inside the cable (r < a) and when point P is outside the cable (a < r < b).\n\nCase 1: r < a (point P is inside the cable)\n\nIn this case, we can consider a circular Amperian loop of radius r centered at the center of the cable. The current enclosed by this loop is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop, so:\n\nI_enclosed = I * (πr² / πa²) = I * (r² / a²)\n\nNow, the magnetic field B is tangential to the Amperian loop, and its magnitude is constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral of B around the loop is:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nApplying Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I * (r² / a²)\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀I * r) / (2πa²)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule, which means it is in the azimuthal direction (tangential to the circular loop).\n\nCase 2: a < r < b (point P is outside the cable)\n\nIn this case, the Amperian loop of radius r encloses the entire current I. Therefore, I_enclosed = I. The line integral of B around the loop is still:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B * 2πr\n\nApplying Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is still in the azimuthal direction (tangential to the circular loop).\n\nIn summary:\n\n- If r < a, the magnitude of the magnetic field is B = (μ₀I * r) / (2πa²), and the direction is azimuthal.\n- If a < r < b, the magnitude of the magnetic field is B = (μ₀I) / (2πr), and the direction is azimuthal."
