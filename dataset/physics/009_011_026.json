    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's Equation relates the focal length (f), the refractive index of the lens material (n), and the radii of curvature of the two surfaces (R1 and R2):\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nIn this problem, we are given the focal length (f = -20 cm, negative since it's a diverging lens), the refractive index (n = 1.5), and the radius of curvature of the curved surface (R1 = 30 cm). We need to find the radius of curvature of the plane surface (R2).\n\nSince the surface is plane, it can be considered as having an infinite radius of curvature. Therefore, R2 = ∞.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Lensmaker's Equation:\n\n1/(-20) = (1.5 - 1) * (1/30 - 1/∞)\n\n-1/20 = 0.5 * (1/30)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20:\n\n-1 = 0.5 * (20/30)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n-2 = 20/30\n\nTo find the fraction, multiply both sides by 30:\n\n-60 = 20\n\nThis result is not possible, as the radius of curvature cannot be negative. The issue here is that we assumed the plane surface has an infinite radius of curvature. However, in reality, the plane surface can be considered as having a very large radius of curvature compared to the curved surface. In this case, the Lensmaker's Equation may not be the most suitable method to find the radius of curvature of the plane surface.\n\nIn conclusion, the Lensmaker's Equation cannot be used to accurately determine the radius of curvature of the plane surface in this scenario."
