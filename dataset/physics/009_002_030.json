    "message_1": "A physics student has a rectangular glass prism of refractive index 1.5. The length of the prism is 10 cm and the width is 6 cm. A ray of light is incident on one of the faces of the prism at an angle of 60 degrees to the normal. What is the angle of deviation of the ray as it emerges from the other side of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of deviation of the ray as it emerges from the other side of the prism, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the angle of refraction (r1) when the light enters the prism using Snell's Law.\n2. Calculate the angle of incidence (i2) inside the prism using the geometry of the rectangular prism.\n3. Calculate the angle of refraction (r2) when the light exits the prism using Snell's Law.\n4. Calculate the angle of deviation (D) using the initial angle of incidence and the final angle of refraction.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the angle of refraction (r1) when the light enters the prism using Snell's Law.\n\nSnell's Law: n1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(r1)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1), i1 is the angle of incidence (60 degrees), and n2 is the refractive index of the glass prism (1.5).\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(r1)\nsin(r1) = sin(60) / 1.5\nr1 = arcsin(sin(60) / 1.5) ≈ 24.1 degrees\n\nStep 2: Calculate the angle of incidence (i2) inside the prism using the geometry of the rectangular prism.\n\nSince the prism is rectangular, the angle between the two faces is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle of incidence inside the prism (i2) can be calculated as:\n\ni2 = 90 - r1 ≈ 90 - 24.1 ≈ 65.9 degrees\n\nStep 3: Calculate the angle of refraction (r2) when the light exits the prism using Snell's Law.\n\nSnell's Law: n1 * sin(i2) = n2 * sin(r2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the glass prism (1.5), i2 is the angle of incidence inside the prism (65.9 degrees), and n2 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1).\n\n1.5 * sin(65.9) = 1 * sin(r2)\nsin(r2) = 1.5 * sin(65.9)\nr2 = arcsin(1.5 * sin(65.9)) ≈ 80.5 degrees\n\nStep 4: Calculate the angle of deviation (D) using the initial angle of incidence and the final angle of refraction.\n\nThe angle of deviation (D) is the difference between the initial angle of incidence (i1) and the final angle of refraction (r2), taking into account that the light has been deviated twice (once when entering the prism and once when exiting).\n\nD = (i1 - r1) + (r2 - i2)\nD = (60 - 24.1) + (80.5 - 65.9)\nD ≈ 35.9 + 14.6 ≈ 50.5 degrees\n\nThe angle of deviation of the ray as it emerges from the other side of the prism is approximately 50.5 degrees."
