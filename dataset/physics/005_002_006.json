    "message_2": "When an object is moving at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light), its length contracts in the direction of motion as observed by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is known as length contraction or Lorentz contraction. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L' is the contracted length as measured by the moving observer, L is the proper length as measured by the stationary observer (in this case, the length of the spaceship as measured on Earth), v is the relative velocity of the moving object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, L = 200 meters, v = 0.8c, and c is the speed of light. We want to find L', the length of the spaceship as measured by someone on the spaceship.\n\nL' = 200 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nL' = 200 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL' = 200 * sqrt(0.36)\nL' = 200 * 0.6\nL' = 120 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by someone on the spaceship is 120 meters."
