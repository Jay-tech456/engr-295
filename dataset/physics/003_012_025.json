    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying plane, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the plane is infinitely long in one dimension, we need to use the formula for the magnetic field produced by an infinite current-carrying sheet:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the plane.\n\nHowever, the plane has a finite width (0.15 m), so we need to consider the magnetic field produced by two infinite current-carrying sheets separated by the width of the plane. The magnetic field at a point between the two sheets will be the difference between the magnetic fields produced by each sheet.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field produced by each sheet:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m) = 10 × 10⁻⁷ T = 1 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nB₂ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * (0.1 m + 0.15 m)) = 10 × 10⁻⁷ T / 1.5 = 0.67 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the magnetic fields produced by each sheet:\n\nB = B₁ - B₂ = 1 × 10⁻⁶ T - 0.67 × 10⁻⁶ T = 0.33 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced by the current-carrying plane of width 0.15 m and a current of 5 A flowing through it, located at a distance of 0.1 m from the plane and perpendicular to it, is approximately 0.33 μT."
