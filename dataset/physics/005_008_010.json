    "message_1": "A spaceship moves towards Earth with a velocity of 0.8c. At t=0 according to the spaceship's clock, a signal is sent towards Earth that reaches Earth at t=1hour. What is the time elapsed on Earth from the moment the spaceship passed by Earth until it receives the response signal sent from Earth? Use Lorentz transformation equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lorentz transformation equations. The Lorentz factor (γ) is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and Earth, and c is the speed of light. In this case, v = 0.8c, so:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.64) = 1 / √(0.36) = 5/3\n\nNow, we know that the signal reaches Earth at t = 1 hour according to Earth's clock. We can use the time dilation equation to find the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock when the signal is sent:\n\nt' = t / γ\n\nwhere t' is the time elapsed on the spaceship's clock and t is the time elapsed on Earth's clock. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nt' = 1 hour / (5/3) = 3/5 hour\n\nNow, let's consider the return signal. The spaceship is still moving towards Earth, so the return signal will take less time to reach the spaceship. We can use the same time dilation equation to find the time elapsed on Earth's clock when the return signal is received:\n\nt = γ * t'\n\nt = (5/3) * (3/5 hour) = 1 hour\n\nSo, the total time elapsed on Earth's clock from the moment the spaceship passed by Earth until it receives the response signal sent from Earth is 1 hour (for the signal to reach Earth) + 1 hour (for the return signal to reach the spaceship) = 2 hours."
