    "message_2": "To find the change in length of the crystal, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L₀ is the initial length, α is the thermal expansion coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nL₀ = 2 cm\nα = 4.3 x 10^-6 per ℃\nΔT = 80℃ - 20℃ = 60℃\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔL = 2 cm * (4.3 x 10^-6 per ℃) * 60℃\n\nΔL = 2 cm * (4.3 x 10^-6) * 60\n\nΔL ≈ 0.000516 cm\n\nSo, the change in length of the crystal when it is heated from 20℃ to 80℃ is approximately 0.000516 cm."
