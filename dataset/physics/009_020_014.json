    "message_2": "To find the angle at which the two wavelengths will be in phase in the first order diffraction pattern, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the lines on the grating, θ is the angle of diffraction, m is the order of the diffraction pattern, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). Since there are 7000 lines per centimeter, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 cm / 7000 lines = 1/7000 cm = 1/70000 m\n\nNow, we can set up the grating equation for each wavelength and solve for the angle θ:\n\nFor λ1 = 550 nm:\n\nd * sin(θ1) = m * λ1\n1/70000 * sin(θ1) = 1 * (550 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nFor λ2 = 600 nm:\n\nd * sin(θ2) = m * λ2\n1/70000 * sin(θ2) = 1 * (600 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nSince we want to find the angle at which the two wavelengths are in phase, we can set sin(θ1) = sin(θ2):\n\n(550 * 10^(-9) m) / (1/70000 m) = (600 * 10^(-9) m) / (1/70000 m)\n\nSolving for θ1:\n\nθ1 = arcsin((550 * 10^(-9) m) / (1/70000 m))\nθ1 ≈ 4.47°\n\nSince sin(θ1) = sin(θ2), the angle at which the two wavelengths will be in phase in the first order diffraction pattern is approximately 4.47°."
