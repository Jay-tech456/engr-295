    "message_2": "To calculate the first-order diffraction angle, we can use the grating equation:\n\nn * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of diffraction (in this case, n = 1 for first-order diffraction), λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the distance between the grooves (grating spacing), and θ is the diffraction angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the grating spacing (d). We are given the groove density, which is 1200 lines/mm. To find the grating spacing, we can take the reciprocal of the groove density:\n\nd = 1 / (groove density) = 1 / 1200 lines/mm = 1 / 1200 mm/line\n\nNow, we need to convert the units to meters:\n\nd = 1 / 1200 * (1 m / 1000 mm) = 1 / 1,200,000 m/line ≈ 8.33 * 10^(-7) m\n\nNow we can use the grating equation to find the first-order diffraction angle:\n\n1 * λ = d * sin(θ)\n\nWe are given the wavelength λ = 600 nm. We need to convert this to meters:\n\nλ = 600 nm * (1 m / 1,000,000,000 nm) = 6 * 10^(-7) m\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the grating equation:\n\n1 * (6 * 10^(-7) m) = (8.33 * 10^(-7) m) * sin(θ)\n\nSolving for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (6 * 10^(-7) m) / (8.33 * 10^(-7) m) ≈ 0.72\n\nNow we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.72:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.72) ≈ 46.4°\n\nSo, the first-order diffraction angle for the given grating and wavelength is approximately 46.4°."
