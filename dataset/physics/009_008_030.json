    "message_1": "A student is asked to draw a ray diagram for an object placed 10 cm away from a converging lens of focal length 20 cm. What will be the position and size of the image formed?",
    "message_2": "To find the position and size of the image formed, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, the object distance (u) = -10 cm (negative because the object is on the left side of the lens) and the focal length (f) = 20 cm.\n\nPlugging the values into the lens formula:\n1/20 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/10\n1/v = (1+2)/20\n1/v = 3/20\nv = 20/3 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 20/3 cm (approximately 6.67 cm) to the right of the lens.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nMagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nPlugging the values, we get:\nm = -(20/3)/(-10)\nm = (20/3) / 10\nm = 2/3\n\nThe magnification is 2/3, which means the image is 2/3 the size of the object. If the object's height is given, you can multiply it by 2/3 to find the height of the image. The image is also inverted since the magnification is positive.\n\nIn summary, the image is formed at a distance of approximately 6.67 cm to the right of the lens, and its size is 2/3 the size of the object, and it is inverted."
