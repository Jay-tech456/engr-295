    "message_2": "Once matter passes the event horizon of a black hole, it is essentially lost to the outside universe and is destined to be compressed and pulled towards the central singularity. The event horizon is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In simpler terms, it is the point of no return.\n\nThe physical phenomena occurring at the event horizon that make it impossible for matter to escape are primarily due to the immense gravitational pull of the black hole. The gravitational force is so strong that it warps spacetime around it, causing the escape velocity to exceed the speed of light. Since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, it is impossible for matter or even light itself to escape the black hole once it has crossed the event horizon.\n\nAdditionally, as matter approaches the event horizon, it experiences a process called \"spaghettification\" or the \"noodle effect.\" This is due to the extreme tidal forces acting on the matter, stretching it into long, thin shapes as it is pulled towards the singularity. This further contributes to the destruction and absorption of matter by the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the fate of matter once it passes the event horizon of a black hole is that it becomes irretrievably trapped, ultimately being compressed and pulled towards the central singularity. The physical phenomena responsible for this are the immense gravitational pull of the black hole and the warping of spacetime, which make it impossible for matter to escape."
