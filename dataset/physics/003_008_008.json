    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nHowever, due to the rectangular shape of the metal sheet, it is more convenient to use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight wire carrying current I at a perpendicular distance d from the wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2π * d)\n\nWe can divide the rectangular sheet into infinitesimally small current-carrying wires parallel to the width (0.5 m) and integrate the magnetic field contribution from each wire.\n\nLet's consider a small current element at a distance x from the center of the sheet along its length (1 m). The current in this small element is given by:\n\ndI = (I * dx) / L\n\nwhere L is the length of the sheet (1 m) and dx is the infinitesimal length along the sheet.\n\nThe perpendicular distance from this current element to point P is:\n\nd = sqrt((1 m)² + x²)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field dB due to this small current element at point P:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI) / (2π * d)\n\nSubstituting the expression for dI:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dx) / (2π * L * d)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire length of the sheet from x = -L/2 to x = L/2:\n\nB = ∫[(-L/2) to (L/2)] (μ₀ * I * dx) / (2π * L * sqrt((1 m)² + x²))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = ∫[-0.5 to 0.5] (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A * dx) / (2π * 1 m * sqrt((1 m)² + x²))\n\nB = ∫[-0.5 to 0.5] (10⁻⁶ T * dx) / sqrt(1 + x²)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a numerical integration method, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. Using a numerical integration calculator, we get:\n\nB ≈ 1.96 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P located 1 meter away from the center of the sheet and perpendicular to its surface is approximately 1.96 × 10⁻⁶ T (Tesla)."
