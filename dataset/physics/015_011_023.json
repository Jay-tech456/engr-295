    "message_2": "The Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) are proposed third-generation gravitational wave observatories that aim to significantly improve the sensitivity of current detectors like LIGO and Virgo. With this increased sensitivity, the detection rate of gravitational wave events is expected to be much higher than the current rate.\n\nThe expected detection rate depends on the types of sources and their abundance in the universe. The main sources of gravitational waves are compact binary coalescences, which include binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and mixed neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). Other potential sources include supernovae, continuous waves from rotating neutron stars, and stochastic background from the early universe or unresolved compact binaries.\n\nFor the Einstein Telescope, the expected detection rates are as follows:\n\n1. Binary black holes (BBH): Up to several million detections per year.\n2. Binary neutron stars (BNS): Up to several hundred thousand detections per year.\n3. Neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH): Up to several tens of thousands of detections per year.\n\nFor the Cosmic Explorer, the expected detection rates are:\n\n1. Binary black holes (BBH): Up to several hundred thousand detections per year.\n2. Binary neutron stars (BNS): Up to several tens of thousands of detections per year.\n3. Neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH): Up to several thousand detections per year.\n\nThese numbers are rough estimates and depend on various factors, such as the actual sensitivity achieved by the detectors, the distribution of source parameters (masses, spins, etc.), and the cosmic evolution of the source populations. Additionally, the detection of other sources like supernovae and continuous waves will depend on the specifics of the sources and the sensitivity of the detectors at different frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer are expected to significantly increase the detection rate of gravitational wave events, potentially reaching millions of detections per year for binary black holes and hundreds of thousands of detections per year for binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries. This will greatly enhance our understanding of the universe and provide new insights into the fundamental physics of gravity."
