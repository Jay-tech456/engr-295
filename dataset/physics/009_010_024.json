    "message_2": "To determine the magnification and image distance, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.\n\nGiven, the focal length (f) is 15 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm. Plugging these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/v - 1/30\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(2 - 1)/30 = 1/v\n1/30 = 1/v\n\nSo, v = 30 cm.\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nM = -30/30\n\nM = -1\n\nThe magnification of the lens is -1, which means the image is inverted and the same size as the object. The image distance is 30 cm."
