    "message_2": "The central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), has an approximate mass of 4.1 million solar masses (where one solar mass is equal to the mass of our Sun). The size of the event horizon, or the Schwarzschild radius, of Sgr A* is estimated to be around 12.4 million kilometers (7.7 million miles), which is about 17 times the radius of the Sun.\n\nThe evidence supporting the existence of Sgr A* comes from various observations and studies:\n\n1. Stellar orbits: Astronomers have observed the motion of stars near the center of the Milky Way. The stars exhibit rapid orbits around an invisible point, indicating the presence of a massive object, such as a supermassive black hole, exerting a strong gravitational force on them.\n\n2. Radio and X-ray emissions: Sgr A* emits radio waves and X-rays, which are detected by radio telescopes and X-ray observatories. These emissions are consistent with the characteristics of a supermassive black hole.\n\n3. Gravitational lensing: The strong gravitational field of Sgr A* bends the light from background stars, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This effect has been observed and is consistent with the presence of a massive object like a black hole.\n\n4. Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations: In 2019, the EHT collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole, which was located in the galaxy M87. Although this was not an image of Sgr A*, it provided further evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, including the Milky Way."
