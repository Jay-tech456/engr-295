    "message_1": "A pair of twins, Anna and Bella, are born on Earth. Anna stays on Earth, while Bella travels in a spacecraft at a speed of 0.8c to a planet 12 light-years away and then returns to Earth. When Bella returns, she is surprised to find that Anna has aged more than she has, despite the fact that Bella was in motion for a longer period of time. How much time did each twin experience during the trip, and how much did their clocks measure time elapsed?",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the twin paradox in special relativity. To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation. Time dilation occurs due to the relative motion between two observers, and it can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time experienced by the moving observer (Bella), Δt is the time experienced by the stationary observer (Anna), v is the relative velocity between the observers (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the time it takes for Bella to travel to the planet and back, as experienced by Anna. Since the distance to the planet is 12 light-years and Bella is traveling at 0.8c, the time it takes for a one-way trip is:\n\nt_one_way = distance / speed = 12 light-years / 0.8c ≈ 15 years\n\nSince Bella has to travel back to Earth, the total time experienced by Anna is:\n\nΔt = 2 * t_one_way = 2 * 15 years = 30 years\n\nNow, let's find the time experienced by Bella during her trip using the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2) = 30 years / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) ≈ 30 years / √(1 - 0.64) ≈ 30 years / √0.36 ≈ 30 years / 0.6 ≈ 50 years\n\nSo, Anna experienced 30 years during Bella's trip, while Bella experienced only 18 years. Their clocks would measure the time elapsed as 30 years for Anna and 18 years for Bella."
