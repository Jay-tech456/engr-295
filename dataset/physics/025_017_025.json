    "message_2": "The tensile strength of a lipid bilayer is not a fixed value, as it depends on various factors such as the composition of the lipids, temperature, and the presence of other molecules. However, experimental studies have shown that the tensile strength of lipid bilayers typically falls within the range of 10-50 mN/m (millinewtons per meter).\n\nWhen subjected to increasing mechanical stress, the lipid bilayer can undergo deformation and eventually rupture. The critical stress at which the bilayer ruptures is known as the lysis tension. The lysis tension also depends on the specific properties of the lipid bilayer and can vary between different types of lipids and environmental conditions.\n\nIn summary, the tensile strength of a lipid bilayer is not a constant value and depends on various factors. However, it typically falls within the range of 10-50 mN/m."
