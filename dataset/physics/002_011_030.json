    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the adiabatic process equation for an ideal gas:\n\nP₁ * V₁^γ = P₂ * V₂^γ\n\nwhere P₁ and V₁ are the initial pressure and volume, P₂ and V₂ are the final pressure and volume, and γ is the heat capacity ratio.\n\nWe are given the initial volume V₁ = 1.5 m³, the initial pressure P₁ = 1.2 x 10⁵ Pa, the final volume V₂ = 0.75 m³, and the heat capacity ratio γ = 1.4. We need to find the final pressure P₂ and then calculate the work done by the gas.\n\nUsing the adiabatic process equation:\n\nP₁ * V₁^γ = P₂ * V₂^γ\nP₂ = P₁ * (V₁^γ / V₂^γ)\n\nP₂ = (1.2 x 10⁵ Pa) * ((1.5 m³)^1.4 / (0.75 m³)^1.4)\nP₂ ≈ 3.43 x 10⁵ Pa\n\nNow that we have the final pressure, we can calculate the work done by the gas using the adiabatic work equation:\n\nW = (P₁ * V₁ - P₂ * V₂) / (γ - 1)\n\nW = ((1.2 x 10⁵ Pa) * (1.5 m³) - (3.43 x 10⁵ Pa) * (0.75 m³)) / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ -1.23 x 10⁵ J\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas, meaning it is an expansion. Therefore, the amount of work done by the gas in this adiabatic process is approximately 1.23 x 10⁵ J."
