    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of the scattered photons due to the Compton effect, we can use the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nHowever, we are not given the scattering angle (θ) in the problem. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact change in wavelength without this information.\n\nIf you provide the scattering angle, we can then calculate the change in wavelength of the scattered photons due to the Compton effect."
