    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Several leading theories propose different types of particles as the constituents of dark matter. Some of the prominent theories include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are heavy particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. WIMPs are predicted by supersymmetry, a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. Experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and direct detection experiments such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) and XENON1T aim to detect WIMPs.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are light, neutral particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are also considered as potential dark matter candidates. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) are two experiments designed to search for axions.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity. They are heavier than the known neutrinos and could be a component of dark matter. Experiments like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the MiniBooNE experiment are searching for evidence of sterile neutrinos.\n\n4. Primordial Black Holes: Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could contribute to the dark matter content of the universe. Observations of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer could provide insights into the existence of primordial black holes.\n\n5. Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM): This theory proposes that dark matter particles can interact with each other through a new force, in addition to gravity. This interaction could help explain some discrepancies between dark matter simulations and observations of galaxy clusters. Experiments like the LHC and the DarkLight experiment are searching for evidence of new forces that could be associated with SIDM.\n\nThese are just a few of the many theories and experiments related to dark matter. As our understanding of the universe and our experimental capabilities continue to advance, we may eventually uncover the true nature of dark matter and its role in the cosmos."
