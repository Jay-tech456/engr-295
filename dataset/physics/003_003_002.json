    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nFor a toroid, the magnetic field is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nN = 200 turns\nI = 2 A\nr = 0.03 m (since the point is located on the axis of the toroid, 0.03 m away from the center)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 200 * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 400 A) / (0.06 m)\n\nB ≈ (1.6 × 10^(-4) T * 400) / 0.06\n\nB ≈ 64 × 10^(-4) T\n\nB ≈ 6.4 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the toroid, 0.03 m away from the center, is approximately 6.4 × 10^(-3) T (tesla)."
