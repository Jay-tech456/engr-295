    "message_2": "The mass and rotational velocity of a collapsing star play crucial roles in the formation and properties of the resulting black hole. When a massive star reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a gravitational collapse, which leads to the formation of a black hole. The mass and rotational velocity of the star determine the characteristics of the black hole, such as its mass, angular momentum, and event horizon size.\n\n1. Mass: The mass of the collapsing star is directly related to the mass of the resulting black hole. According to the conservation of mass, the mass of the black hole will be equal to the mass of the collapsing star minus the mass lost during the supernova explosion (if any). A more massive star will result in a more massive black hole. The mass of the black hole is important because it determines the strength of its gravitational pull and the size of its event horizon (the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravity).\n\n2. Rotational velocity: The rotational velocity of the collapsing star affects the angular momentum of the resulting black hole. A faster-rotating star will result in a black hole with higher angular momentum. The angular momentum of a black hole is important because it influences the shape of the event horizon and the properties of the spacetime around the black hole. A non-rotating black hole (also known as a Schwarzschild black hole) has a spherical event horizon, while a rotating black hole (also known as a Kerr black hole) has an oblate event horizon, which is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nThe rotational velocity also affects the stability of the collapsing star. If the star is rotating too fast, it may not collapse into a black hole but instead form a different type of compact object, such as a neutron star or a white dwarf.\n\nIn summary, the mass and rotational velocity of a collapsing star are crucial factors that determine the formation and properties of the resulting black hole. The mass of the star influences the mass and gravitational pull of the black hole, while the rotational velocity affects its angular momentum and the shape of the event horizon."
