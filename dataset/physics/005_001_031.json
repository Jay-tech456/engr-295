    "message_1": "A spaceship travels away from Earth at a constant speed of 0.8c (80% of the speed of light) relative to an observer on Earth. The crew onboard measures that they have aged by 5 years during the trip. How much time has passed on Earth during this journey, according to the observer on Earth? Calculate the time dilation factor experienced by the crew.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by the crew, we will use the time dilation formula derived from the theory of special relativity:\n\nt = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time experienced by the observer on Earth, t0 is the time experienced by the crew onboard (5 years), v is the velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time dilation factor, which is the denominator of the equation:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.64) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the observer on Earth:\n\nt = t0 / (time dilation factor) = 5 years / 0.6 = 8.333 years\n\nSo, according to the observer on Earth, 8.333 years have passed during the journey. The time dilation factor experienced by the crew is 0.6."
