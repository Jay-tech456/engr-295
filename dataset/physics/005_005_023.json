Use the formula for gravitational time dilation.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect due to gravity, we can use the formula for gravitational time dilation, which is derived from the Schwarzschild metric in general relativity:\n\nΔt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - (2 * ΔU) / (c^2 * r))\n\nwhere:\nΔt' is the dilated time interval at the top of the skyscraper\nΔt is the time interval at the ground level\nΔU is the difference in gravitational potential energy between the two clocks (10 J)\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s)\nr is the distance from the center of the Earth to the top of the skyscraper\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance from the center of the Earth to the top of the skyscraper. The Earth's radius is approximately 6,371,000 meters. So, the distance from the center of the Earth to the top of the skyscraper is:\n\nr = 6,371,000 + 300 = 6,371,300 meters\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nΔt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - (2 * 10) / ( (3 * 10^8)^2 * 6,371,300))\n\nΔt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - (20) / (9 * 10^16 * 6,371,300))\n\nΔt' ≈ Δt * sqrt(1 - 3.52 * 10^(-16))\n\nSince the value inside the square root is very close to 1, the time dilation effect is extremely small. To find the difference in time, we can use the formula:\n\nΔt_diff = Δt - Δt'\n\nFor a time interval of 1 second (Δt = 1 s), the difference in time would be:\n\nΔt_diff = 1 - 1 * sqrt(1 - 3.52 * 10^(-16))\n\nΔt_diff ≈ 1.76 * 10^(-17) seconds\n\nSo, the clock at the top of the skyscraper would run longer by approximately 1.76 * 10^(-17) seconds compared to the clock at the ground level for every second. This difference is extremely small and practically negligible in everyday life."
