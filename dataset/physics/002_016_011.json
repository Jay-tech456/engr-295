The gas has a known critical pressure of 30 atmospheres and critical volume of 70 cubic meters. What is the critical temperature of the gas sample?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical temperature of the gas sample, we can use the reduced equation of state for a real gas:\n\nP_r = P / P_c\nV_r = V / V_c\nT_r = T / T_c\n\nWhere P_r, V_r, and T_r are the reduced pressure, volume, and temperature, respectively; P, V, and T are the actual pressure, volume, and temperature; and P_c, V_c, and T_c are the critical pressure, volume, and temperature.\n\nWe are given the actual pressure (P) and volume (V) of the gas sample, as well as the critical pressure (P_c) and volume (V_c). We can use these values to find the reduced pressure and volume:\n\nP_r = P / P_c = 20 atm / 30 atm = 2/3\nV_r = V / V_c = 50 m³ / 70 m³ = 5/7\n\nNow, we can use the reduced equation of state for a real gas, which is given by the van der Waals equation in reduced form:\n\n(P_r + 3 * V_r^2) * (3 * V_r - 1) = 8 * T_r\n\nPlugging in the values for P_r and V_r:\n\n(2/3 + 3 * (5/7)^2) * (3 * 5/7 - 1) = 8 * T_r\n\nSolving for T_r:\n\n(2/3 + 3 * 25/49) * (15/7 - 1) = 8 * T_r\n(2/3 + 75/49) * (8/7) = 8 * T_r\n(98 + 225) / 147 * 8/7 = 8 * T_r\n323 / 147 * 8/7 = 8 * T_r\n\nNow, we can solve for T_c:\n\nT_c = T / T_r\nT_c = 8 * T_r * 7/8\nT_c = 7 * 323 / 147\n\nT_c ≈ 15.34 K\n\nThe critical temperature of the gas sample is approximately 15.34 K."
