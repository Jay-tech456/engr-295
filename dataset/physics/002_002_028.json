Find the final temperature of the system assuming that there is no heat loss to the surroundings. (Specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J/gK and specific heat capacity of the metal block = 0.5 J/gK )",
    "message_2": "To find the final temperature of the system, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat gained by the water should be equal to the heat lost by the metal block.\n\nLet the final temperature of the system be Tf.\n\nHeat gained by water (Q_water) = mass of water (m_water) × specific heat capacity of water (c_water) × change in temperature of water (ΔT_water)\nQ_water = m_water × c_water × (Tf - T_initial_water)\n\nHeat lost by metal block (Q_metal) = mass of metal (m_metal) × specific heat capacity of metal (c_metal) × change in temperature of metal (ΔT_metal)\nQ_metal = m_metal × c_metal × (T_initial_metal - Tf)\n\nSince there is no heat loss to the surroundings, Q_water = Q_metal.\n\nm_water × c_water × (Tf - T_initial_water) = m_metal × c_metal × (T_initial_metal - Tf)\n\nGiven values:\nm_water = 1 kg = 1000 g\nT_initial_water = 300 K\nc_water = 4.18 J/gK\n\nm_metal = 2 kg = 2000 g\nT_initial_metal = 800 K\nc_metal = 0.5 J/gK\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n1000 × 4.18 × (Tf - 300) = 2000 × 0.5 × (800 - Tf)\n\nSolving for Tf:\n\n4180 × (Tf - 300) = 1000 × (800 - Tf)\n\n4180Tf - 1254000 = 800000 - 1000Tf\n\n5180Tf = 2054000\n\nTf = 2054000 / 5180\n\nTf ≈ 396.53 K\n\nThe final temperature of the system is approximately 396.53 K."
