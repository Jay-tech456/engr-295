    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (c) relative to an observer. In this case, the student is moving at 0.99c relative to their twin sibling on Earth.\n\nThe time dilation formula is given by:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the time experienced by the moving observer (the student), t is the time experienced by the stationary observer (the twin sibling on Earth), v is the relative velocity (0.99c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the time it takes for the student to travel to the star system and back to Earth as measured by the twin sibling on Earth. The total distance for the round trip is 20 light-years (10 light-years each way). Since the student is traveling at 0.99c, we can calculate the time as follows:\n\nt = distance / speed\nt = 20 light-years / 0.99c\nt ≈ 20.2 years\n\nNow, let's find the time experienced by the student during this journey using the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nt' = 20.2 years / sqrt(1 - (0.99c)^2/c^2)\nt' ≈ 20.2 years / sqrt(1 - 0.9801)\nt' ≈ 20.2 years / sqrt(0.0199)\nt' ≈ 20.2 years / 0.1411\nt' ≈ 143.2 years\n\nThe student experiences 143.2 years during their journey, while their twin sibling on Earth experiences 20.2 years. Therefore, the difference in their ages when the student returns to Earth is:\n\nAge difference = 20.2 years - 143.2 years\nAge difference ≈ -123 years\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the absolute difference in their ages, we can ignore the negative sign:\n\nAge difference ≈ 123 years\n\nSo, the ages of the siblings will differ by approximately 123 years when the student returns to Earth."
