    "message_1": "A rectangular wooden block of dimensions 20 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm is floating in a beaker of water. If the density of the wooden block is 0.6 g/cm^3, what is the distance from the bottom of the block to the water surface?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the submerged part of the wooden block. Since the block is floating, the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the block.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume and weight of the wooden block:\n\nVolume = length × width × height\nVolume = 20 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm = 1000 cm³\n\nWeight = volume × density\nWeight = 1000 cm³ × 0.6 g/cm³ = 600 g\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the submerged part of the block. The buoyant force acting on the block is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the submerged part of the block. The density of water is 1 g/cm³.\n\nBuoyant force = weight of displaced water = weight of the block\nVolume_submerged × density_water = weight_block\n\nVolume_submerged = weight_block / density_water\nVolume_submerged = 600 g / 1 g/cm³ = 600 cm³\n\nSince the block has a rectangular shape, the ratio of the submerged volume to the total volume of the block is equal to the ratio of the submerged height to the total height of the block.\n\nRatio = Volume_submerged / Volume_total = Height_submerged / Height_total\n\nHeight_submerged = Ratio × Height_total\nHeight_submerged = (600 cm³ / 1000 cm³) × 5 cm = 3 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the distance from the bottom of the block to the water surface:\n\nDistance = Height_total - Height_submerged\nDistance = 5 cm - 3 cm = 2 cm\n\nSo, the distance from the bottom of the block to the water surface is 2 cm."
