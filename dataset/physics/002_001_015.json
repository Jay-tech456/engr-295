    "message_1": "A 2.5 kg metal block is heated from 20°C to 50°C. During this process, the block expands and pushes a piston with an external pressure of 1.5 atm. Calculate the work done by the metal block during this thermodynamic process. (Assume that the volume of the piston remains constant.)",
    "message_2": "Since the volume of the piston remains constant during the heating process, the work done by the metal block can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = -P_ext * ΔV\n\nwhere W is the work done, P_ext is the external pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.\n\nHowever, we are not given the change in volume (ΔV) directly. To find the change in volume, we need to know the coefficient of linear expansion (α) of the metal and the initial volume (V_initial) of the block.\n\nThe formula for the change in volume due to the temperature change is:\n\nΔV = V_initial * (1 + α * ΔT) - V_initial\n\nwhere ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nWe are not given the coefficient of linear expansion (α) and the initial volume (V_initial) of the metal block, so we cannot calculate the work done by the metal block during this thermodynamic process without this information."
