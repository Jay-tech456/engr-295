    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nn = (4 atm * 2 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * 300 K)\n\nn ≈ 0.326 moles\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nW = (0.326 moles * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * 300 K) * ln(10 L / 2 L)\n\nW ≈ 8.05 atm L * ln(5)\n\nW ≈ 8.05 atm L * 1.609\n\nW ≈ 12.95 atm L\n\nThe work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 12.95 atm L."
