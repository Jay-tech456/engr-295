    "message_1": "A student wants to measure the activity of a radioactive source using a scintillation counter. The source is emitting alpha particles with an energy of 5 MeV. The detector has an efficiency of 40% for alpha particles at that energy. If the instrument measures an average count rate of 100 counts per minute, what is the activity of the source in becquerels?",
    "message_2": "To find the activity of the source in becquerels, we first need to determine the actual count rate of the alpha particles being emitted by the source, taking into account the efficiency of the detector.\n\nThe detector has an efficiency of 40%, which means that it detects 40% of the alpha particles emitted by the source. If the instrument measures an average count rate of 100 counts per minute, we can calculate the actual count rate as follows:\n\nActual count rate = Measured count rate / Detector efficiency\nActual count rate = 100 counts per minute / 0.40\nActual count rate = 250 counts per minute\n\nNow, we need to convert the count rate from counts per minute to becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq is equal to 1 count per second:\n\nActual count rate in Bq = Actual count rate in counts per minute / 60 seconds per minute\nActual count rate in Bq = 250 counts per minute / 60 seconds per minute\nActual count rate in Bq = 4.1667 counts per second\n\nTherefore, the activity of the source is approximately 4.17 Bq."
