    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is the radius of this event horizon and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses, we can calculate its Schwarzschild radius. One solar mass (Ms) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole (M) is 10Ms = 1.989 x 10^31 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nRs = (2 x 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 x 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of the black hole is approximately 29.5 kilometers, which is also its Schwarzschild radius.\n\nAs for the specific observational evidence for the existence of black holes, there are several lines of evidence:\n\n1. Gravitational waves: The detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo observatories has provided strong evidence for the existence of black holes. These waves are produced by the merging of black holes and other massive objects, and their detection is consistent with theoretical predictions.\n\n2. X-ray emissions: When a black hole is part of a binary system with a companion star, it can accrete matter from the star. This process generates X-ray emissions that can be detected by X-ray observatories, such as Chandra and XMM-Newton. The observed X-ray emissions and their properties are consistent with the presence of black holes.\n\n3. Stellar motions: The motion of stars near the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, provides indirect evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole. The stars' orbits are consistent with the presence of a massive, compact object, which is believed to be a black hole with a mass of around 4 million solar masses.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: Black holes can bend light due to their strong gravitational fields, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Observations of lensing events, such as the famous \"Einstein Cross,\" provide indirect evidence for the existence of black holes.\n\n5. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has recently provided the first direct visual evidence of a black hole by capturing an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. The observed features, such as the black hole's shadow and the surrounding accretion disk, are consistent with theoretical predictions."
