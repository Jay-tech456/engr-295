    "message_2": "To calculate the expected strain amplitude of gravitational waves (GW) from a cosmic string network, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = Gμ / (f * L)\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^(-11) m³ kg^(-1) s^(-2)), μ is the linear mass density (which is related to the string tension T by μ = T/c^2, where c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s), f is the frequency of the GW (100 Hz in this case), and L is the distance between the cosmic string and the detector.\n\nFirst, let's find the linear mass density μ:\n\nμ = T/c^2 = (10^(-7)) / (3 × 10^8)^2 = 10^(-7) / 9 × 10^16 = 1.111 × 10^(-24) kg/m\n\nNow, we need to find the distance L between the cosmic string and the detector. We can use the instrumental sensitivity (10^(-23)) to estimate the distance. The sensitivity is related to the strain amplitude by:\n\nsensitivity = h * sqrt(f)\n\nRearranging for h:\n\nh = sensitivity / sqrt(f) = 10^(-23) / sqrt(100) = 10^(-23) / 10 = 10^(-24)\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the strain amplitude to find the distance L:\n\nh = Gμ / (f * L)\n\nRearranging for L:\n\nL = Gμ / (h * f) = (6.674 × 10^(-11) * 1.111 × 10^(-24)) / (10^(-24) * 100) = 6.674 × 10^(-11) / 100 = 6.674 × 10^(-13) m\n\nNow that we have the distance L, we can calculate the expected strain amplitude of the gravitational waves detectable from the cosmic string network:\n\nh = Gμ / (f * L) = (6.674 × 10^(-11) * 1.111 × 10^(-24)) / (100 * 6.674 × 10^(-13)) = 1.111 × 10^(-24)\n\nSo, the expected strain amplitude of gravitational waves detectable from a cosmic string network with a tension of 10^(-7) in units of hertz to the 1/2 power, assuming a frequency of 100 Hz and an instrumental sensitivity of 10^(-23), is approximately 1.111 × 10^(-24)."
