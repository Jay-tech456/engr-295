    "message_2": "To find the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of the water, we can use the following formula:\n\nGauge pressure = ρ * g * h\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid (water), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the fluid column.\n\nGiven the density of water (ρ) is 1000 kg/m³, the height of the water column (h) is 2 meters, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.81 m/s², we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nGauge pressure = (1000 kg/m³) * (9.81 m/s²) * (2 m)\n\nGauge pressure = 19,620 kg m²/s² m³\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m²/s² m³, the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of the water is:\n\nGauge pressure = 19,620 Pa"
