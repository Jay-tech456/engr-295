    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant.\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for n and T. But we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we have:\n\n(5 atm) * (2.5 L) = n * R * T\n\nNow, we can use the final conditions to find the relationship between the initial and final number of moles and temperature:\n\n(5 atm) * (5.5 L) = n * R * T\n\nDivide the initial condition equation by the final condition equation:\n\n(5 * 2.5) / (5 * 5.5) = n * R * T / n * R * T\n\n0.4545 = 1\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature and the number of moles remain constant. Therefore, we can use the initial condition equation to find the value of n * R * T:\n\nn * R * T = (5 atm) * (2.5 L)\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\nW = -(5 * 2.5) * ln(5.5 / 2.5)\nW = -12.5 * ln(2.2)\nW ≈ -12.5 * 0.7885\nW ≈ -9.856 J\n\nThe work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately -9.856 J. The negative sign indicates that the work was done by the gas on the surroundings."
