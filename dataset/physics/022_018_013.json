    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are one of the proposed candidates for dark matter. They are non-luminous objects like brown dwarfs, black holes, or neutron stars that do not emit significant amounts of light but still contribute to the overall mass of a galaxy.\n\nTo estimate the number of MACHOs in a galaxy, we need to make some assumptions about the average mass of a MACHO. Let's assume the average mass of a MACHO is about 1 solar mass (the mass of our Sun). This is a rough estimate, as MACHOs can have a wide range of masses.\n\nGiven that the total mass of the galaxy is 10^12 solar masses and we are assuming MACHOs make up 100% of the dark matter, we can simply divide the total mass of the galaxy by the average mass of a MACHO to find the number of MACHOs.\n\nNumber of MACHOs = (Total mass of the galaxy) / (Average mass of a MACHO)\nNumber of MACHOs = (10^12 solar masses) / (1 solar mass)\nNumber of MACHOs = 10^12\n\nSo, there would be approximately 10^12 MACHOs in the galaxy if they make up 100% of the dark matter and have an average mass of 1 solar mass. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and the actual number could be different depending on the true nature and distribution of MACHOs."
