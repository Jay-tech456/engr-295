    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point, causing the image to appear blurry. To minimize the effect of spherical aberration, we can use the paraxial approximation, which assumes that light rays are close to the optical axis and make small angles with it.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the focal length (f) of the lens and the spherical aberration (SA). We need to find the object distance (u) that will result in a sharp image on the screen.\n\nUsing the lens formula, we have:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nTo minimize the effect of spherical aberration, we want the image distance (v) to be equal to the spherical aberration (SA). So, v = SA = 2 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/u + 1/2\n\nTo solve for u, we first find the common denominator:\n\n2/20 = 1/u + 10/20\n\nNow, subtract 10/20 from both sides:\n\n-8/20 = 1/u\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nu = -20/8\n\nHowever, the object distance cannot be negative. This means that it is not possible to place the object at a distance that will result in a sharp image on the screen due to the spherical aberration of the lens. In practice, one would need to use a lens with a smaller spherical aberration or employ additional corrective measures, such as using an aspheric lens or a combination of lenses, to obtain a sharp image."
