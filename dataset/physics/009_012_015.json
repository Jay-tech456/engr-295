    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and size, we can use the thin lens equation and the magnification formula. The thin lens equation is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 20 cm and the object distance do = 25 cm, we can solve for the image distance di:\n\n1/20 = 1/25 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(25 + 20) / (20 * 25) = 1/di\n\n45 / 500 = 1/di\n\nNow, we can find di by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 500 / 45\n\ndi ≈ 11.11 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is approximately 11.11 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nM = -11.11 / 25\n\nM ≈ -0.444\n\nThe magnification is approximately -0.444, which means the image is inverted and reduced in size compared to the object.\n\nTo find the image size, we can multiply the magnification by the object size. Let's assume the object size is h_o:\n\nh_i = M * h_o\n\nh_i ≈ -0.444 * h_o\n\nThe image size (h_i) is approximately 0.444 times the object size (h_o) and inverted."
