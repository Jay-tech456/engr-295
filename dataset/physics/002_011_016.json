The gas is assumed to be monoatomic (i.e., it has only one particle per molecule). The specific heat at constant volume for the gas is 3/2 R.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the adiabatic process equation and the work done equation. For an adiabatic process, the equation is:\n\nPV^γ = constant\n\nwhere P is pressure, V is volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index, which is the ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv). For a monoatomic gas, γ = 5/3.\n\nFirst, let's convert the initial pressure from atm to Pa (Pascals):\n\nP1 = 2.0 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 202650 Pa\n\nNow, let's convert the initial and final volumes from L to m^3:\n\nV1 = 3.0 L * (1 m^3 / 1000 L) = 0.003 m^3\nV2 = 5.0 L * (1 m^3 / 1000 L) = 0.005 m^3\n\nUsing the adiabatic process equation, we can find the final pressure (P2):\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ = 202650 * (0.003/0.005)^(5/3) = 101325 Pa\n\nNow, we can find the work done by the gas during the process using the work done equation for an adiabatic process:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nW = (202650 * 0.003 - 101325 * 0.005) / (5/3 - 1) = (607.95 - 506.625) / (2/3) = 151.95 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion is approximately 151.95 Joules."
