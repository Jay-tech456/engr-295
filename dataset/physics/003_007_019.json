    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a straight rod carrying a current of 2 A and having a length of 50 cm, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the Biot-Savart Law is more suitable for infinitely long wires, we will use Ampere's Law instead, which is more appropriate for finite-length wires.\n\nAmpere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (2 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (0.05 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.05 m\n\nB ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the straight rod carrying a current of 2 A and having a length of 50 cm is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
