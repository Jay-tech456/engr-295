    "message_2": "To calculate the force experienced by an electron traveling at 0.8c in a magnetic field of 1 T directed perpendicular to its velocity, we can use the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF = q * (v x B)\n\nwhere F is the force, q is the charge of the electron, v is the velocity of the electron, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nThe charge of an electron (q) is -1.6 x 10^-19 C, the velocity (v) is 0.8 times the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s), and the magnetic field (B) is 1 T.\n\nv = 0.8c = 0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the velocity, the cross product (v x B) is simply the product of their magnitudes:\n\nv x B = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s * 1 T = 2.4 x 10^8 T*m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the force:\n\nF = q * (v x B) = (-1.6 x 10^-19 C) * (2.4 x 10^8 T*m/s) = -3.84 x 10^-11 N\n\nThe force experienced by the electron is -3.84 x 10^-11 N, with the negative sign indicating that the force is in the opposite direction of the electron's charge."
