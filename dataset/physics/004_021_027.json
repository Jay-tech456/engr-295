    "message_2": "The mass of a star plays a crucial role in determining its ultimate fate during the gravitational collapse process according to the theory of general relativity. The life cycle of a star can be broadly divided into three categories based on its mass: low-mass stars (less than 3 solar masses), intermediate-mass stars (between 3 and 8 solar masses), and high-mass stars (greater than 8 solar masses). Each of these categories leads to a different end state after the gravitational collapse.\n\n1. Low-mass stars (< 3 solar masses):\nThese stars, including our Sun, undergo nuclear fusion in their cores, converting hydrogen into helium. Once the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, the core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers to expand, and the star becomes a red giant. Eventually, the core becomes hot enough for helium to fuse into carbon and oxygen. When the helium is exhausted, the core contracts again, but this time, the star's mass is not sufficient to generate the temperatures required for further fusion. The outer layers are shed off, forming a planetary nebula, and the core remains as a white dwarf, which eventually cools down and becomes a black dwarf.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass stars (3 - 8 solar masses):\nThese stars follow a similar path as low-mass stars, but their higher mass allows them to fuse heavier elements in their cores. After helium fusion, the core contracts and heats up, allowing carbon to fuse into neon, magnesium, and oxygen. This process continues until the core is primarily composed of iron. At this point, the core cannot generate energy through fusion, as iron fusion is endothermic rather than exothermic. The core collapses under its own gravity, and the outer layers fall inward, resulting in a supernova explosion (Type II supernova). The remnant core left behind becomes a neutron star, which is supported by neutron degeneracy pressure.\n\n3. High-mass stars (> 8 solar masses):\nHigh-mass stars undergo a similar process as intermediate-mass stars, fusing elements up to iron in their cores. However, their higher mass leads to a more dramatic end. When the iron core collapses, the infalling outer layers rebound off the core, producing a supernova explosion (Type II supernova). If the remaining core mass is between 3 and 20 solar masses, it will form a neutron star, supported by neutron degeneracy pressure. However, if the core mass exceeds 20 solar masses, the gravitational force is so strong that not even neutron degeneracy pressure can counteract it. In this case, the core collapses further, forming a black hole, an object so dense that its escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.\n\nIn summary, the mass of a star determines its ultimate fate during the gravitational collapse process. Low-mass stars end up as white dwarfs, intermediate-mass stars result in neutron stars, and high-mass stars lead to the formation of black holes. The theory of general relativity plays a crucial role in describing the behavior of these objects, especially black holes, where the curvature of spacetime becomes extreme due to the intense gravitational force."
