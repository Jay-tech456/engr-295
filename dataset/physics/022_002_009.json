    "message_2": "The approximate abundance of dark matter in the universe is about 27%. This means that around 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe is made up of dark matter, while the remaining 73% is dark energy, and only about 5% is ordinary visible matter (such as stars, planets, and gas).\n\nScientists infer the existence of dark matter through its gravitational effects on visible matter because dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect light. However, it does interact gravitationally with visible matter, and this interaction can be observed in several ways:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation speeds of stars and gas in galaxies do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible mass distribution. Instead, the rotation curves remain flat or even increase with distance from the galactic center, suggesting the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, can be used to infer the mass distribution of the object. Observations show that the mass inferred from gravitational lensing is much greater than the mass of visible matter, indicating the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies: The temperature fluctuations in the CMB, which is the relic radiation from the early universe, provide information about the distribution of matter and energy at that time. The observed pattern of anisotropies is consistent with a universe composed of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in the proportions mentioned earlier.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps to form these structures. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThese lines of evidence, among others, strongly suggest the existence of dark matter and its significant contribution to the overall mass-energy content of the universe."
