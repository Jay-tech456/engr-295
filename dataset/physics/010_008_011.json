If the sphere experiences a gravitational force of 790 N downwards, what is the net force acting on the sphere? Will the sphere sink or float?",
    "message_2": "To determine the buoyant force acting on the sphere, we need to find the volume of the sphere and the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.\n\nThe volume of the sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (0.2 m)³\nV ≈ 0.0335 m³\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of the water displaced by the sphere. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. We can use the formula:\n\nmass of water displaced = density of water * volume of sphere\n\nmass of water displaced = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.0335 m³\nmass of water displaced ≈ 33.5 kg\n\nNow, we can find the buoyant force (F_b) using the formula:\n\nF_b = mass of water displaced * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nF_b = 33.5 kg * 9.81 m/s²\nF_b ≈ 328.215 N\n\nThe net force acting on the sphere can be calculated by subtracting the buoyant force from the gravitational force:\n\nNet force = Gravitational force - Buoyant force\nNet force = 790 N - 328.215 N\nNet force ≈ 461.785 N\n\nSince the net force is positive and acting downwards, the sphere will sink in the water."
