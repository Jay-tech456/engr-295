    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P on the axis of a circular disc of radius R and current I, located a distance z away from the center of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB created by a small segment of wire carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (Idl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince we are dealing with a circular disc, we can consider a small ring of radius r' and thickness dr' on the disc. The circumference of this ring is 2πr', and the current flowing through it is I. The magnetic field created by this small ring at point P can be expressed as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2πr' * I * dr' * sinθ) / (r'² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the position vector r and the z-axis.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over the entire disc to find the total magnetic field at point P. The limits of integration for r' will be from 0 to R:\n\nB = ∫[0, R] (μ₀ / 4π) * (2πr' * I * dr' * sinθ) / (r'² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nSince sinθ = r' / sqrt(r'² + z²), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * ∫[0, R] (r' * dr') / (r'² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can substitute u = r'² + z² and du = 2r' * dr':\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4z) * ∫[z², R² + z²] (du) / u^(3/2)\n\nIntegrating with respect to u, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4z) * [-2 * u^(-1/2)] [z², R² + z²]\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4z) * [2 * (z / sqrt(R² + z²) - 1)]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * (1 - z / sqrt(R² + z²))\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is along the axis of the circular disc, perpendicular to the plane of the disc. If the current flows in the clockwise direction when viewed from above, the magnetic field will be in the positive z-direction, and if the current flows in the counterclockwise direction, the magnetic field will be in the negative z-direction.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field created at point P on the axis of a circular disc of radius R and current I, located a distance z away from the center of the disc, is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 2) * (1 - z / sqrt(R² + z²))\n\nAnd the direction is along the axis of the circular disc, perpendicular to the plane of the disc, either in the positive or negative z-direction, depending on the direction of the current flow."
