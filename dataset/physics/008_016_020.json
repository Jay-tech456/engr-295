    "message_2": "There are several lines of experimental evidence that support the existence of dark matter, which is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light and is therefore invisible to electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, and its presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe. Some of the key experimental evidence for dark matter includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass of the galaxy. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a large amount of unseen mass, or dark matter, in the galaxy's halo.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the cluster. These studies have shown that the mass distribution is not consistent with the distribution of visible matter, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations have allowed scientists to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. These measurements are consistent with the presence of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that holds these structures together.\n\n5. Computer simulations: Simulations of the formation and evolution of the universe, which include the effects of dark matter, are able to reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the universe and the properties of individual galaxies.\n\nThe existence of dark matter challenges the current understanding of the Standard Model in particle physics because it implies the presence of particles that do not interact with the electromagnetic force and are therefore not included in the Standard Model. This has led to the proposal of various extensions to the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions, which predict the existence of new particles that could be candidates for dark matter. Direct detection experiments, such as those using underground detectors to search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei, and indirect detection experiments, such as those using telescopes to search for the products of dark matter particle annihilations, are ongoing in an effort to identify the nature of dark matter and its connection to the fundamental laws of physics."
