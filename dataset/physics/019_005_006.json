    "message_2": "To calculate the decay rate of a particle undergoing a specific process in quantum field theory, we need to consider the transition amplitude between the initial and final states. This transition amplitude is given by the S-matrix element, which can be calculated using Feynman diagrams and the corresponding Feynman rules for the specific theory.\n\nThe decay rate (Γ) is related to the transition probability per unit time. For a 1-to-n particle decay process, the decay rate can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΓ = (1 / 2E₁) * ∫ |S-matrix element|^2 * (2π)^4 * δ^4(P_initial - P_final) * Π_i [d^3p_i / (2π)^3 * 2E_i],\n\nwhere\n- E₁ is the energy of the initial particle,\n- P_initial and P_final are the 4-momenta of the initial and final states, respectively,\n- δ^4 is the 4-dimensional Dirac delta function,\n- the integral is taken over the phase space of the final state particles,\n- the product Π_i is taken over all final state particles, and\n- d^3p_i is the differential 3-momentum of the final state particles.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the specific process and the corresponding quantum field theory.\n2. Determine the initial and final states of the particle decay.\n3. Calculate the S-matrix element using Feynman diagrams and Feynman rules.\n4. Compute the phase space integral for the final state particles.\n5. Plug the S-matrix element and phase space integral into the decay rate formula and evaluate the integral.\n\nNote that this is a general outline, and the specific calculations will depend on the details of the particle decay process and the quantum field theory involved."
