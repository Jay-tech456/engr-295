    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we need to consider the bond energies of the reactants and products. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n2 H₂ (g) + O₂ (g) → 2 H₂O (g)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total bond energy of the reactants:\n\n2 moles of H₂: 2 × 436 kJ/mol = 872 kJ\n1 mole of O₂: 1 × 498 kJ/mol = 498 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy of reactants = 872 kJ + 498 kJ = 1370 kJ\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bond energy of the products:\n\n2 moles of H₂O: 2 × 2 × 464 kJ/mol = 1856 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy of products = 1856 kJ\n\nFinally, we can calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction:\n\nΔH = Total bond energy of products - Total bond energy of reactants\nΔH = 1856 kJ - 1370 kJ = 486 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is 486 kJ."
