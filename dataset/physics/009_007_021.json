    "message_2": "To calculate the position of the image formed, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, the focal length f = 10 cm and the object distance u = 20 cm. We can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(1/10) - (1/20) = 1/v\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions:\n\n(2 - 1) / 20 = 1/v\n\n1/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed 20 cm away from the lens.\n\nTo determine if the image is real or virtual, we can look at the sign of the image distance v. In this case, v is positive, which means the image is real. If v were negative, the image would be virtual.\n\nTherefore, the image formed is real and is located 20 cm away from the lens."
