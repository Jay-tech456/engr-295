    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 30 cm in front of the mirror. Determine the image distance, magnification, and whether the image is real or virtual.",
    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 20 cm, do = 30 cm\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n60 = 3*di + 2*di\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\n60 = 5*di\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ndi = 12 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is 12 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification using the formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -12/30\n\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification is -0.4, which means the image is inverted and 0.4 times the size of the object.\n\nSince the magnification is negative and the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted."
