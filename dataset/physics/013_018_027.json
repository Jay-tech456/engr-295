    "message_1": "What is the average annual dose of cosmic ray background radiation that a human is exposed to, and how does it compare to the maximum recommended dose for radiation workers? Additionally, what are the potential effects of long-term exposure to high levels of cosmic ray background radiation on human health?",
    "message_2": "The average annual dose of cosmic ray background radiation that a human is exposed to is approximately 0.3 millisieverts (mSv) per year. This value can vary depending on factors such as altitude and geographical location. For comparison, the maximum recommended dose for radiation workers is 50 mSv per year, as per the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) guidelines. This means that the average annual dose of cosmic ray background radiation is significantly lower than the recommended limit for radiation workers.\n\nLong-term exposure to high levels of cosmic ray background radiation can have potential effects on human health. The primary concern is the increased risk of cancer, as ionizing radiation can damage DNA and lead to mutations. The risk of cancer increases with the cumulative dose of radiation received over a lifetime. Other potential health effects include cataracts, cardiovascular diseases, and hereditary effects, although these are less common and typically associated with higher doses of radiation.\n\nIt is important to note that the average annual dose of cosmic ray background radiation is relatively low compared to other sources of natural background radiation (such as radon) and is generally not considered a significant health risk for the general population. However, for certain groups of people, such as astronauts and high-altitude pilots, the exposure to cosmic ray background radiation can be significantly higher, and appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the risks associated with this exposure."
