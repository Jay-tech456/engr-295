    "message_2": "The expected decay rate of the Higgs boson to two Z bosons (H → ZZ) is approximately 2.7% of all Higgs boson decays. This decay channel is one of the primary ways to study the properties of the Higgs boson and confirm its existence.\n\nTo measure this decay rate accurately using the ATLAS detector at the LHC, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Collision events: The LHC accelerates and collides protons at high energies, producing a large number of particles, including the Higgs boson. The ATLAS detector is designed to detect and measure these particles.\n\n2. Identifying the decay products: In the H → ZZ decay channel, the two Z bosons can further decay into various particles. One common decay mode is Z → l+l- (where l represents a lepton, such as an electron or muon). By identifying and measuring the momenta of these leptons, the ATLAS detector can reconstruct the invariant mass of the Z bosons and, subsequently, the Higgs boson.\n\n3. Background reduction: There are many other processes in proton-proton collisions that can produce similar final states as the H → ZZ decay. To accurately measure the decay rate, it is essential to reduce these background events. This can be done by applying selection criteria based on the properties of the detected particles, such as their momenta, isolation, and the topology of the event.\n\n4. Statistical analysis: Once the H → ZZ candidate events are selected, a statistical analysis is performed to extract the signal strength (the ratio of the observed Higgs boson production rate to the one predicted by the Standard Model) and the decay rate. This involves fitting the invariant mass distribution of the candidate events with a signal-plus-background model and estimating the uncertainties associated with the measurement.\n\n5. Systematic uncertainties: In addition to the statistical uncertainties, there are systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement, such as the detector response, the modeling of the signal and background processes, and the luminosity determination. These uncertainties need to be carefully estimated and incorporated into the final result.\n\nBy following these steps and combining the results with other decay channels, the ATLAS experiment can accurately measure the properties of the Higgs boson, including its decay rate to two Z bosons."
