    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this problem, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), and θ1 = 30 degrees.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.5 / 1.5 ≈ 0.3333\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.3333:\n\nθ2 ≈ arcsin(0.3333) ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 19.47 degrees.\n\nTo calculate the shift in the path of the beam as it enters the glass, we can use the formula:\n\nshift = t * (tan(θ1) - tan(θ2))\n\nwhere t is the thickness of the glass slab. However, the thickness of the glass slab is not provided in the problem. If you have the thickness, you can plug it into the formula along with the angles of incidence and refraction to find the shift."
