    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nWe are given the radius of curvature (R) as 20 cm. For a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half of the radius of curvature:\n\nf = R/2\nf = 20 cm / 2\nf = 10 cm\n\nNow, we are given that the real image is formed 5 cm from the mirror. Since it's a real image, the image distance (di) is positive:\n\ndi = 5 cm\n\nWe can now use the mirror equation to find the object distance (do):\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n1/10 = 1/do + 1/5\n\nNow, we can solve for do:\n\n1/do = 1/10 - 1/5\n1/do = (1 - 2)/10\n1/do = -1/10\n\ndo = -10 cm\n\nSince the object distance is negative, this means the object is placed in the virtual space (i.e., behind the mirror). So, the focal length of the concave mirror is 10 cm, and the object is placed 10 cm behind the mirror."
