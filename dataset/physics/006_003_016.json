    "message_2": "To calculate the difference in energy between two spectral lines due to the Zeeman effect, we need to consider the energy shift caused by the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the atom. The energy shift is given by the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two spectral lines, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (0.5 T), and Δm_j is the difference in the magnetic quantum number between the two energy levels.\n\nSince the Zeeman effect splits the energy levels into 2J+1 components, where J is the total angular momentum quantum number, the minimum value of Δm_j is 1 (corresponding to adjacent energy levels).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * 1\nΔE = 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nSo, the difference in energy between two spectral lines in an atomic spectrum that correspond to different components of the Zeeman effect for an atom with a magnetic field of 0.5 tesla is approximately 4.637 x 10^-24 J."
