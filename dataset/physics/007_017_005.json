    "message_2": "The cross section for neutron-induced fission of uranium-235 (U-235) is a measure of the probability that a neutron will cause fission when it interacts with a U-235 nucleus. The cross section varies with the energy of the incident neutron and is typically expressed in units of barns (1 barn = 10^-24 cm^2).\n\nFor thermal neutrons, which have energies around 0.025 eV, the fission cross section of U-235 is approximately 580 barns. As the neutron energy increases, the cross section generally decreases. However, there are specific energy ranges called resonances where the cross section increases significantly due to the formation of compound nuclei.\n\nA graphical representation of the cross section as a function of neutron energy can be found in various nuclear data libraries, such as the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library. The graph shows a rapidly decreasing cross section with increasing neutron energy, with several resonance peaks.\n\nThe variation of the U-235 fission cross section with neutron energy is significant in the context of nuclear reactors. In a typical thermal reactor, the majority of fissions are caused by thermal neutrons, which have a high probability of causing fission in U-235 due to the large cross section. This is one of the reasons why U-235 is used as a fuel in thermal reactors.\n\nIn fast reactors, which operate with higher-energy neutrons, the fission cross section of U-235 is smaller, but the fission cross sections of other isotopes, such as plutonium-239 (Pu-239), are larger. This allows fast reactors to utilize a broader range of fissile materials and potentially \"burn\" nuclear waste.\n\nUnderstanding the variation of the fission cross section with neutron energy is essential for designing and operating nuclear reactors, as it directly impacts the reactor's criticality, power output, and fuel utilization."
