It is beyond the scope of a simple answer. However, I can provide you with an overview of the process and the key concepts involved.\n\nThe anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is a measure of the deviation of the electron's magnetic moment from the value predicted by the Dirac equation. This deviation arises due to the interaction of the electron with the surrounding electromagnetic field, which is described by QED.\n\nIn QED, the anomalous magnetic moment is calculated using perturbation theory, which involves expanding the electron's magnetic moment as a power series in the fine-structure constant (α ≈ 1/137). Each term in this series corresponds to a specific order in the perturbation expansion and is represented by a Feynman diagram.\n\nThe first-order term in the expansion, known as the Schwinger term, is relatively simple to calculate and gives a good approximation of the anomalous magnetic moment. However, higher-order terms become increasingly complex and involve a greater number of Feynman diagrams.\n\nTo calculate the anomalous magnetic moment up to the 10th order, you would need to compute the contributions from all Feynman diagrams up to that order. This is a highly challenging task, as the number of diagrams increases rapidly with each order. For example, there are 72 diagrams at the 4th order and over 12,000 diagrams at the 8th order. The 10th order would involve an even larger number of diagrams.\n\nMoreover, each diagram requires the evaluation of complicated integrals, which often need to be computed numerically. This makes the calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment at such high orders a formidable task, even for experienced physicists.\n\nIn practice, most calculations of the anomalous magnetic moment are performed up to a few orders in the perturbation expansion, as this provides a sufficiently accurate result for most purposes. The current experimental value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is known to a precision of about 0.28 parts per billion, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions up to the 8th order in QED.\n\nIn summary, calculating the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron up to the 10th order using quantum field theory is a highly complex task that requires advanced knowledge of QED and perturbation theory. While it is beyond the scope of a simple answer, the key concepts involved include the perturbation expansion, Feynman diagrams, and the evaluation of complicated integrals."
