    "message_2": "The Bohr radius for a hydrogen atom is given by the formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m_e is the electron mass, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nFor the n=3 energy level, the radius is given by:\n\nr = n² * a₀\n\nFirst, let's find the value of a₀ using the given constants:\n\nε₀ = 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm² (vacuum permittivity)\nħ = 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js (reduced Planck constant)\nm_e = 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg (electron mass)\ne = 1.602 x 10^(-19) C (elementary charge)\n\na₀ = (4π(8.854 x 10^(-12))(1.054 x 10^(-34))^2) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2)\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10^(-11) m\n\nNow, let's find the radius for the n=3 energy level:\n\nr = (3^2) * (5.291 x 10^(-11) m)\nr = 9 * (5.291 x 10^(-11) m)\nr ≈ 4.762 x 10^(-10) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius for a hydrogen atom when its electron is in the n=3 energy level is approximately 4.762 x 10^(-10) meters."
