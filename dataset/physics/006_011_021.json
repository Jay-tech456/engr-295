    "message_2": "The Bohr radius is the most probable distance between the proton and the electron in a hydrogen atom when the electron is in its ground state (n=1). It is denoted by a_0 and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na_0 = (4πε_0ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere:\nε_0 = vacuum permittivity = 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²\nħ = reduced Planck constant = 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js\nm_e = electron mass = 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg\ne = elementary charge = 1.602 x 10^(-19) C\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate a_0:\n\na_0 = (4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m² * (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js)²) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg * (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)²)\n\na_0 = (4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) * 1.112 x 10^(-68)) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) * 2.569 x 10^(-38))\n\na_0 = (3.1416 * 9.871 x 10^(-80)) / (2.338 x 10^(-68))\n\na_0 = 3.289 x 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom when its electron is in the ground state is approximately 5.29 x 10^(-11) meters or 52.9 picometers (pm)."
