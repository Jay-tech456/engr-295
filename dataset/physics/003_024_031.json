    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 5 cm = 0.05 m and the current I = 0.5 A, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 0.5 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (2π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.05 m\n\nB = 4π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.26 × 10⁻⁵ T (tesla)."
