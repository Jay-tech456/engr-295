    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 m from the conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small element dl of a conductor carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small element of the conductor, θ is the angle between the current element and the line joining the element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and r is the distance from the conductor to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nFor a straight conductor, the angle θ is 90 degrees, so sinθ = 1. We can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the conductor to find the total magnetic field B at the given point:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nLet's consider the given parameters:\nLength of the conductor, L = 0.5 m\nCurrent, I = 4 A\nDistance from the conductor, r = 0.8 m\nDistance from one end of the conductor, x = 0.2 m\n\nWe can now set up the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * ∫(dl) / (r²) from x = 0.2 m to x = 0.7 m (0.5 m length of the conductor)\n\nTo find the integral, we need to express r in terms of x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nr² = x² + 0.8²\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π) * ∫(dl) / (x² + 0.8²) from x = 0.2 m to x = 0.7 m\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 4 A) / (4 * π) * ∫(dl) / (x² + 0.8²) from x = 0.2 m to x = 0.7 m\n\nB = (16 × 10⁻⁷ Tm) * ∫(dl) / (x² + 0.8²) from x = 0.2 m to x = 0.7 m\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's substitute:\n\nu = x / 0.8\ndu = dx / 0.8\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (16 × 10⁻⁷ Tm) * ∫(0.8 du) / (u² + 1) from u = 0.2/0.8 to u = 0.7/0.8\n\nB = (12.8 × 10⁻⁷ T) * ∫(du) / (u² + 1) from u = 0.25 to u = 0.875\n\nThe integral of du / (u² + 1) is arctan(u). So, we have:\n\nB = (12.8 × 10⁻⁷ T) * [arctan(0.875) - arctan(0.25)]\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nB = (12.8 × 10⁻⁷ T) * [0.738 - 0.245] = (12.8 × 10⁻⁷ T) * 0.493\n\nB ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.8 m from the conductor is approximately 6.31 × 10⁻⁷ T."
