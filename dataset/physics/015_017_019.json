    "message_2": "The most probable frequency range of gravitational waves resulting from a cosmic inflationary epoch is extremely low, typically around 10^(-16) to 10^(-18) Hz. These frequencies are much lower than the ones we can currently detect with ground-based detectors like LIGO or Virgo, which are sensitive to frequencies in the range of 10 Hz to a few kHz.\n\nTo experimentally detect these primordial gravitational waves, we need to rely on indirect methods. One promising approach is to study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is the relic radiation from the early universe. Gravitational waves from the inflationary epoch would have left a unique imprint on the CMB in the form of a specific pattern of polarization, known as \"B-mode\" polarization.\n\nSeveral experiments, such as the BICEP/Keck Array and the Planck satellite, have been designed to measure the CMB's polarization and search for this B-mode signature. So far, no conclusive detection of primordial gravitational waves has been made, but these experiments have provided important constraints on the properties of the inflationary epoch and the possible amplitude of the gravitational waves.\n\nIn the future, more sensitive CMB experiments, such as the Simons Observatory and the proposed CMB-S4 project, will continue to search for the B-mode polarization signal and may eventually provide direct evidence of gravitational waves from the inflationary epoch."
