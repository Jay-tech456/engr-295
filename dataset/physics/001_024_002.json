Additionally, how much work can be extracted per cycle if the heat engine absorbs 100 J of heat from the hot reservoir in each cycle?\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between two thermal baths, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula. The Carnot efficiency is the maximum efficiency any heat engine can achieve when operating between two thermal reservoirs at temperatures T_hot and T_cold.\n\nCarnot efficiency (η_carnot) = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nGiven the temperatures of the thermal baths, we can plug in the values:\n\nT_hot = 500 K\nT_cold = 300 K\n\nη_carnot = 1 - (300 K / 500 K) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nThe maximum efficiency of the heat engine is 0.4, or 40% in terms of the Carnot efficiency.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much work can be extracted per cycle if the heat engine absorbs 100 J of heat from the hot reservoir in each cycle. We can use the formula:\n\nWork (W) = Efficiency × Heat absorbed from the hot reservoir (Q_hot)\n\nW = η_carnot × Q_hot\n\nGiven that the heat engine absorbs 100 J of heat from the hot reservoir in each cycle:\n\nW = 0.4 × 100 J = 40 J\n\nSo, the heat engine can extract 40 J of work per cycle when it absorbs 100 J of heat from the hot reservoir in each cycle."
