    "message_2": "The efficiency of a typical nuclear power plant in converting the energy released by nuclear fission into electrical energy is around 30-35%. This efficiency is determined by the thermodynamic limitations of the heat engine (usually a steam turbine) used to convert the heat generated by nuclear fission into mechanical work, which is then converted into electrical energy by a generator.\n\nFossil fuel-based power plants, such as coal and natural gas plants, have similar thermodynamic limitations. The efficiency of coal-fired power plants ranges from 32-42%, while natural gas power plants have a slightly higher efficiency, ranging from 40-60%. The efficiency of these plants depends on factors such as the type of fuel used, the technology employed, and the age of the plant.\n\nIn summary, the efficiency of a typical nuclear power plant is comparable to that of fossil fuel-based power plants, with both types of plants being limited by the thermodynamic constraints of their heat engines. However, it is important to note that nuclear power plants produce significantly less greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution compared to fossil fuel-based power plants."
