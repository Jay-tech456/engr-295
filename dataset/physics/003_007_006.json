    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the perpendicular bisector of the current-carrying rod, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small length element of the rod, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field at a point on the perpendicular bisector of the rod, we can simplify the problem by considering only half of the rod and then multiplying the result by 2. Let's consider a small current element Idl at a distance x from the center of the rod. The length of the rod is 20 cm, so we will integrate x from -10 cm to 0 cm.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to the point P has a magnitude of 10 cm (the distance from the center of the rod to the point P) and makes an angle θ with the rod such that:\n\ncos(θ) = x / r\n\nNow, the magnetic field dB at point P due to the small current element Idl is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sin(θ)) / r²\n\nSubstituting cos(θ) = x / r, we get:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sqrt(1 - (x² / r²))) / r²\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the length of half the rod (-10 cm to 0 cm) and then multiply the result by 2:\n\nB = 2 * ∫[(-10, 0), (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * sqrt(1 - (x² / r²))) / r²]\n\nLet's plug in the values: μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A, I = 5 A, r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, and convert the limits of integration to meters:\n\nB = 2 * ∫[(-0.1, 0), (4π × 10⁻⁷ / 4π) * (5 * dl * sqrt(1 - (x² / 0.1²))) / 0.1²]\n\nThe 4π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = 2 * ∫[(-0.1, 0), (10⁻⁷ * 5 * dl * sqrt(1 - (x² / 0.1²))) / 0.1²]\n\nB = 10⁻⁶ * ∫[(-0.1, 0), (5 * dl * sqrt(1 - (x² / 0.1²)))]\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nB = 10⁻⁶ * [5 * ∫[(-0.1, 0), sqrt(1 - (x² / 0.1²)) dx]]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = x / 0.1, then x = 0.1u and dx = 0.1 du. The limits of integration will change accordingly: -1 to 0.\n\nB = 10⁻⁶ * [5 * ∫[(-1, 0), sqrt(1 - u²) * 0.1 du]]\n\nB = 10⁻⁷ * [5 * ∫[(-1, 0), sqrt(1 - u²) du]]\n\nThe integral ∫[(-1, 0), sqrt(1 - u²) du] represents half the area of a unit circle, so its value is (1/2)π. Therefore:\n\nB = 10⁻⁷ * [5 * (1/2)π]\n\nB = (5/2) * 10⁻⁷ * π T\n\nB ≈ 7.85 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the rod on its perpendicular bisector is approximately 7.85 × 10⁻⁷ T."
