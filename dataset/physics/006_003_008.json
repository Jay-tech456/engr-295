    "message_2": "To calculate the change in energy of a hydrogen atom transition from n=2 to n=1 when subjected to a magnetic field using the Zeeman effect equation, we need to consider the energy levels of the hydrogen atom in the presence of a magnetic field.\n\nThe Zeeman effect equation is given by:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field, and Δm is the change in the magnetic quantum number (m).\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is a physical constant that represents the magnetic moment of an electron and is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * hbar / (2 * me)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and me is the mass of the electron (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.602 × 10^(-19) C) * (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the magnetic quantum number (m) can have values of -1, 0, and 1. When the hydrogen atom transitions from n=2 to n=1, the possible Δm values are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. However, due to selection rules, only Δm = 0 and Δm = ±1 transitions are allowed.\n\nLet's calculate the change in energy for each allowed Δm value:\n\n1. Δm = 0:\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm\nΔE = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * 0\nΔE = 0 J\n\n2. Δm = ±1:\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm\nΔE = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * 1\nΔE ≈ 4.637 × 10^(-24) J\n\nSo, the change in energy of the hydrogen atom transition from n=2 to n=1 when subjected to a magnetic field of 0.5 Tesla using the Zeeman effect equation is 0 J for Δm = 0 and approximately 4.637 × 10^(-24) J for Δm = ±1."
