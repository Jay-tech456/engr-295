    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole and the size of its event horizon can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating (spherically symmetric) black hole.\n\nThe formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere:\n- r_s is the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon)\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nThis formula is derived from the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations of general relativity, which describe the spacetime geometry around a spherically symmetric mass. The Schwarzschild solution is a simplified model that assumes the black hole is not rotating and has no electric charge. For a rotating black hole, the event horizon size can be calculated using the Kerr metric, which is a more complex solution to the Einstein field equations.\n\nIn summary, the size of a black hole's event horizon is directly proportional to its mass, as described by the Schwarzschild radius formula. The larger the mass of the black hole, the larger the event horizon size."
