    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the adiabatic process equation and the work done formula. For an adiabatic process, the equation is:\n\nPV^γ = constant\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic index, which is the ratio of the specific heat capacities (Cp/Cv).\n\nFirst, we need to find the adiabatic index (γ) for the gas. We are given the specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) as 1.25 J/(g*K). For an ideal diatomic gas, the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is:\n\nCp = Cv + R\n\nwhere R is the gas constant. For a diatomic gas, R = 8.314 J/(mol*K). However, we need to convert R to J/(g*K) to match the given specific heat capacity. To do this, we'll divide R by the molar mass of a diatomic gas (approximately 28.97 g/mol for air):\n\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) / 28.97 g/mol ≈ 0.287 J/(g*K)\n\nNow we can find Cp:\n\nCp = Cv + R = 1.25 J/(g*K) + 0.287 J/(g*K) ≈ 1.537 J/(g*K)\n\nNow we can find the adiabatic index (γ):\n\nγ = Cp / Cv = 1.537 / 1.25 ≈ 1.23\n\nNow we can use the adiabatic process equation to find the final pressure (P2) after the compression:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nwhere P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume. We are given P1 = 2.0 atm, V1 = 4.0 m³, and V2 = 2.0 m³. We can solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ = 2.0 atm * (4.0 m³ / 2.0 m³)^1.23 ≈ 3.46 atm\n\nNow we can find the work done on the gas during the adiabatic compression. The formula for work done in an adiabatic process is:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nW = (2.0 atm * 4.0 m³ - 3.46 atm * 2.0 m³) / (1.23 - 1)\n\nTo convert the pressure from atm to Pa, we'll multiply by 101325 Pa/atm:\n\nW = ((2.0 * 101325 Pa) * 4.0 m³ - (3.46 * 101325 Pa) * 2.0 m³) / (1.23 - 1) ≈ 271,860 J\n\nSo, the adiabatic work done on the gas during this process is approximately 271,860 J."
