    "message_1": "What is the half-life of a certain radioactive isotope if it decays to 1/8 of its original amount after 24 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the half-life formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the substance at time t, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time, and T is the half-life.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the substance decays to 1/8 of its original amount after 24 years. So, N(t) = N0/8 and t = 24 years. We want to find the half-life T.\n\nN0/8 = N0 * (1/2)^(24/T)\n\nDivide both sides by N0:\n\n1/8 = (1/2)^(24/T)\n\nNow, take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(1/8) = log((1/2)^(24/T))\n\nUsing the logarithm property log(a^b) = b * log(a):\n\nlog(1/8) = (24/T) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by log(1/2):\n\nT = 24 / (log(1/8) / log(1/2))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nT â‰ˆ 8 years\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive isotope is approximately 8 years."
