Specifically, design a mathematical procedure that can be applied to determine the cosmic string and monopole solutions in such a system.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the topological defects in a quantum field theory model with spontaneous symmetry breaking and a non-Abelian symmetry group, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the symmetry group G and its vacuum manifold: First, determine the symmetry group G of the system and the vacuum manifold M, which is the set of all vacuum states. The vacuum manifold is given by the quotient space M = G/H, where H is the unbroken subgroup of G after spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n2. Determine the homotopy groups: Calculate the relevant homotopy groups of the vacuum manifold M. For cosmic strings, we are interested in the first homotopy group π1(M), while for monopoles, we need the second homotopy group π2(M).\n\n3. Identify the topological defects: Non-trivial elements in the homotopy groups correspond to topological defects. For cosmic strings, non-trivial elements in π1(M) represent string-like defects, while for monopoles, non-trivial elements in π2(M) represent point-like defects.\n\n4. Construct the field configurations: For each topological defect, construct the corresponding field configuration that minimizes the energy functional. This can be done by solving the classical field equations with appropriate boundary conditions that encode the topological properties of the defects.\n\n5. Calculate the energy and other physical properties: Once the field configurations are obtained, calculate the energy and other physical properties of the topological defects, such as their tension (for cosmic strings) or magnetic charge (for monopoles).\n\nHere's a general outline of the procedure:\n\n1. Start with a non-Abelian gauge theory with a scalar field in the adjoint representation. The Lagrangian density should include the gauge field, scalar field, and their interactions.\n\n2. Identify the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar field that minimizes the potential energy. This VEV will break the gauge symmetry spontaneously.\n\n3. Determine the unbroken subgroup H of the original symmetry group G. The vacuum manifold M is given by the quotient space M = G/H.\n\n4. Calculate the homotopy groups π1(M) and π2(M) to identify the possible topological defects (cosmic strings and monopoles, respectively).\n\n5. For each topological defect, construct the corresponding field configuration by solving the classical field equations with appropriate boundary conditions.\n\n6. Calculate the energy and other physical properties of the topological defects using the obtained field configurations.\n\nBy following this procedure, one can determine the cosmic string and monopole solutions in a quantum field theory model with spontaneous symmetry breaking and a non-Abelian symmetry group."
