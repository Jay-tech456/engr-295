    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) of the copper, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT * ln(T2/T1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the copper, c is the specific heat capacity of copper, ΔT is the change in temperature, T1 is the initial temperature, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 200 g\nc = 0.385 J/g°C\nT1 = 25°C\nT2 = 100°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C\nΔT = 75°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (200 g)(0.385 J/g°C)(75°C) * ln(100°C/25°C)\nΔS = (200)(0.385)(75) * ln(4)\nΔS = 5775 J/°C * ln(4)\nΔS ≈ 5775 J/°C * 1.386\nΔS ≈ 8005.65 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the copper is approximately 8005.65 J/K."
