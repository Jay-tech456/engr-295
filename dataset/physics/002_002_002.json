    "message_2": "We can start by finding the theoretical maximum efficiency of the heat engine using the Carnot efficiency formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (Tc/Th)\nwhere Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir (300 K) and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir (600 K).\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300/600) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nNow, we know that the actual efficiency of the heat engine is 40%. We can use the efficiency formula to find the amount of heat supplied to the engine from the hot reservoir (Qh):\n\nEfficiency = (Qh - Qc) / Qh\nwhere Qc is the heat rejected to the cold reservoir (10,000 J).\n\n0.4 = (Qh - 10,000) / Qh\n\nTo solve for Qh, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n0.4 * Qh = Qh - 10,000\n0.6 * Qh = 10,000\nQh = 10,000 / 0.6\nQh = 16,666.67 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat supplied to the engine from the hot reservoir is approximately 16,666.67 J."
