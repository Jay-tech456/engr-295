    "message_1": "A sphere of radius 10 cm has a current of 5 A flowing uniformly throughout its volume. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 15 cm from the center of the sphere?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed throughout the sphere, we can consider a small volume element dV within the sphere, carrying a small current dI. The volume of the sphere is V = (4/3)πR³, where R = 10 cm = 0.1 m. The total current I = 5 A is distributed uniformly in this volume, so the current density J is given by:\n\nJ = I / V = 5 / ((4/3)π(0.1)³) = 5 / (4π/3 × 10⁻³) = 375 / π A/m³\n\nNow, consider a small volume element dV at a distance r from the center of the sphere and at a distance R' (R' = 15 cm = 0.15 m) from the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field. The small current dI in this volume element is given by:\n\ndI = J * dV\n\nThe magnetic field dB at the point due to this small current dI is given by the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed, the direction of the magnetic field at the point due to the small volume element dV will be along the line connecting the center of the sphere to the point. Therefore, we can integrate the magnetic field over the entire volume of the sphere to find the total magnetic field at the point:\n\nB = ∫∫∫ dB\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J * dV * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the sphere is symmetric, the magnetic field at a point outside the sphere will also be symmetric, and its magnitude will be the same in all directions. Therefore, we can simplify the integral by considering only the radial component of the magnetic field:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J * dV * dl * r) / r³\n\nNow, let's switch to spherical coordinates, where r is the radial distance from the center of the sphere, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle. The volume element in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\ndV = r² * sin(θ) * dr * dθ * dφ\n\nThe distance between the small volume element dV and the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field is given by the law of cosines:\n\nR'² = r² + R² - 2rRcos(θ)\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to r, we get:\n\n2R' * dR' = 2r * dr - 2R * cos(θ) * dr\n\nSince dR' = 0 (the point is fixed), we have:\n\ndl = dr - R * cos(θ) * dr / r\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for dl into the integral for the radial component of the magnetic field:\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫∫∫ (J * r² * sin(θ) * dr * dθ * dφ * (dr - R * cos(θ) * dr / r) * r) / r³\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * J * ∫₀^(2π) dφ * ∫₀^π sin(θ) * dθ * ∫₀^R r * (1 - R * cos(θ) / r) * dr\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * J * 2π * [(-cos(θ))|₀^π] * [(1/2)r² - (1/3)R * cos(θ) * r²]|₀^R\n\nB_radial = (μ₀ / 4π) * J * 2π * 2 * [(1/2)R² - (1/3)R²]\n\nB_radial = μ₀ * J * (1/3) * R²\n\nSubstituting the values of μ₀, J, and R, we get:\n\nB_radial = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (375 / π A/m³) * (1/3) * (0.1 m)²\n\nB_radial ≈ 5 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 15 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 5 × 10⁻⁶ T, and its direction is radially outward from the center of the sphere."
