    "message_1": "A beam of light with a wavelength of 600 nm travels towards a barrier with two narrow slits that are 0.2 mm apart. The distance between the barrier and a screen behind it is 1 m. If the speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/s, calculate the distance between the first maximum and the third maximum of the interference pattern produced on the screen.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the interference pattern produced by a double-slit experiment:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\ny = distance between the m-th maximum and the central maximum on the screen\nm = order of the maximum (1 for the first maximum, 2 for the second maximum, etc.)\nλ = wavelength of the light\nL = distance between the barrier and the screen\nd = distance between the two slits\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to the appropriate units:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 600 nm = 600 x 10^-9 m\nDistance between slits (d) = 0.2 mm = 0.2 x 10^-3 m\nDistance between barrier and screen (L) = 1 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance between the first maximum (m = 1) and the central maximum:\n\ny1 = (1 * 600 x 10^-9 * 1) / (0.2 x 10^-3)\ny1 = 3 x 10^-6 m\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance between the third maximum (m = 3) and the central maximum:\n\ny3 = (3 * 600 x 10^-9 * 1) / (0.2 x 10^-3)\ny3 = 9 x 10^-6 m\n\nFinally, let's find the distance between the first maximum and the third maximum:\n\ny = y3 - y1\ny = 9 x 10^-6 - 3 x 10^-6\ny = 6 x 10^-6 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first maximum and the third maximum of the interference pattern produced on the screen is 6 x 10^-6 m or 6 µm."
