    "message_2": "To determine the piezoelectric coefficient (d) of a quartz crystal, we need to know the generated electric charge (Q) and the applied force (F). The piezoelectric coefficient is given by the formula:\n\nd = Q / F\n\nHowever, you only provided the compressive force (F = 10 N) applied to the quartz crystal. To calculate the piezoelectric coefficient, we need to know the generated electric charge (Q) as well. \n\nIf you provide the generated electric charge, I can help you calculate the piezoelectric coefficient."
