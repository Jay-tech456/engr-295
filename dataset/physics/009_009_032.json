    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the size and orientation of the image formed by a concave mirror of 10 cm focal length, when an object of 3 cm is placed 5 cm away from it. What is the distance of the image from the mirror? Magnification of the image? Is the image real or virtual? Finally, draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image.",
    "message_2": "To determine the distance of the image from the mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = -10 cm (concave mirror has a negative focal length), u = -5 cm (object is on the left side of the mirror, so the distance is negative)\n\n1/(-10) = 1/(-5) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/(-10) - 1/(-5)\n1/v = -1/10 + 2/10\n1/v = 1/10\n\nv = 10 cm\n\nThe image is formed 10 cm away from the mirror.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nm = -10/(-5)\nm = 2\n\nThe magnification of the image is 2, which means the image is twice the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\n\nTo determine if the image is real or virtual, we can look at the sign of the image distance (v). Since v is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image.\n\nRay diagram:\n1. Draw a concave mirror with the principal axis and focal point (F).\n2. Place the object (A) on the left side of the mirror, 5 cm away from it.\n3. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object (A) to the mirror. After reflecting, this ray will pass through the focal point (F).\n4. Draw another ray from the top of the object (A) to the mirror, passing through the focal point (F). After reflecting, this ray will be parallel to the principal axis.\n5. The reflected rays will appear to diverge from a point on the same side as the object. This point is the location of the virtual image (A').\n6. The image (A') will be upright and twice the size of the object (A), 10 cm away from the mirror.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is 10 cm away from the mirror, has a magnification of 2, is upright, and is virtual."
