    "message_2": "To calculate the scattering angle, we need to use the Mott scattering formula. The Mott scattering cross section (σ) is given by:\n\nσ = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e²)² / (16 * π * ε₀² * E * (1 - cos²θ))\n\nWhere:\nZ₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the incident particle and the target atom, respectively\ne is the elementary charge (1.6E-19 C)\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.85E-12 C²/N·m²)\nE is the kinetic energy of the incident particle\nθ is the scattering angle\n\nFor a helium atom, Z₂ = 2. Since the problem statement does not specify the type of charged particle, we will assume it is a proton (Z₁ = 1). The kinetic energy of the particle is given as 5 keV, which is equivalent to 5E3 * 1.6E-19 J = 8E-16 J.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Mott scattering formula and solve for θ:\n\n8.6E-21 m² = (1 * 2 * (1.6E-19 C)²)² / (16 * π * (8.85E-12 C²/N·m²)² * 8E-16 J * (1 - cos²θ))\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for cos²θ:\n\ncos²θ = 1 - ((1 * 2 * (1.6E-19 C)²)² / (16 * π * (8.85E-12 C²/N·m²)² * 8E-16 J * 8.6E-21 m²))\n\ncos²θ = 1 - ((1 * 2 * (1.6E-19 C)²)² / (16 * π * (8.85E-12 C²/N·m²)² * 8E-16 J * 8.6E-21 m²))\n\ncos²θ ≈ 0.9994\n\nNow, take the square root and find the inverse cosine to get the scattering angle:\n\ncosθ ≈ ±0.9997\nθ ≈ ±acos(0.9997)\n\nθ ≈ ±0.026 radians\n\nThe scattering angle is approximately ±0.026 radians or ±1.49 degrees."
