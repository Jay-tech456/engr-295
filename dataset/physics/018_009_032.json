    "message_2": "The maximum temperature that can be reached by a black hole is determined by its Hawking temperature. Hawking temperature is the temperature at which a black hole emits thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. The formula for Hawking temperature (T_H) is given by:\n\nT_H = (ħc^3) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe physical significance of this temperature is that it represents the black hole's thermal radiation, which causes it to lose mass over time through a process called Hawking radiation. As the black hole loses mass, its temperature increases, and it emits radiation more rapidly. In the final stages of its evaporation, the black hole's temperature can become extremely high.\n\nThe temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. As the mass of the black hole decreases, its temperature increases. The radius of a black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (R_s), is directly proportional to its mass:\n\nR_s = (2GM) / c^2\n\nAs the mass of the black hole decreases, its radius also decreases. This means that smaller black holes have higher temperatures.\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is related to its surface area, which is proportional to the square of its radius. The formula for black hole entropy (S) is given by:\n\nS = (kc^3A) / (4ħG)\n\nwhere A is the surface area of the black hole's event horizon. Since the radius is directly proportional to the mass, the entropy of a black hole is also directly proportional to the square of its mass.\n\nIn summary, the maximum temperature of a black hole is determined by its Hawking temperature, which is inversely proportional to its mass. The physical significance of this temperature is that it represents the black hole's thermal radiation, causing it to lose mass over time. The temperature of a black hole is related to its properties such as mass, radius, and entropy through various formulas and relationships."
