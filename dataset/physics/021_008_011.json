    "message_2": "To determine the expected duration and frequency range of the gravitational waves generated by the merger of two black holes with masses 20 and 30 times that of our sun, we can use some basic principles of general relativity and astrophysics.\n\nFirst, let's find the total mass (M) and reduced mass (μ) of the system:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 20 M_sun + 30 M_sun = 50 M_sun\nμ = (M1 * M2) / M = (20 M_sun * 30 M_sun) / 50 M_sun = 12 M_sun\n\nThe characteristic frequency of the gravitational waves (f) during the inspiral phase can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (8 * π * G * M)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and G is the gravitational constant. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nf ≈ 157 Hz\n\nThe frequency will increase as the black holes get closer and merge. The peak frequency (f_peak) can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf_peak ≈ (c^3) / (6 * π * G * M)\n\nf_peak ≈ 209 Hz\n\nNow, let's estimate the duration of the gravitational waves. The time it takes for the black holes to merge (t_merge) can be approximated using the following formula:\n\nt_merge ≈ (5 / 256) * (c^5) / (G^3 * M^2 * μ)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nt_merge ≈ 0.009 seconds\n\nSo, the expected duration of the gravitational waves generated by the merger of these two black holes is approximately 9 milliseconds, and the frequency range is approximately 157 Hz to 209 Hz. Note that these are rough estimates, and the actual values may vary depending on factors such as the black holes' initial separation, eccentricity, and spin."
