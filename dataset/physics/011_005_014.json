    "message_2": "In a ferromagnetic material, the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility is described by the Curie-Weiss law. The magnetic susceptibility (χ) is inversely proportional to the difference between the temperature (T) and the Curie temperature (Tc). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, which depends on the material's properties.\n\nThe Curie temperature (Tc) is the critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material becomes paramagnetic, losing its spontaneous magnetization. Below the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility increases as the temperature decreases, and the material exhibits stronger ferromagnetic behavior.\n\nWhen an external magnetic field (H) is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility is still governed by the Curie-Weiss law. However, the magnetization (M) of the material will increase due to the alignment of magnetic domains in the direction of the applied field. This can be described by the Langevin function, which relates the magnetization to the applied magnetic field and temperature:\n\nM = M_s * L(μH / kT)\n\nwhere M_s is the saturation magnetization, μ is the magnetic moment, k is the Boltzmann constant, and L is the Langevin function.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between temperature and magnetic susceptibility in a ferromagnetic material is described by the Curie-Weiss law, and it changes with the application of an external magnetic field due to the alignment of magnetic domains, which can be described by the Langevin function."
