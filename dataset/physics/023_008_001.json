    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of successful quantum teleportation, we need to consider the entangled state shared between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob), as well as the operations performed during the teleportation protocol.\n\nLet's assume the shared entangled state between Alice and Bob is the Bell state:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nAnd let the qubit Alice wants to teleport to Bob be:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nThe total state of the system (Alice's qubit and the entangled pair) is:\n\n|Ψ_total⟩ = |ψ⟩ ⊗ |Ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell basis measurement on her qubit and her half of the entangled pair. This projects the state of the system into one of the four Bell states:\n\n1. |Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n2. |Φ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ - |11⟩)\n3. |Ψ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ + |10⟩)\n4. |Ψ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ - |10⟩)\n\nThe probability of each outcome is given by the squared amplitude of the corresponding term in the total state. After Alice's measurement, the state of Bob's qubit will be one of the following:\n\n1. α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n2. α|0⟩ - β|1⟩\n3. α|1⟩ + β|0⟩\n4. α|1⟩ - β|0⟩\n\nAlice sends the result of her measurement (2 classical bits) to Bob. Depending on the received information, Bob performs one of the following operations on his qubit to obtain the original state |ψ⟩:\n\n1. Do nothing (I)\n2. Apply a Z gate (Z)\n3. Apply an X gate (X)\n4. Apply both X and Z gates (XZ)\n\nNow, to calculate the probability of successful quantum teleportation, we need to find the probability of each outcome and the corresponding operation that Bob needs to perform. The probability of each outcome is given by the squared amplitude of the corresponding term in the total state:\n\nP(Φ+) = |⟨Φ+|Ψ_total⟩|^2\nP(Φ-) = |⟨Φ-|Ψ_total⟩|^2\nP(Ψ+) = |⟨Ψ+|Ψ_total⟩|^2\nP(Ψ-) = |⟨Ψ-|Ψ_total⟩|^2\n\nSince quantum teleportation is deterministic, the probability of successful teleportation is 1, provided that Alice and Bob follow the protocol correctly and there are no errors in the quantum channel or the operations performed."
