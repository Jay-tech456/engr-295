    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the denaturation of the protein, we can use the equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆H is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the entropy change.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT(K) = T(°C) + 273.15\nT(K) = 37°C + 273.15\nT(K) = 310.15 K\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the units for ∆S are consistent with the units for ∆H. Since ∆H is given in kJ/mol, we should convert ∆S from J/(mol*K) to kJ/(mol*K):\n\n∆S = 250 J/(mol*K) * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.25 kJ/(mol*K)\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n∆G = 100 kJ/mol - (310.15 K * 0.25 kJ/(mol*K))\n∆G = 100 kJ/mol - 77.5375 kJ/mol\n∆G ≈ 22.46 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the denaturation of the protein at 37°C is approximately 22.46 kJ/mol."
