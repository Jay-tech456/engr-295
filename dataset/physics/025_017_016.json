    "message_2": "To determine the Young's modulus (Y) of a lipid bilayer membrane under mechanical stress, we need to consider both Hooke's Law and the formula for membrane bending stiffness (κ). \n\nHooke's Law states that the force (F) required to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) is proportional to that distance, and can be represented as:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere k is the spring constant.\n\nFor a lipid bilayer membrane, we can consider it as a thin elastic sheet. The membrane bending stiffness (κ) is a measure of the energy required to bend the membrane. The relationship between the force (F) and the bending stiffness (κ) can be represented as:\n\nF = (κ * x) / (h^3)\n\nwhere h is the thickness of the membrane.\n\nNow, let's relate the spring constant (k) to the Young's modulus (Y). The spring constant can be represented as:\n\nk = (Y * A) / L\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the membrane and L is its length.\n\nCombining the equations for Hooke's Law, membrane bending stiffness, and the spring constant, we get:\n\nY * A / L = (κ * x) / (h^3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the Young's modulus (Y):\n\nY = (κ * x * L) / (A * h^3)\n\nTo determine the Young's modulus of a lipid bilayer membrane under mechanical stress, you would need to know the membrane bending stiffness (κ), the displacement (x), the length (L), the cross-sectional area (A), and the thickness (h) of the membrane. With these values, you can plug them into the equation above to calculate the Young's modulus."
