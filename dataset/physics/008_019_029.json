    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs field. It was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. The production and decay of the Higgs boson can be described through several processes.\n\nThere are four main production modes for the Higgs boson at the LHC:\n\n1. Gluon-gluon fusion (ggF): This is the dominant production mode, where two gluons from the colliding protons interact to produce a Higgs boson via a loop of heavy quarks (usually top quarks). The predicted production yield is about 87.5% of the total Higgs boson production cross-section.\n\n2. Vector boson fusion (VBF): In this process, two quarks from the colliding protons emit vector bosons (W or Z), which then fuse to produce a Higgs boson. The predicted production yield is about 7.5% of the total Higgs boson production cross-section.\n\n3. Associated production with a vector boson (VH): This process involves the production of a Higgs boson along with a W or Z boson. The predicted production yield is about 4.5% of the total Higgs boson production cross-section.\n\n4. Associated production with a pair of top quarks (ttH): In this process, a Higgs boson is produced along with a pair of top quarks. The predicted production yield is about 0.5% of the total Higgs boson production cross-section.\n\nThe Higgs boson can decay into various final states, depending on its mass (125 GeV). The main decay modes are:\n\n1. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (H → bb): This is the most probable decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%.\n\n2. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons (H → WW): The branching ratio for this decay mode is about 21%.\n\n3. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons (H → ττ): The branching ratio for this decay mode is about 6.3%.\n\n4. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of Z bosons (H → ZZ): The branching ratio for this decay mode is about 2.6%.\n\n5. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons (H → γγ): This is a rare decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 0.2%.\n\nThe measured results from the LHC experiments (ATLAS and CMS) are consistent with the predicted production yields and decay modes for the Higgs boson. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was primarily based on the observation of its decay into two photons (H → γγ) and its decay into four leptons through intermediate Z bosons (H → ZZ → 4ℓ). Since then, other decay modes have been observed, and the measurements continue to be in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions."
