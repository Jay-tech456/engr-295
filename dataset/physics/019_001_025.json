    "message_2": "In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the scattering amplitude of two electrons interacting through the exchange of a photon can be calculated using Feynman diagrams. To the first non-trivial order of perturbation theory, we consider the lowest order diagram, which is the exchange of a single virtual photon between the two electrons.\n\nThe scattering amplitude, often denoted as M, can be calculated using the Feynman rules for QED:\n\n1. Assign a momentum to each incoming and outgoing electron and photon.\n2. Write down a propagator for each internal photon line.\n3. Write down a vertex factor for each vertex.\n4. Integrate over the internal photon momentum.\n\nFor the electron-electron scattering, the Feynman diagram consists of two vertices and one internal photon line. The vertex factor in QED is given by:\n\n-ig_e * γ^μ\n\nwhere g_e is the electron charge (in natural units), and γ^μ is a 4x4 gamma matrix.\n\nThe photon propagator is given by:\n\n-i * (g^μν / (k^2 + iε))\n\nwhere g^μν is the metric tensor, k^2 is the momentum transfer squared, and iε is a small imaginary part to ensure the correct contour integration.\n\nNow, we can write down the scattering amplitude M:\n\nM = (-ig_e * γ^μ) * (-i * (g^μν / (k^2 + iε))) * (-ig_e * γ^ν)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nM = (g_e^2 * γ^μ * g^μν * γ^ν) / (k^2 + iε)\n\nThis is the scattering amplitude for two electrons interacting through the exchange of a photon in QED to the first non-trivial order of perturbation theory. To obtain the differential cross-section, one would need to square the amplitude, average over initial spins, and sum over final spins, followed by integrating over the final momenta."
