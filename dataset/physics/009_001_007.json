    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven the refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1, the refractive index of glass (n2) is 1.50, and the angle of incidence (θ1) is 45 degrees, we can solve for the angle of refraction (θ2):\n\n1 * sin(45) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071\n\n0.7071 = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.7071 / 1.50\nsin(θ2) = 0.4714\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4714)\nθ2 ≈ 28.1 degrees\n\nThe angle of refraction is approximately 28.1 degrees.\n\nTo find the critical angle, we can use the formula:\n\ncritical angle (θc) = arcsin(n2 / n1)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the denser medium (glass) and n2 is the refractive index of the less dense medium (air).\n\nθc = arcsin(1 / 1.50)\nθc = arcsin(0.6667)\nθc ≈ 41.8 degrees\n\nThe critical angle is approximately 41.8 degrees.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle. In this scenario, the angle of incidence is 45 degrees, which is greater than the critical angle of 41.8 degrees. Therefore, total internal reflection will not occur in this case."
