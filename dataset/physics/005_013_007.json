    "message_2": "To find the energy released in the collision, we first need to find the total energy of the system before and after the collision. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy and momentum of the moving particle before the collision:\n\nThe relativistic momentum is given by:\n\np = mv / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor the moving particle, v = 0.6c, so:\n\np = m(0.6c) / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\np = 0.6mc / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\np = 0.6mc / sqrt(0.64)\np = 0.6mc / 0.8\np = 0.75mc\n\nNow, we can find the energy of the moving particle using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (0.75mc)^2\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (0.5625m^2c^2)\nE^2 = 1.5625m^2c^4\nE = mc^2 * sqrt(1.5625)\n\nThe energy of the particle at rest is simply its rest mass energy:\n\nE_rest = mc^2\n\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the two particles:\n\nE_total_before = E + E_rest\nE_total_before = mc^2 * (sqrt(1.5625) + 1)\n\nNow, let's consider the collision. Since the particles have equal masses and collide head-on, they will come to rest after the collision. The total energy after the collision will be the rest mass energy of the combined mass (2m):\n\nE_total_after = 2(mc^2)\n\nThe energy released in the collision is the difference between the total energy before and after the collision:\n\nE_released = E_total_before - E_total_after\nE_released = mc^2 * (sqrt(1.5625) + 1) - 2(mc^2)\nE_released = mc^2 * (sqrt(1.5625) - 1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of c (the speed of light) to find the energy released:\n\nE_released = m * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * (sqrt(1.5625) - 1)\nE_released â‰ˆ 1.32 * 10^17 * m J\n\nSo, the energy released in the collision is approximately 1.32 * 10^17 times the mass of the particles in joules."
