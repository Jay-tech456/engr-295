    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field due to a straight conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire of length (L) carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nGiven the values in the problem:\n\nI = 2 A (current)\nr = 5 cm = 0.05 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe Amperes (A) cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1π m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we can further simplify the expression:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
