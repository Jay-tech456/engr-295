    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field surrounding the wire, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) at a point due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current flowing through the wire, dL is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nSince we are dealing with a circular wire loop, we can simplify the Biot-Savart Law for this specific case. The magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the loop (10 cm or 0.1 m) and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field (5 cm or 0.05 m).\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.1 m)^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m^2) / ((0.01 m^2 + 0.0025 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 0.01) / (0.0125^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.60 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field surrounding the wire at a distance of 5 cm from its center is approximately 1.60 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
