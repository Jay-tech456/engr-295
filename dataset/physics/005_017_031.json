    "message_1": "A particle moves along the x-axis with a speed of 0.8c relative to an observer. At the position x = 0, t = 0, the particle emits a flash of light towards the positive x-axis. What is the equation describing the trajectory of the light in the observer's reference frame?",
    "message_2": "In the observer's reference frame, the particle is moving along the x-axis with a speed of 0.8c. When the particle emits a flash of light at x = 0 and t = 0, the light will travel at the speed of light, c, in the positive x-axis direction.\n\nThe trajectory of the light in the observer's reference frame can be described by the equation:\n\nx(t) = ct\n\nSince the speed of light, c, is constant, the equation simplifies to:\n\nx(t) = ct\n\nThis equation describes the trajectory of the light in the observer's reference frame as a function of time t."
