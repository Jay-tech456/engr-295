    "message_2": "The current theoretical understanding of the relationship between dark matter and dark energy is that they are two distinct phenomena that play crucial roles in the expansion and evolution of the universe. While they are often mentioned together, they have different properties and effects on the universe.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes and other instruments that detect light. It is believed to account for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation. Dark matter is thought to act as a \"glue\" that holds galaxies together and provides the necessary mass for gravitational attraction to form large-scale structures in the universe.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that is believed to make up about 68% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is thought to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The concept of dark energy was introduced after the discovery in the late 1990s that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, as was previously expected due to the gravitational attraction of matter, but is instead accelerating.\n\nThe evidence for dark energy comes from multiple sources, including:\n\n1. Supernovae observations: By observing Type Ia supernovae, which are considered \"standard candles\" due to their consistent peak brightness, astronomers were able to determine that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This discovery was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations have allowed scientists to determine the composition of the universe, including the presence of dark energy.\n\n3. Baryon acoustic oscillations: These are fluctuations in the density of visible matter that were imprinted in the early universe and can still be observed today. By studying the distribution of galaxies and the patterns of these oscillations, scientists can infer the presence of dark energy.\n\nWhile the exact nature of dark matter and dark energy remains unknown, their effects on the expansion of the universe are well-established. Dark matter provides the gravitational force necessary for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. Understanding the relationship between these two phenomena is an ongoing area of research in cosmology and fundamental physics."
