    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic momentum and energy of the particle, we need to use the following formulas:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p) = m * v / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n2. Relativistic energy (E) = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nMass (m) = 0.2 kg\nVelocity (v) = 0.9 * speed of light (c) = 0.9c\n\nThe speed of light (c) = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, let's calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = m * v / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\np = 0.2 * (0.9c) / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\np = 0.2 * (0.9c) / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\np = 0.2 * (0.9c) / sqrt(0.19)\n\nNow, let's calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\nE = 0.2 * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nE = 0.2 * c^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nE = 0.2 * c^2 / sqrt(0.19)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values of c:\n\np = 0.2 * (0.9 * 3.0 x 10^8) / sqrt(0.19)\np ≈ 0.2 * 2.7 x 10^8 / 0.43589\np ≈ 5.4 x 10^8 / 0.43589\np ≈ 1.238 x 10^9 kg m/s\n\nE = 0.2 * (3.0 x 10^8)^2 / sqrt(0.19)\nE ≈ 0.2 * 9.0 x 10^16 / 0.43589\nE ≈ 1.8 x 10^16 / 0.43589\nE ≈ 4.128 x 10^16 J\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the particle is approximately 1.238 x 10^9 kg m/s, and the relativistic energy is approximately 4.128 x 10^16 J."
