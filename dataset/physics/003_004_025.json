    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current passing through the loop. The formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 0.1 m and the current I = 2 A, we can now calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\nB ≈ (8 * 3.14159 * 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\nB ≈ 1.25664 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 1.25664 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
