    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a non-linear mechanical oscillator that exhibits complex behavior, including chaos. The equation of motion for the Duffing oscillator is given by:\n\nm * d^2x/dt^2 + c * dx/dt + k1 * x + k3 * x^3 = F0 * cos(ω * t)\n\nwhere m is the mass, c is the damping coefficient, k1 and k3 are the linear and cubic stiffness coefficients, F0 is the amplitude of the external force, and ω is the angular frequency of the external force.\n\nIn this problem, we are asked to analyze the chaotic behavior of the Duffing oscillator with a non-linear damping coefficient. Let's assume that the damping coefficient is given by:\n\nc(x) = c0 + c1 * x^2\n\nwhere c0 and c1 are constants. The equation of motion now becomes:\n\nm * d^2x/dt^2 + (c0 + c1 * x^2) * dx/dt + k1 * x + k3 * x^3 = F0 * cos(ω * t)\n\nTo analyze the chaotic behavior of this system, we can use numerical methods to solve the equation of motion for different initial conditions and parameter values. One common approach is to use the Runge-Kutta method to integrate the equation of motion and obtain the time evolution of the system.\n\nBy plotting the phase space trajectories (x, dx/dt) for different initial conditions, we can explore the chaotic behavior of the system. If the trajectories are sensitive to the initial conditions and exhibit a complex, non-periodic structure, the system is considered chaotic.\n\nTo determine the maximum amplitude of oscillations, we can analyze the system's response to the external force. The amplitude of oscillations can be estimated by finding the maximum value of x(t) in the time series obtained from the numerical integration. By varying the parameters of the system (e.g., F0, ω, c0, and c1), we can find the combination that leads to the maximum amplitude of oscillations.\n\nIn summary, the chaotic behavior of a Duffing oscillator with a non-linear damping coefficient can be analyzed using numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to integrate the equation of motion and explore the phase space trajectories. The maximum amplitude of oscillations can be determined by analyzing the system's response to the external force and finding the maximum value of x(t) in the time series."
