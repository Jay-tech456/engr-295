    "message_2": "To determine the minimum initial mass required for a protostar to ignite nuclear fusion and become a star, we need to consider the conditions under which nuclear fusion can occur. The primary process that powers stars is the fusion of hydrogen into helium, which occurs through the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle. For this to happen, the core temperature of the protostar must be high enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between protons.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The protostar is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements.\n2. The protostar is in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning the gravitational force is balanced by the pressure gradient force.\n3. The opacity of the protostar is dominated by the Kramers' opacity law, which states that the opacity is proportional to the density and inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nTo ignite nuclear fusion, the core temperature of the protostar must reach around 10 million Kelvin (10^7 K). This temperature is achieved when the gravitational force compresses the core, raising the pressure and temperature. The minimum mass required for this to happen is known as the \"hydrogen-burning limit.\"\n\nUsing the Virial theorem, which relates the gravitational potential energy and the internal thermal energy of a self-gravitating system, we can estimate the core temperature of the protostar:\n\nT_core ~ (G * M * m_p) / (k * R)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the protostar, m_p is the proton mass, k is the Boltzmann constant, and R is the protostar's radius.\n\nFor a protostar to ignite nuclear fusion, the core temperature must be around 10^7 K. Using the Virial theorem and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we can estimate the minimum mass required for this to happen:\n\nM_min ~ (k * R * T_core) / (G * m_p)\n\nThe radius R can be estimated using the mass-radius relation for low-mass stars, which states that R is proportional to M^0.8:\n\nR ~ R_sun * (M / M_sun)^0.8\n\nwhere R_sun and M_sun are the solar radius and mass, respectively.\n\nSubstituting this relation into the previous equation, we get:\n\nM_min ~ (k * R_sun * T_core) / (G * m_p * M_sun^0.8)\n\nUsing the known values for the constants and solar properties, we can estimate the minimum mass required for a protostar to ignite nuclear fusion:\n\nM_min ~ (1.38 * 10^-23 J/K * 6.96 * 10^8 m * 10^7 K) / (6.67 * 10^-11 N m^2/kg^2 * 1.67 * 10^-27 kg * (1.989 * 10^30 kg)^0.8)\n\nM_min ~ 0.08 * M_sun\n\nSo, the minimum initial mass required for a protostar to ignite nuclear fusion and become a star through hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately 8% of the solar mass, or 0.08 times the mass of the Sun."
