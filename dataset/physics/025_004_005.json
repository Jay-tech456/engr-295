Given that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction is -30 kJ/mol and the equilibrium constant (K_eq) for the reaction is 4.5. (Assume that the reaction is at standard conditions.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nΔG° = standard free energy change (-30 kJ/mol)\nR = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = temperature (25°C = 298 K)\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nSince the reaction is at standard conditions, the concentrations of the reactants and products are equal to their standard states (1 M). Therefore, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K_eq).\n\nQ = K_eq = 4.5\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = -30,000 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(298 K) ln(4.5)\n\nΔG ≈ -30,000 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K)(298 K)(1.504)\n\nΔG ≈ -30,000 J/mol + 3,732 J/mol\n\nΔG ≈ -26,268 J/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of converting substrate A to product B at a temperature of 25°C is approximately -26,268 J/mol."
