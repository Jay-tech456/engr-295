    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the gauge/gravity duality, is a powerful tool for studying strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFTs) by relating them to weakly interacting gravitational theories in higher dimensions. In particular, it relates a conformal field theory (CFT) in d dimensions to a gravitational theory in (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.\n\nTo calculate the holographic dualities for a strongly interacting QFT with a non-zero temperature, we can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify the QFT and its dual gravitational theory: First, we need to identify the strongly interacting QFT we want to study and its corresponding dual gravitational theory. For example, the prototypical example of AdS/CFT correspondence is the duality between N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in 4 dimensions and Type IIB supergravity on AdS_5 x S^5.\n\n2. Introduce a non-zero temperature: To study the QFT at a non-zero temperature, we need to introduce a black hole in the dual gravitational theory. The temperature of the QFT is related to the Hawking temperature of the black hole. For example, in the case of AdS_5 x S^5, we can consider a Schwarzschild-AdS_5 black hole.\n\n3. Calculate the observables: Next, we need to calculate the observables of interest in the QFT, such as correlation functions, free energy, or entropy. This can be done by studying the corresponding quantities in the dual gravitational theory. For example, to compute the two-point correlation function of operators in the QFT, we can study the propagation of fields in the gravitational theory between the boundary of AdS space and the black hole horizon.\n\n4. Use the holographic dictionary: The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a dictionary that relates quantities in the QFT to those in the gravitational theory. For example, the partition function of the QFT is related to the on-shell action of the gravitational theory, and the expectation value of an operator in the QFT is related to the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding field in the gravitational theory. By using this dictionary, we can translate the results obtained in the gravitational theory to the QFT.\n\n5. Analyze the results: Finally, we can analyze the results obtained for the strongly interacting QFT at non-zero temperature. This can provide insights into the behavior of the QFT, such as phase transitions, transport properties, or the equation of state.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the holographic dualities for a strongly interacting QFT with a non-zero temperature using AdS/CFT correspondence, we need to identify the QFT and its dual gravitational theory, introduce a non-zero temperature by considering a black hole in the gravitational theory, calculate the observables of interest, use the holographic dictionary to translate the results, and analyze the results to gain insights into the QFT."
