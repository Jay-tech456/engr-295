    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between two reservoirs using the Carnot cycle, we can use the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the colder reservoir and T_hot is the temperature of the hotter reservoir. In this case, T_cold = 300 K and T_hot = 500 K.\n\nEfficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K)\nEfficiency = 1 - 0.6\nEfficiency = 0.4\n\nThe maximum efficiency of the heat engine operating between the two reservoirs using the Carnot cycle is 40%."
