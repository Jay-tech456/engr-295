    "message_1": "A polarizer is placed in front of a light source that emits unpolarized light. Another polarizer with an angle of 60 degrees to the first one is placed after the first polarizer. If the intensity of the light passing through the first polarizer is 5 W/m², what will be the intensity of the light passing through the second polarizer? Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through two polarizers is given by the equation:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the intensity of the light after passing through the second polarizer, I₀ is the intensity of the light after passing through the first polarizer, and θ is the angle between the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, I₀ = 5 W/m² and θ = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can use Malus' Law to find the intensity of the light passing through the second polarizer:\n\nI = 5 * cos²(π / 3)\nI = 5 * (1/2)²\nI = 5 * (1/4)\nI = 5/4 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light passing through the second polarizer is 1.25 W/m²."
