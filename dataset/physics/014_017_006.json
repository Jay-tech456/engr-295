    "message_2": "The maximum energy of cosmic rays that can cause single event upsets (SEUs) in a modern computer chip is around 200 MeV (million electron volts). Cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originating from outer space, can interact with the semiconductor material in computer chips, causing temporary or permanent malfunctions.\n\nTo protect electronics from such effects, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Shielding: Encasing sensitive electronic components in shielding materials, such as metal or plastic, can help absorb or deflect incoming cosmic rays. However, this method has limitations, as very high-energy cosmic rays can still penetrate the shielding.\n\n2. Error-correcting codes: Implementing error-correcting codes in the memory and data transmission systems can help detect and correct errors caused by SEUs. This method is widely used in space missions and other critical applications.\n\n3. Redundancy: Designing electronic systems with redundant components can help ensure that if one component is affected by an SEU, the system can still function correctly. This can be achieved by using multiple processors, memory modules, or other components that perform the same function and can take over if one fails.\n\n4. Hardened components: Using radiation-hardened components, which are specifically designed to be more resistant to radiation-induced errors, can help reduce the risk of SEUs. These components are often used in aerospace and military applications.\n\n5. System monitoring and recovery: Continuously monitoring the performance of electronic systems and implementing recovery mechanisms can help detect and correct errors caused by SEUs. This can include resetting affected components or switching to backup systems when an error is detected.\n\nBy employing these strategies, it is possible to mitigate the risk of SEUs in modern computer chips and protect electronics from the effects of cosmic rays."
