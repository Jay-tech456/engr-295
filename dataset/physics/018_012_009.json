    "message_2": "The minimum energy threshold for detecting gamma-ray photons using Cherenkov telescopes in high-energy gamma-ray astronomy is typically around 20-30 GeV (giga-electron volts). This threshold is determined by the sensitivity of the telescope and the atmospheric conditions, as Cherenkov telescopes detect the Cherenkov radiation produced by gamma-ray photons interacting with the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nCurrent technology, such as the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC), has allowed us to reach this energy threshold quite effectively. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), which is currently under construction, aims to further improve the sensitivity and lower the energy threshold to around 20 GeV or even lower.\n\nIn summary, the minimum energy threshold for detecting gamma-ray photons using Cherenkov telescopes is around 20-30 GeV, and current technology is already capable of reaching this threshold. Future developments like the CTA will likely push the limits even further, allowing for more precise observations in high-energy gamma-ray astronomy."
