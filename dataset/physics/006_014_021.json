    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of an electron in the first excited state of a hydrogen atom, we can use the Einstein A coefficient, which describes the probability of spontaneous emission. The formula for the Einstein A coefficient is:\n\nA = (64 * π^4 * e^2 * f^3) / (3 * h * c^3)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and f is the frequency of the emitted photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference (10.2 eV) to frequency using the formula:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy difference and h is the Planck's constant.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for f:\n\nf = E / h\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nE = 10.2 eV = 10.2 * 1.6 × 10^(-19) J = 1.632 × 10^(-18) J\nh = 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js\n\nf = (1.632 × 10^(-18) J) / (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) = 2.462 × 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the Einstein A coefficient:\n\ne = 1.602 × 10^(-19) C\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nA = (64 * π^4 * (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)^2 * (2.462 × 10^15 Hz)^3) / (3 * 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^3)\nA ≈ 4.577 × 10^8 s^(-1)\n\nThe lifetime τ of the electron in the first excited state is the inverse of the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A\n\nτ = 1 / (4.577 × 10^8 s^(-1)) ≈ 2.183 × 10^(-9) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of an electron in the first excited state of a hydrogen atom is approximately 2.183 nanoseconds."
