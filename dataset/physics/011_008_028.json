    "message_2": "YBCO, or Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide, is a high-temperature superconductor with the general chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7-x. The critical temperature (Tc) of YBCO is the temperature below which it exhibits superconductivity, meaning it has zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism.\n\nThe critical temperature of YBCO is typically around 92 K (-181 °C or -294 °F) under optimal doping conditions. However, the Tc can change with different doping levels, which involves substituting or adding elements to the YBCO structure. Doping can either increase or decrease the critical temperature, depending on the type and concentration of dopants.\n\nFor example, when YBCO is doped with elements like Praseodymium (Pr) or Neodymium (Nd), the critical temperature tends to decrease. On the other hand, doping with elements like Calcium (Ca) or Strontium (Sr) can increase the critical temperature. The exact change in Tc depends on the specific dopant and its concentration.\n\nIn summary, the critical temperature of YBCO is around 92 K, and it can change with different doping levels. The effect of doping on Tc depends on the type and concentration of dopants used."
