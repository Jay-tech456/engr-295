    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a focal length of 10cm. An object of height 2cm is placed 30cm away from the mirror. Determine the image distance, magnification and height of the image formed.",
    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(3 + 1v) / 30 = 1/10\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n3 + 1v = 10 * 3\n1v = 30 - 3\nv = 27 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 27 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (m) using the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nm = -27/30\nm = -0.9\n\nThe magnification is -0.9, which means the image is inverted and 0.9 times the size of the object.\n\nFinally, we can find the height of the image (h') using the magnification:\n\nh' = m * h\n\nwhere h is the height of the object.\n\nh' = -0.9 * 2\nh' = -1.8 cm\n\nThe height of the image is -1.8 cm, which indicates that the image is inverted and 1.8 cm tall.\n\nIn summary, the image distance is 27 cm, the magnification is -0.9, and the height of the image is -1.8 cm."
