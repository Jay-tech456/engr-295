    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific physics problem for a student to solve:\n\nA certain substance has a mass of 100g and undergoes a phase change from a solid to a liquid at a temperature of 0Â°C. During this phase change, the substance absorbs 3000 J of heat energy. Using this information, calculate the latent heat of fusion of the substance in J/g.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the latent heat of fusion, we can use the following formula:\n\nQ = mL\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed (in Joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), and L is the latent heat of fusion (in J/g).\n\nWe are given the values of Q (3000 J) and m (100 g), and we need to find the value of L. Rearranging the formula to solve for L, we get:\n\nL = Q / m\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nL = 3000 J / 100 g\n\nL = 30 J/g\n\nSo, the latent heat of fusion of the substance is 30 J/g."
