    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories: a gravity theory in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and a conformal field theory (CFT) on the boundary of that space. This correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997 and has since become a central topic in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of string theory.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence relates to the holographic principle, which posits that the information contained within a certain volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary of that space, much like a hologram. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic principle suggests that a gravitational theory in a higher-dimensional AdS space can be described by a CFT on its lower-dimensional boundary, without any loss of information.\n\nThis correspondence has been used to make predictions about strongly coupled quantum field theories, which are difficult to study using traditional methods due to their non-perturbative nature. One example of such a prediction is the calculation of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s) for a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter believed to exist in the early universe and in high-energy particle collisions.\n\nUsing the AdS/CFT correspondence, physicists were able to compute the value of η/s for a certain class of strongly coupled quantum field theories, finding that it has a universal lower bound of ħ/(4πkB), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant. This result has been confirmed by experimental measurements in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), providing strong evidence for the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence and its applicability to real-world physical systems."
