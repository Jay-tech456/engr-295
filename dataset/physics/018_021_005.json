    "message_2": "In the context of lepton flavor violation, the decay of a tau lepton into a muon and a photon is a rare process. The probability of such a decay occurring can be quantified by the branching ratio, which is the fraction of tau decays that result in this specific final state.\n\nExperimental measurements have set upper limits on the branching ratio for this decay. The most recent result from the Belle experiment has set an upper limit of 3.3 x 10^-8 at a 90% confidence level for the branching ratio of tau lepton decaying into a muon and a photon (τ → μγ).\n\nIt is important to note that this value is an upper limit, meaning that the actual branching ratio could be lower. The current theoretical predictions for this decay in the context of the Standard Model of particle physics are much smaller, making it an extremely rare process. However, if new physics beyond the Standard Model is discovered, the branching ratio could potentially be larger.\n\nIn summary, based on current experimental measurements and theoretical predictions, the probability of finding a tau lepton decaying into a muon and a photon is very low, with an upper limit of about 3.3 x 10^-8."
