    "message_2": "The decay rate of a charged pion (π±) decaying into a muon (μ±) and a neutrino (νμ or ν̅μ) through the weak interaction in quantum field theory can be described by the Fermi's Golden Rule. The decay process is represented as:\n\nπ± → μ± + νμ(ν̅μ)\n\nThe decay rate (Γ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΓ = (G_F^2 * m_π^5) / (192 * π^3 * ℏ^7) * f(m_μ / m_π) * (1 + ΔR)\n\nwhere:\n- G_F is the Fermi coupling constant, approximately 1.166 x 10^(-5) GeV^(-2)\n- m_π is the mass of the charged pion, approximately 139.6 MeV/c^2\n- m_μ is the mass of the muon, approximately 105.7 MeV/c^2\n- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10^(-16) eV*s\n- f(x) is a phase space factor that depends on the ratio of muon mass to pion mass\n- ΔR is a radiative correction term that accounts for the effects of virtual photons in the decay process\n\nThe phase space factor, f(x), can be calculated as:\n\nf(x) = 1 - 8x^2 + 8x^6 - x^8 - 12x^4 * ln(x)\n\nThe radiative correction term, ΔR, is typically a small value and can be approximated as 0.016.\n\nBy plugging in the values and calculating, the decay rate (Γ) for the charged pion decay is approximately 2.53 x 10^7 s^(-1). The mean lifetime (τ) of the charged pion can be found by taking the inverse of the decay rate:\n\nτ = 1/Γ ≈ 26.0 x 10^(-9) s\n\nThe factors that influence the decay rate of this process include the masses of the particles involved (pion and muon), the Fermi coupling constant, and the radiative correction term. Changes in these factors would affect the decay rate and the mean lifetime of the charged pion."
