    "message_2": "The current experimental measurements of the masses of the W and Z bosons are as follows:\n\n1. W boson mass (mW): The most precise measurement of the W boson mass comes from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab. The combined result is mW = 80.379 ± 0.012 GeV/c².\n\n2. Z boson mass (mZ): The most precise measurement of the Z boson mass comes from the LEP experiments at CERN. The combined result is mZ = 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV/c².\n\nThese experimental measurements are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions from the Standard Model of particle physics. The masses of the W and Z bosons are related to the electroweak symmetry breaking, which is a crucial aspect of the Standard Model. The Higgs mechanism, responsible for this symmetry breaking, also predicts the existence of the Higgs boson, which was discovered in 2012 at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nThe agreement between the experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the W and Z boson masses provides strong support for the Standard Model. However, it is important to note that the Standard Model is not a complete theory, as it does not include gravity or explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Further research and experimentation are needed to address these open questions in fundamental physics."
