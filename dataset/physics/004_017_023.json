    "message_2": "The deflection angle of a light ray passing close to a massive object due to gravitational lensing in general relativity can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = 4 * G * M / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the massive object (in kg)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the distance of closest approach (also known as the impact parameter) between the light ray and the massive object (in meters)\n\nThis formula is derived from the general theory of relativity, which predicts that the presence of a massive object will curve spacetime, causing the path of a light ray to bend as it passes near the object. The deflection angle is the angle between the incoming and outgoing light rays, as observed from a point far away from the massive object."
