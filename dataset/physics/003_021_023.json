    "message_1": "A transformer consists of 200 turns in its primary coil and 400 turns in its secondary coil. If the current in the primary coil is 5 A and a frequency of 50 Hz is applied, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the transformer at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by the transformer at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current in the primary coil.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since we are not given the length of the coil, we will assume that the primary and secondary coils have the same length. Therefore, the total number of turns in the transformer is 200 (primary) + 400 (secondary) = 600 turns.\n\nLet's assume the length of the coil is L. Then, n = 600 turns / L.\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (600 turns / L) * 5 A\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm/turn) * (5 A)\n\nB = 60π × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil. To do this, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a solenoid at a distance r from its center:\n\nB_r = (μ₀ * n * I * r) / (2 * L)\n\nwhere B_r is the magnetic field at distance r, and r = 0.1 m (10 cm).\n\nB_r = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (600 turns / L) * 5 A * 0.1 m / (2 * L)\n\nB_r = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm/turn) * (5 A) * 0.1 m / 2\n\nB_r = 3π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the transformer at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil is approximately 3π × 10^(-6) T or 9.42 × 10^(-6) T."
