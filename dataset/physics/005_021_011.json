    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic Doppler shift, we can use the formula:\n\nobserved_wavelength = emitted_wavelength * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere\nobserved_wavelength = 475 nm (measured by the observer on Earth)\nemitted_wavelength = 500 nm (emitted from the spacecraft)\nv = 0.8c (80% the speed of light)\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\n\nFirst, let's convert the wavelengths from nanometers to meters:\n\nobserved_wavelength = 475 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 475 x 10^-9 m\nemitted_wavelength = 500 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 500 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula:\n\n475 x 10^-9 = 500 x 10^-9 * sqrt((1 + 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))\n\nDivide both sides by 500 x 10^-9:\n\n0.95 = sqrt((1.8) / (0.2))\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n0.95^2 = (1.8) / (0.2)\n\n0.9025 = 9\n\nNow, let's solve for the Doppler shift:\n\nDoppler_shift = observed_wavelength / emitted_wavelength\n\nDoppler_shift = 0.95\n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift experienced by the photon is 0.95, meaning the observed wavelength is 95% of the emitted wavelength."
