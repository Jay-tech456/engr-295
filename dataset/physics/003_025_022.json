    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 2 A, we can use the formula for the magnetic field strength around a straight wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, I = 2 A and r = 5 cm = 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe Amperes (A) cancel out, and we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1π m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we can further simplify the expression:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the straight wire carrying a current of 2 A is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla (T). Note that the resistance of the wire is not needed to solve this problem."
