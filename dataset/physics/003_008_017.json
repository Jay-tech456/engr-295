The loop is centered at a distance of $10\\text{ cm}$ from the wire. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current in the wire.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current in the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart law. For a long straight wire, the magnetic field at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 2 A, and the distance r is 10 cm (0.1 m). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10⁻⁷ Tm * 2) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = (8 × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the current in the wire is 8 × 10⁻⁶ T (8 microteslas)."
