    "message_2": "To find the Curie temperature (Tc) of the ferromagnetic material, we can use the Curie-Weiss law, which relates the magnetization (M) of a ferromagnetic material to its temperature (T) and the Curie temperature (Tc):\n\nM = M0 * (1 - T/Tc)\n\nwhere M0 is the saturation magnetization at 0 K, and M is the magnetization at temperature T.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the magnetization decreases by 50% from its saturation value when the material is heated to 400 K. This means that:\n\nM = 0.5 * M0\n\nWe are also given that the temperature at this point is T = 400 K. We can now plug these values into the Curie-Weiss law equation and solve for Tc:\n\n0.5 * M0 = M0 * (1 - 400/Tc)\n\nDividing both sides by M0, we get:\n\n0.5 = 1 - 400/Tc\n\nNow, we can solve for Tc:\n\n0.5 = 400/Tc\nTc = 400/0.5\nTc = 800 K\n\nSo, the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material is 800 K."
