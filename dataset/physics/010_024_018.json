    "message_2": "A supernova Type II explosion occurs when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and undergoes core collapse due to the force of gravity. The minimum mass required for a main sequence star to undergo this process is typically around 8 solar masses (M☉), where 1 M☉ is the mass of our Sun (1.989 x 10^30 kg). This is because stars with lower masses do not have the necessary core temperature and pressure to fuse elements heavier than helium, and they will eventually evolve into white dwarfs without undergoing core collapse.\n\nTo provide a detailed calculation, we need to consider the conditions in the star's core at the moment of core collapse. The core collapse is triggered when the star's core, composed mainly of iron, reaches a critical mass known as the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 M☉). At this point, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the core against gravitational collapse.\n\nThe pressure (P) in the core can be estimated using the equation of state for a non-relativistic, degenerate electron gas:\n\nP ≈ K * (ρ/m_e)^(5/3)\n\nwhere K is a constant, ρ is the core density, and m_e is the electron mass.\n\nThe temperature (T) in the core can be estimated using the virial theorem, which relates the gravitational potential energy (U) and the internal kinetic energy (K) of the core:\n\n2K + U = 0\n\nThe internal kinetic energy can be expressed as:\n\nK = (3/2) * N * k_B * T\n\nwhere N is the number of particles in the core, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy can be expressed as:\n\nU = - (3/5) * (G * M_core^2 / R_core)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_core is the core mass, and R_core is the core radius.\n\nBy solving the virial theorem for T, we get:\n\nT ≈ - (2/3) * (U / (N * k_B))\n\nNow, we can estimate the core density (ρ) using the mass and radius of the core:\n\nρ ≈ M_core / (4/3 * π * R_core^3)\n\nTo find the minimum mass of the main sequence star, we need to consider the mass of the core and the mass of the envelope. The core mass is approximately 1.4 M☉, and the envelope mass can be estimated using the mass-radius relation for main sequence stars:\n\nM_star ≈ M_core + M_envelope ≈ 1.4 M☉ + M_envelope\n\nAssuming a mass-radius relation of M_envelope ∝ R_star^α, where α is a constant that depends on the star's composition and structure, we can estimate the minimum mass required for a main sequence star to undergo a supernova Type II explosion.\n\nFor a star with a mass of 8 M☉, the mass-radius relation gives a reasonable estimate of the minimum mass required for core collapse. This is a simplified calculation, and more accurate models would require detailed numerical simulations of stellar evolution and core collapse. However, this provides a general idea of the minimum mass needed for a main sequence star to undergo a supernova Type II explosion."
