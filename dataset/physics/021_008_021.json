    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following assumptions and formulas:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The black holes are non-rotating (Schwarzschild black holes).\n2. The black holes are in a quasi-circular orbit.\n3. The merger is in the final stages (inspiral phase).\n\nFormulas:\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital) = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * pi * (2 * r))\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW) = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Amplitude of gravitational waves (h) = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\n4. Chirp mass (M_chirp) = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nConstants:\n1. Speed of light (c) = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n2. Gravitational constant (G) = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\n3. Mass of the sun (M_sun) = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nGiven:\n1. Mass of black hole 1 (M1) = 10 * M_sun\n2. Mass of black hole 2 (M2) = 20 * M_sun\n3. Distance to the black holes (d) - not given, but let's assume they are at a distance of 1 Gpc (1 Gpc = 3.086 x 10^22 m)\n\nCalculations:\n\n1. Calculate the chirp mass (M_chirp):\nM_chirp = ((10 * M_sun) * (20 * M_sun))^(3/5) / ((10 * M_sun) + (20 * M_sun))^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 1.66 x 10^31 kg\n\n2. Estimate the orbital separation (r) during the final stages of the merger:\nr ≈ 6 * G * (M1 + M2) / c^2\nr ≈ 6 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (30 * 1.989 x 10^30) / (3 x 10^8)^2\nr ≈ 2.65 x 10^7 m\n\n3. Calculate the orbital frequency (f_orbital):\nf_orbital = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * pi * (2 * r))\nf_orbital ≈ (3 x 10^8)^3 / ((6.674 x 10^-11) * (30 * 1.989 x 10^30) * pi * (2 * 2.65 x 10^7))\nf_orbital ≈ 220 Hz\n\n4. Calculate the gravitational wave frequency (f_GW):\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbital\nf_GW ≈ 440 Hz\n\n5. Calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves (h):\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (pi * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\nh ≈ (4 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.66 x 10^31) * (pi * 440)^2/3) / ((3 x 10^8)^4 * (3.086 x 10^22))\nh ≈ 8.6 x 10^-22\n\nResults:\nThe expected frequency range of the gravitational waves produced by the final merger of the two black holes is around 440 Hz, and the amplitude of the gravitational waves is approximately 8.6 x 10^-22."
