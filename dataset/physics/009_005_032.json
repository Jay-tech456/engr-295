    "message_2": "To find the focal length of a convex lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nIn this case, u = 20 cm and v = 60 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n1/f = 1/20 + 1/60\n\nTo solve for f, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 20 and 60 is 60, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/f = 3/60 + 1/60\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\n1/f = 4/60\n\nTo find the focal length, we can take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation:\n\nf = 60/4\n\nf = 15 cm\n\nSo, the focal length of the convex lens is 15 cm."
