    "message_1": "A single crystal of copper with a length of 5 cm and a cross-sectional area of 0.1 cm² is heated from 25˚C to 100˚C. Calculate the thermal expansion coefficient of the crystal if the final length is 5.072 cm. (Assuming linear thermal expansion and neglecting any thermal deformation of the cross-sectional area)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the copper crystal, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\n\nwhere:\nΔL is the change in length (final length - initial length)\nL₀ is the initial length of the crystal\nα is the thermal expansion coefficient\nΔT is the change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature)\n\nFirst, let's find the change in length (ΔL) and the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔL = final length - initial length = 5.072 cm - 5 cm = 0.072 cm\nΔT = final temperature - initial temperature = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the thermal expansion coefficient (α):\n\nα = ΔL / (L₀ * ΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nα = 0.072 cm / (5 cm * 75°C) = 0.072 cm / 375 cm°C\n\nα = 1.92 x 10^(-4) cm/(cm°C)\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of the copper crystal is 1.92 x 10^(-4) cm/(cm°C)."
