    "message_2": "Supersymmetric models, or SUSY for short, can be used to explain the discrepancy between the predicted and observed mass of the Higgs boson by introducing new particles and symmetries to the existing Standard Model of particle physics. The Standard Model has been successful in describing the fundamental particles and forces in the universe, but it has some limitations, including the inability to explain the observed mass of the Higgs boson.\n\nSupersymmetry proposes that for every known particle in the Standard Model, there exists a corresponding \"superpartner\" particle with different spin properties. These superpartners can help stabilize the mass of the Higgs boson by canceling out the large quantum corrections that would otherwise drive its mass to very high values.\n\nIn supersymmetric models, the Higgs boson mass is determined by a combination of parameters, including the masses of the superpartners and the coupling strengths between them. By adjusting these parameters, it is possible to obtain a Higgs boson mass that is consistent with the observed value.\n\nMoreover, supersymmetry can also help address other issues in the Standard Model, such as the hierarchy problem (the large discrepancy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale) and the nature of dark matter. In many supersymmetric models, the lightest superpartner is stable and neutral, making it a suitable candidate for dark matter.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that, so far, experimental searches for supersymmetric particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have not found any direct evidence for their existence. This has led to constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric models, but it does not rule out the possibility that supersymmetry could still provide an explanation for the Higgs boson mass discrepancy and other outstanding problems in particle physics.\n\nIn summary, supersymmetric models can potentially explain the discrepancy between the predicted and observed mass of the Higgs boson by introducing new particles and symmetries that help stabilize its mass. However, experimental confirmation of supersymmetry is still lacking, and further research is needed to determine whether it is the correct solution to this problem."
