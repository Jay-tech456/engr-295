    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m away from the center of the sheet, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying rectangular sheet, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and d is the distance from the point to the sheet.\n\nHowever, since the current is uniformly distributed over the sheet, we need to consider the contribution of the magnetic field from each small section of the sheet. To do this, we can divide the sheet into small strips and then integrate the magnetic field contributions from each strip.\n\nLet's consider a strip of width dx at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the 0.3 m side. The length of the strip is 0.4 m. The current density J (current per unit area) can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / (0.3 m * 0.4 m)\n\nThe current in the strip of width dx is:\n\ndI = J * 0.4 m * dx\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field dB due to this strip at the point 0.2 m away from the center of the sheet:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * dI) / (2 * π * sqrt(x^2 + 0.2^2))\n\nTo find the total magnetic field, we need to integrate dB over the entire width of the sheet from -0.15 m to 0.15 m:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * dI) / (2 * π * sqrt(x^2 + 0.2^2)) dx from -0.15 to 0.15\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * ∫(1 / sqrt(x^2 + 0.2^2)) dx from -0.15 to 0.15\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let x = 0.2 * tanh(u), then dx = 0.2 * sech^2(u) du:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * ∫(1 / (0.2 * cosh(u))) * 0.2 * sech^2(u) du from u1 to u2\n\nwhere u1 and u2 are the values of u corresponding to x = -0.15 and x = 0.15, respectively.\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * ∫(sech(u) du) from u1 to u2\n\nNow, we can find the values of u1 and u2:\n\nu1 = atanh(-0.15 / 0.2) = -0.5493\nu2 = atanh(0.15 / 0.2) = 0.5493\n\nThe integral of sech(u) du is sinh^(-1)(tanh(u)), so:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * (sinh^(-1)(tanh(u2)) - sinh^(-1)(tanh(u1)))\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * (sinh^(-1)(tanh(0.5493)) - sinh^(-1)(tanh(-0.5493)))\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.4 m * J) / (2 * π) * 2 * sinh^(-1)(tanh(0.5493))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀ and J:\n\nJ = 2 A / (0.3 m * 0.4 m) = 16.67 A/m²\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.4 m * 16.67 A/m²) / (2 * π) * 2 * sinh^(-1)(tanh(0.5493))\n\nB ≈ 6.67 × 10^(-7) T * 2 * sinh^(-1)(tanh(0.5493))\n\nB ≈ 1.33 × 10^(-6) T * sinh^(-1)(tanh(0.5493))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nB ≈ 1.33 × 10^(-6) T * 0.499\n\nB ≈ 6.63 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m away from the center of the sheet is approximately 6.63 × 10^(-7) T."
