    "message_2": "To calculate the running coupling constant at the energy scale of 10 GeV for the strong interaction in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using the two-loop approximation, we will use the following formula:\n\nα_s(μ) = α_s(μ_0) / (1 + (α_s(μ_0) * β_0 * ln(μ/μ_0) / (2π)) + (α_s(μ_0)^2 * β_1 * ln(μ/μ_0)^2 / (4π^2)))\n\nHere, α_s(μ) is the strong coupling constant at the energy scale μ, α_s(μ_0) is the strong coupling constant at the reference energy scale μ_0, β_0 and β_1 are the one-loop and two-loop beta function coefficients, respectively, and ln is the natural logarithm.\n\nFor QCD with three active quark flavors (u, d, and s), the one-loop and two-loop beta function coefficients are:\n\nβ_0 = (11 * C_A - 2 * n_f) / 3 = (11 * 3 - 2 * 3) / 3 = 9\nβ_1 = (34 * C_A^2 - 10 * n_f * C_A - 6 * n_f * T_F) / 2 = (34 * 3^2 - 10 * 3 * 3 - 6 * 3 * 1/2) / 2 = 51\n\nThe reference energy scale μ_0 is typically chosen to be the Z boson mass, which is approximately 91.2 GeV. The strong coupling constant at this energy scale, α_s(μ_0), is approximately 0.118.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nα_s(10 GeV) = α_s(91.2 GeV) / (1 + (α_s(91.2 GeV) * β_0 * ln(10/91.2) / (2π)) + (α_s(91.2 GeV)^2 * β_1 * ln(10/91.2)^2 / (4π^2)))\nα_s(10 GeV) = 0.118 / (1 + (0.118 * 9 * ln(10/91.2) / (2π)) + (0.118^2 * 51 * ln(10/91.2)^2 / (4π^2)))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value:\n\nα_s(10 GeV) ≈ 0.118 / (1 - 0.0356 + 0.0061) ≈ 0.118 / 0.9705 ≈ 0.1216\n\nSo, the value of the running coupling constant at the energy scale of 10 GeV for the strong interaction in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using the two-loop approximation is approximately 0.1216."
