    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to freeze 20 grams of water into ice at its melting point, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × latent heat of fusion (L)\n\nwhere:\nm = 20 grams (mass of water)\nL = 334 joules per gram (latent heat of fusion of water)\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nQ = 20 grams × 334 joules/gram\n\nQ = 6680 joules\n\nSo, the amount of energy required to freeze 20 grams of water into ice at its melting point is 6680 joules."
