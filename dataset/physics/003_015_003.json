    "message_1": "A square loop of side length 0.1 m carries a current of 2 A in a counterclockwise direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), r is the distance from the wire segment to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and θ is the angle between the wire segment and the line connecting the wire segment to the point.\n\nSince the loop is symmetrical, we can find the magnetic field produced by one side of the square and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square. The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of the side is half the side length, which is 0.1 m / 2 = 0.05 m. The angle θ between the wire segment and the line connecting the wire segment to the center is 90 degrees (since the current is flowing counterclockwise and the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the current direction). Therefore, sinθ = sin(90) = 1.\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field produced by one side of the square:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m) / (4 * π * (0.05 m)²)\ndB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.1 m) / (π * 0.0025 m²)\ndB = (8 × 10^(-7) T * 0.1 m) / 0.0025 m²\ndB = 0.00032 T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the square loop, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * dB\nB_total = 4 * 0.00032 T\nB_total = 0.00128 T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current is flowing counterclockwise, the magnetic field at the center will be pointing out of the plane (upwards).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 0.00128 T, and its direction is upwards (out of the plane)."
