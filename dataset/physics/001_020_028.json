    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the beta function describes the dependence of the coupling constant (in this case, the fine structure constant) on the energy scale. The sign of the beta function is crucial in determining the behavior of the coupling constant as the energy scale changes.\n\nIn QED, the beta function is negative, which implies that the coupling constant decreases as the energy scale increases. This behavior is known as asymptotic freedom, although it is not as strong as in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The negative sign of the beta function in QED indicates that the interaction between charged particles becomes weaker at higher energies or shorter distances.\n\nThe renormalization of the theory is a procedure that allows us to remove the infinities that appear in the calculations of physical quantities in quantum field theories like QED. The renormalization process involves introducing a cutoff energy scale and redefining the coupling constant and other parameters of the theory to absorb the infinities. The dependence of the coupling constant on the energy scale, as described by the beta function, is a crucial aspect of the renormalization process.\n\nIn summary, the sign of the beta function in QED is negative, which indicates that the coupling constant decreases as the energy scale increases. This behavior is related to the renormalization of the theory, as the dependence of the coupling constant on the energy scale is an essential aspect of the renormalization process."
