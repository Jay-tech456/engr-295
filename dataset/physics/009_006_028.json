    "message_2": "To find the focal length of the concave mirror, we can use the formula:\n\nfocal length (f) = radius of curvature (R) / 2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, the focal length can be calculated as:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. We are given the object distance (u) as 30 cm. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(3 - 1)/30 = 1/v\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2/30 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can find the value of v:\n\nv = 30/2 = 15 cm\n\nSo, the image will form 15 cm away from the mirror.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u, we get:\n\nM = -15/30 = -1/2\n\nThe magnification of the image is -1/2, which means the image is inverted and half the size of the object."
