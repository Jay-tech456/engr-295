    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from various astrophysical sources and travel through the universe at nearly the speed of light. They were first discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess, who found that the ionization of the atmosphere increased with altitude, indicating the presence of energetic particles from outer space.\n\nComposition:\nThe composition of cosmic rays is primarily made up of protons (about 90%), followed by helium nuclei or alpha particles (about 9%), and heavier atomic nuclei (about 1%). Additionally, there are trace amounts of electrons and positrons. The heavier nuclei are mostly elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron, but all naturally occurring elements can be found in cosmic rays. The relative abundance of these elements in cosmic rays is different from their abundance in the solar system, which provides clues about the sources and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays.\n\nEnergy Spectrum:\nThe energy spectrum of cosmic rays spans a wide range, from about 10^9 electron volts (eV) to beyond 10^20 eV. The spectrum can be described by a power-law function, meaning that the number of cosmic rays decreases with increasing energy. There are three main features in the cosmic ray energy spectrum:\n\n1. The \"knee\": Around 10^15 eV, the spectrum steepens, and the flux of cosmic rays decreases more rapidly with increasing energy. The exact cause of the knee is still under investigation, but it is believed to be related to the maximum energy that can be achieved by cosmic rays in supernova remnants, which are considered the primary source of galactic cosmic rays.\n\n2. The \"second knee\": At around 10^17 eV, the spectrum steepens again, which might be related to the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays or a change in the acceleration mechanism.\n\n3. The \"ankle\": Around 10^18.5 eV, the spectrum flattens slightly, which is thought to be due to the increasing contribution of extragalactic cosmic rays.\n\nPropagation:\nCosmic rays propagate through the universe by interacting with magnetic fields, both in their sources and in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Galactic cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova remnants, while extragalactic cosmic rays may originate from active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, or other energetic astrophysical phenomena.\n\nThe propagation of cosmic rays is a complex process involving scattering, diffusion, and energy loss due to interactions with photons and other particles. In the Milky Way, cosmic rays are confined by the galactic magnetic field and diffuse through the interstellar medium, which causes their energy spectrum to be modified and their arrival directions to be isotropized. At higher energies, cosmic rays can escape the galaxy and propagate through the intergalactic medium, where they are subject to additional energy losses and deflections by extragalactic magnetic fields.\n\nUnderstanding the composition, energy spectrum, and propagation of cosmic rays is essential for studying their sources, acceleration mechanisms, and the role they play in the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole."
