    "message_1": "A student is given a rectangular glass prism with a refractive index of 1.5. The angle between the two faces of the prism is 60 degrees. If a light ray enters from one face of the prism at an angle of incidence of 45 degrees, what is the angle of deviation of the light ray inside the prism due to total internal reflection?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine if total internal reflection occurs inside the prism. To do this, we will find the critical angle for the glass-air interface using Snell's law.\n\n1. Calculate the critical angle:\nn1 * sin(critical_angle) = n2 * sin(90°)\n1.5 * sin(critical_angle) = 1 * sin(90°)\nsin(critical_angle) = 1/1.5\ncritical_angle = arcsin(1/1.5) ≈ 41.81°\n\n2. Calculate the angle of refraction at the first interface using Snell's law:\nn1 * sin(angle_of_incidence) = n2 * sin(angle_of_refraction)\n1 * sin(45°) = 1.5 * sin(angle_of_refraction)\nsin(angle_of_refraction) = sin(45°) / 1.5\nangle_of_refraction = arcsin(sin(45°) / 1.5) ≈ 27.52°\n\n3. Calculate the angle of incidence at the second interface:\nangle_of_incidence_2 = 60° - angle_of_refraction ≈ 60° - 27.52° ≈ 32.48°\n\nSince the angle of incidence at the second interface (32.48°) is less than the critical angle (41.81°), total internal reflection does not occur inside the prism. Therefore, the angle of deviation due to total internal reflection is not applicable in this case."
