    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the 4th excited state and the 6th excited state of a hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for energy levels:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number. The negative sign indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus.\n\nFor the 4th excited state, n = 4 + 1 = 5 (since the ground state is n = 1, the first excited state is n = 2, and so on). For the 6th excited state, n = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy levels for these two states:\n\nE_5 = -13.6 eV / 5^2 = -13.6 eV / 25 ≈ -0.544 eV\nE_7 = -13.6 eV / 7^2 = -13.6 eV / 49 ≈ -0.27755 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the 4th and 6th excited states is the absolute difference between these two energy levels:\n\nΔE = |E_7 - E_5| = |-0.27755 - (-0.544)| ≈ 0.26645 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the 4th excited state and the 6th excited state of a hydrogen atom is approximately 0.26645 eV."
