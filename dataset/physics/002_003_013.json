When heat is added to the system, the gas expands to 6.0 liters and its temperature rises to 400 K. Calculate the change in internal energy of the gas.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the change in internal energy of the gas, we can use the first law of thermodynamics:\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nwhere ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.\n\nFirst, let's find the work done by the system. Work done by the gas during expansion can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = -P * ΔV\n\nwhere P is the constant pressure and ΔV is the change in volume. In this case, the pressure is 2.5 atm and the change in volume is (6.0 - 4.0) L = 2.0 L. To use SI units, we need to convert the pressure to Pascals (Pa) and the volume to cubic meters (m³).\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n1 L = 0.001 m³\n\nP = 2.5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 253312.5 Pa\nΔV = 2.0 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.002 m³\n\nNow we can calculate the work done:\n\nW = -P * ΔV = -253312.5 Pa * 0.002 m³ = -506.625 J\n\nNext, we need to find the heat added to the system. We can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of gas:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature. We can rearrange the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nUsing the initial conditions (V = 4.0 L and T = 300 K):\n\nn = (253312.5 Pa * 0.004 m³) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 300 K) = 0.0409 mol\n\nNow we can find the heat added to the system using the equation:\n\nQ = n * Cv * ΔT\n\nwhere Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume and ΔT is the change in temperature. For an ideal diatomic gas, Cv is approximately 5/2 * R. The change in temperature is (400 - 300) K = 100 K.\n\nCv = 5/2 * 8.314 J/mol·K = 20.785 J/mol·K\n\nNow we can calculate the heat added:\n\nQ = 0.0409 mol * 20.785 J/mol·K * 100 K = 84.809 J\n\nFinally, we can find the change in internal energy using the first law of thermodynamics:\n\nΔU = Q - W = 84.809 J - (-506.625 J) = 591.434 J\n\nThe change in internal energy of the gas is approximately 591.4 J."
