    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the position of the dark fringes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m + 1/2) * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central bright fringe and the dark fringe, m is the order of the dark fringe (m = 0 for the first dark fringe), λ is the wavelength of light, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle θ. We can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ y / L\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central bright fringe and the first dark fringe (3 cm = 0.03 m), and L is the distance between the screen and the slits (2 m).\n\nθ ≈ 0.03 / 2 = 0.015\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula for the dark fringes:\n\n0.015 = (0 + 1/2) * (600 * 10^(-9) / d)\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd = (600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 0.015) = 2 * 10^(-5) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit experiment is 2 * 10^(-5) meters, or 20 micrometers."
