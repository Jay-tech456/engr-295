    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane gas, we need to first write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nNext, we can use Hess's Law, which states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants, multiplied by their respective stoichiometric coefficients:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf(products)] - Σ [ΔHf(reactants)]\n\nFor this reaction, the enthalpy change is:\n\nΔH = [1 * ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [2 * ΔHf(CH4) + 0 * ΔHf(O2)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (O2 in this case) is zero, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nΔH = [1 * ΔHf(CO2) + 2 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [2 * ΔHf(CH4)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given standard enthalpies of formation:\n\nΔH = [1 * (-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [2 * (-74.8 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH = [-393.5 + 2 * (-285.8)] - [2 * (-74.8)]\n\nΔH = [-393.5 - 571.6] - [-149.6]\n\nΔH = [-965.1] - [-149.6]\n\nΔH = -815.5 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are calculating the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane gas, we need to multiply the enthalpy change per mole by 2:\n\nΔH_total = -815.5 kJ/mol * 2 moles = -1631 kJ\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of methane gas at 25°C and standard pressure is -1631 kJ."
