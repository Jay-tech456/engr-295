    "message_1": "A spaceship is moving at a velocity of 0.6c relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The ship is carrying a clock that is synchronized with a clock on Earth before the launch. Calculate the time dilation factor for the clock on the spaceship and determine how much time will have passed on the spaceship clock when the spaceship travels a distance of 100 light-years. Finally, calculate how much time will have passed on Earth during this trip, according to the stationary observer.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation factor, we can use the Lorentz factor formula:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor (time dilation factor), v is the velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = 0.6c\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nThe time dilation factor is approximately 1.25.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much time will have passed on the spaceship clock when the spaceship travels a distance of 100 light-years.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how long it takes for the spaceship to travel 100 light-years at a velocity of 0.6c.\n\ntime = distance / velocity\ntime = 100 light-years / 0.6c\ntime ≈ 166.67 years\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation factor to find out how much time will have passed on the spaceship clock:\n\ntime_on_spaceship = time / γ\ntime_on_spaceship = 166.67 years / 1.25\ntime_on_spaceship ≈ 133.33 years\n\nSo, approximately 133.33 years will have passed on the spaceship clock when the spaceship travels a distance of 100 light-years.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much time will have passed on Earth during this trip, according to the stationary observer. Since the observer on Earth is stationary, we can use the time it takes for the spaceship to travel 100 light-years at a velocity of 0.6c:\n\ntime_on_Earth = 166.67 years\n\nSo, approximately 166.67 years will have passed on Earth during this trip, according to the stationary observer."
