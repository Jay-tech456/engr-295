    "message_2": "Plasma-based cosmologists, also known as proponents of plasma cosmology, propose that the large-scale structure and behavior of the universe can be better understood by considering the role of plasma and electromagnetism, rather than relying solely on gravity as the dominant force. Plasma is an ionized gas consisting of charged particles, such as electrons and ions, and it makes up more than 99% of the visible universe.\n\nTo explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe, plasma cosmologists focus on the electromagnetic properties of plasma. They argue that the large-scale structure of the universe is shaped by the interaction of cosmic plasma with magnetic fields and electric currents. These interactions can generate forces that are orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, which could potentially drive the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nOne possible mechanism for this accelerated expansion is the concept of \"double layers\" in plasma. Double layers are regions where there is a strong electric field and a separation of charges, leading to a potential difference. These double layers can store energy and, under certain conditions, release it in the form of electromagnetic forces that can drive the expansion of the universe.\n\nAnother possibility is the interaction between cosmic plasma filaments, which are large-scale structures formed by the self-organization of plasma under the influence of electromagnetic forces. These filaments can interact with each other, generating forces that could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nIt is important to note that plasma cosmology is not widely accepted by the mainstream scientific community, as it lacks sufficient empirical evidence and does not fully explain various observed phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the distribution of galaxy clusters. The current standard model of cosmology, known as the Lambda-CDM model, attributes the accelerated expansion of the universe to dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a repulsive force, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate."
