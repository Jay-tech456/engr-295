    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. The accurate measurement of the Higgs boson mass is crucial for testing the validity of the Standard Model and understanding the properties of the Higgs field.\n\nThe current experimental techniques used to measure the mass of the Higgs boson primarily involve analyzing the decay products of the Higgs boson in particle collisions at the LHC. The two main decay channels used for this purpose are the Higgs boson decaying into two photons (H→γγ) and the Higgs boson decaying into four leptons (H→ZZ*→4l, where l is an electron or a muon). These channels have relatively clean experimental signatures and low backgrounds, making them suitable for precise measurements.\n\nThe accuracy limit of the Higgs boson mass measurement with the current experimental techniques is around 0.2% or better. The combined measurement from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, using the full dataset collected during the first run of the LHC (2010-2012), determined the mass of the Higgs boson to be 125.09 ± 0.24 GeV (giga-electron volts). This corresponds to a relative uncertainty of about 0.19%.\n\nThe implications of the Higgs boson mass measurement for the validity of the Standard Model are significant. The measured mass is consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model, confirming the existence of the Higgs boson and the Higgs mechanism. However, the precise value of the Higgs boson mass also has implications for the stability of the Higgs field and the vacuum state of the universe. The measured mass lies in a region where the vacuum is metastable, meaning that the universe could be in a state that is not the true minimum energy state. This raises questions about the long-term stability of the universe and suggests that there might be new physics beyond the Standard Model that could stabilize the vacuum.\n\nMoreover, the Higgs boson mass measurement also provides constraints on possible extensions of the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, which predict additional Higgs bosons and other new particles. The accurate determination of the Higgs boson mass helps to narrow down the parameter space of these models and guide the search for new physics at the LHC and future collider experiments.\n\nIn summary, the current accuracy limit of the Higgs boson mass measurement with known experimental techniques is around 0.2% or better. This precise measurement has significant implications for the validity of the Standard Model, the stability of the Higgs field and the vacuum state of the universe, and the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model."
