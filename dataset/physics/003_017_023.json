    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetric, we can consider the magnetic field due to one side of the loop and multiply the result by 4. Let's consider the side of the loop parallel to the X-axis and closest to point P. The center of this side is at (5 cm, 10 cm) in the XY plane.\n\nThe position vector r for this side can be written as:\n\nr = (0 - 5 cm)i + (15 cm - 10 cm)j = -5i + 5j (in cm)\n\nThe differential length vector dl for this side is along the X-axis:\n\ndl = dxi\n\nNow, we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = dx * (-5i + 5j) x i = -5dxj - 5dxk\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart Law equation:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 A * (-5dxj - 5dxk)) / |-5i + 5j|^3\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((-5)^2 + 5^2) = 5√2 cm\n\nSo, |r|^3 = (5√2)^3 = 250√2 cm³\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * (-5dxj - 5dxk)) / (250√2 cm³)\n\nThe 4π terms cancel out, and we can convert cm to meters by multiplying by 0.01:\n\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2 A * (-5dxj - 5dxk)) / (2.5√2 m³)\n\ndB = (-2 × 10^(-7) T/√2 m²) * (dxj + dxk)\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB over the length of the side (from x = 0 to x = 10 cm) to find the magnetic field due to this side:\n\nB_side = ∫(-2 × 10^(-7) T/√2 m²) * (dxj + dxk) from x = 0 to x = 0.1 m\n\nB_side = (-2 × 10^(-7) T/√2 m²) * (0.1j + 0.1k)\n\nSince there are 4 sides, we can multiply this result by 4 to find the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = (-8 × 10^(-7) T/√2 m²) * (0.1j + 0.1k)\n\nB_total = (-4 × 10^(-6) T/√2) * (j + k)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately (-4 × 10^(-6) T/√2) * (j + k)."
