    "message_2": "The Bohr radius is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n=1). It is denoted by a₀ and is given by the formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m_e is the electron mass, and e is the elementary charge.\n\nThe radius of the electron orbit in a hydrogen atom for any energy level n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_n = n² * a₀\n\nWhen the electron transitions from energy level n=2 to n=1, it moves from a higher energy orbit to the ground state orbit. The Bohr radius we are interested in is for the ground state (n=1). Therefore, we can use the formula for r_n with n=1:\n\nr_1 = 1² * a₀ = a₀\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom when the electron transitions from energy level n=2 to n=1 is equal to the Bohr radius a₀ itself, which is approximately 0.529 Å (angstroms) or 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m (meters)."
