    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo find the common denominator, we can multiply both sides by 60v:\n\n3v = 2v + 60\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 60 cm from the lens.\n\nNext, we can find the height of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nMagnification (m) = Image height (h') / Object height (h) = Image distance (v) / Object distance (u)\n\nWe know the magnification, object height, and object distance, so we can solve for the image height:\n\nh' = m * h\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnification:\n\nm = v / u = 60 / 30 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the image height:\n\nh' = 2 * 3 = 6 cm\n\nThe image formed by the lens is 6 cm tall and is located 60 cm away from the lens."
