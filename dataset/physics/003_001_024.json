    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire, we can use Ampere's Law, specifically the Biot-Savart Law. For an infinitely long and straight wire, the formula simplifies to:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (2 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π x 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 80π x 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 2.51 x 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field generated by the current-carrying wire at a distance of 5 cm is approximately 2.51 x 10^(-5) Tesla."
