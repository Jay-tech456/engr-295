    "message_2": "The relationship between sound frequency and pitch perception in humans is a direct one. Sound frequency refers to the number of vibrations or cycles per second of a sound wave, measured in Hertz (Hz). Pitch, on the other hand, is the subjective perception of the frequency of a sound, and it is how humans perceive the highness or lowness of a sound.\n\nAs the frequency of a sound wave increases, the pitch of the sound is perceived as higher. Conversely, as the frequency decreases, the pitch is perceived as lower. This relationship is generally linear, meaning that a doubling of the frequency corresponds to a perceived doubling of the pitch.\n\nThe frequency range of audible sound for humans is typically defined as being between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). This range, however, can vary among individuals, and it tends to decrease with age, particularly at the higher frequencies. Sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz are referred to as infrasound, while those above 20 kHz are called ultrasound. These sounds are not typically audible to humans, but they can be detected and utilized by certain animals and specialized equipment."
