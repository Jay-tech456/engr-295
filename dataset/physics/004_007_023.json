    "message_2": "The singularity theorems in general relativity, developed by Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking in the 1960s, provide conditions under which spacetime singularities are expected to form. These theorems are based on the concepts of geodesic incompleteness and trapped surfaces. The main mathematical conditions necessary for the existence of singularities according to these theorems are:\n\n1. Strong energy condition: The energy-momentum tensor T_ab must satisfy the strong energy condition, which states that for any timelike vector V^a, (T_ab - (1/2)Tg_ab)V^aV^b â‰¥ 0, where T is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and g_ab is the metric tensor. This condition implies that the energy density, as measured by any observer, is non-negative.\n\n2. Trapped surface: A trapped surface is a closed two-dimensional spacelike surface such that the expansion of the future-directed null geodesics orthogonal to the surface is negative. The presence of a trapped surface indicates that the spacetime is collapsing, and it is a key ingredient in the formation of singularities.\n\n3. Global hyperbolicity: The spacetime must be globally hyperbolic, which means that it can be foliated by a family of spacelike Cauchy surfaces. This condition ensures that the spacetime is well-behaved and deterministic.\n\n4. Non-compactness: The spacetime must be non-compact, which means that it cannot be covered by a compact region. This condition is necessary to avoid trivial cases where the spacetime is simply a compact manifold without boundary.\n\nGiven these conditions, the singularity theorems state that if a spacetime satisfies the strong energy condition and contains a trapped surface, then it must be geodesically incomplete, meaning that there exist incomplete timelike or null geodesics. This geodesic incompleteness is interpreted as the existence of a singularity in the spacetime."
