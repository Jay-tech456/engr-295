    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's equation relates the focal length (f) of a lens to the radii of curvature of its two surfaces (R1 and R2) and the refractive index (n) of the lens material. The equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nSince the lens is convex, both surfaces are curved outwards. For simplicity, let's assume that both surfaces have the same radius of curvature (R). In this case, R1 = R and R2 = -R. Now, we can rewrite the Lensmaker's equation as:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R - (-1/R))\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the refractive index (n) is 1.5, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/20 = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R - (-1/R))\n\n1/20 = 0.5 * (2/R)\n\nNow, we can solve for R:\n\n1/20 = 1/R\n\nR = 20 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the lens is 20 cm."
