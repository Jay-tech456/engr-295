    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of propane, we need to use the standard enthalpies of formation for all the compounds involved in the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation for propane is given as -103.85 kJ/mol. We also need the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2(g) and H2O(l). These values are:\n\nΔHf° (CO2, g) = -393.5 kJ/mol\nΔHf° (H2O, l) = -285.8 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction:\n\nΔH = Σ [ΔHf° (products)] - Σ [ΔHf° (reactants)]\n\nΔH = [3 * ΔHf° (CO2, g) + 4 * ΔHf° (H2O, l)] - [ΔHf° (C3H8, g) + 5 * ΔHf° (O2, g)]\n\nSince the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state (O2, g) is zero, we can simplify the equation:\n\nΔH = [3 * (-393.5) + 4 * (-285.8)] - [(-103.85)]\n\nΔH = (-1180.5 + (-1143.2)) - (-103.85)\nΔH = -2323.7 + 103.85\nΔH = -2219.85 kJ/mol\n\nNow we need to find the enthalpy change for 5 moles of propane:\n\nΔH_total = ΔH * moles of propane\nΔH_total = -2219.85 kJ/mol * 5 moles\nΔH_total = -11099.25 kJ\n\nSo the enthalpy change when 5 moles of propane are combusted completely in oxygen is -11099.25 kJ."
