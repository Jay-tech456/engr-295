    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the crystal, we can use the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nχ = C / (T - θ)\n\nwhere C is the Curie constant, T is the temperature, and θ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. The Curie constant (C) is given by:\n\nC = (μ₀ * μ_B^2 * N * g^2 * J * (J + 1)) / (3 * k_B)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the vacuum permeability (4π × 10^(-7) T m/A), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T), N is the number of ions per unit volume, g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for a free electron), J is the total angular momentum quantum number, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10^(-23) J/K).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total angular momentum quantum number (J) using the given spin-only magnetic moment (μ) and the formula:\n\nμ = g * μ_B * sqrt(J * (J + 1))\n\nGiven that μ = 1.73 Bohr magnetons, we can solve for J:\n\n1.73 = 2 * μ_B * sqrt(J * (J + 1))\n\nDividing both sides by 2 * μ_B:\n\n1.73 / (2 * μ_B) = sqrt(J * (J + 1))\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(1.73 / (2 * μ_B))^2 = J * (J + 1)\n\nNow we can plug in the value of μ_B:\n\n(1.73 / (2 * 9.274 × 10^(-24)))^2 = J * (J + 1)\n\nSolving for J:\n\nJ * (J + 1) ≈ 3.48\n\nBy inspection, we can see that J ≈ 1 (since 1 * 2 = 2, which is close to 3.48).\n\nNow we can calculate the Curie constant (C):\n\nC = (4π × 10^(-7) * (9.274 × 10^(-24))^2 * 10^22 * 2^2 * 1 * (1 + 1)) / (3 * 1.381 × 10^(-23))\n\nC ≈ 0.223 J/(T*m^3)\n\nNext, we need to find the Curie-Weiss temperature (θ). We can use the formula:\n\nθ = -2 * z * J * J_ex / k_B\n\nwhere z is the number of nearest neighbors, and J_ex is the exchange energy. For a cubic structure, z = 6. Given that J_ex = 7.2 meV, we can convert it to joules:\n\nJ_ex = 7.2 × 10^(-3) * 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV ≈ 1.153 × 10^(-21) J\n\nNow we can calculate θ:\n\nθ = -2 * 6 * 1 * 1.153 × 10^(-21) / (1.381 × 10^(-23))\n\nθ ≈ -10 K\n\nFinally, we can calculate the magnetic susceptibility (χ) using the Curie-Weiss law. Note that we need the temperature (T) to find the magnetic susceptibility. Let's assume room temperature, T = 300 K:\n\nχ = C / (T - θ)\n\nχ = 0.223 / (300 - (-10))\n\nχ ≈ 0.223 / 310\n\nχ ≈ 7.19 × 10^(-4) T^(-1) m^3\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility of the crystal at room temperature is approximately 7.19 × 10^(-4) T^(-1) m^3."
