    "message_1": "A physics student has to determine the maximum distance that a signal can be transmitted through an optical fiber with a core diameter of 50 micrometers and a numerical aperture of 0.2. The signal is a monochromatic light beam of wavelength 1550 nanometers and the attenuation coefficient of the fiber is 0.2 decibels per kilometer. What is the maximum distance that the signal can travel through the fiber before it becomes too weak to be detected?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum distance the signal can travel through the fiber before it becomes too weak to be detected, we need to consider the attenuation of the signal. The attenuation coefficient is given in decibels per kilometer (dB/km), which is a logarithmic scale. \n\nFirst, we need to determine the maximum allowable loss in decibels (dB). This value depends on the specific system and the sensitivity of the receiver. For this problem, let's assume the maximum allowable loss is 20 dB, which is a common value for many optical communication systems.\n\nNow, we can use the attenuation coefficient to find the maximum distance the signal can travel. The formula for calculating the distance is:\n\nDistance (km) = (Maximum allowable loss (dB)) / (Attenuation coefficient (dB/km))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nDistance (km) = (20 dB) / (0.2 dB/km) = 100 km\n\nSo, the maximum distance that the signal can travel through the optical fiber before it becomes too weak to be detected is 100 kilometers."
