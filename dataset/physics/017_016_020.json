    "message_2": "The mechanical behavior of biological cells changes significantly when subjected to external forces and stress. These changes can affect cell shape, structure, and function, as well as influence cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Soft matter physics, which deals with materials that have properties between those of liquids and solids, can provide valuable insights into understanding these changes.\n\nWhen biological cells are subjected to external forces and stress, several mechanical responses can be observed:\n\n1. Deformation: Cells may change their shape and structure in response to applied forces. This deformation can be elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible).\n\n2. Stiffening: Cells can increase their stiffness in response to external forces, which helps them maintain their structural integrity and resist deformation.\n\n3. Force transmission: Cells can transmit forces through their cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments that provide mechanical support and help maintain cell shape.\n\n4. Mechanotransduction: Cells can convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals, which can then regulate various cellular processes, such as gene expression and protein synthesis.\n\nTo study these mechanical behaviors, several techniques from soft matter physics can be employed:\n\n1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM): AFM can be used to measure the mechanical properties of cells, such as stiffness and elasticity, by applying a controlled force to the cell surface and monitoring the resulting deformation.\n\n2. Optical tweezers: This technique uses focused laser beams to trap and manipulate microscopic objects, such as cells or cell components. By applying controlled forces to cells, researchers can study their mechanical responses and investigate the role of specific cellular structures in force transmission and mechanotransduction.\n\n3. Magnetic tweezers: Similar to optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers use magnetic fields to apply forces to cells or cell components. This technique is particularly useful for studying the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and its role in force transmission.\n\n4. Micropipette aspiration: In this technique, a small glass pipette is used to apply suction to a cell, causing it to deform. By measuring the deformation and the applied force, researchers can determine the mechanical properties of the cell, such as its stiffness and viscosity.\n\n5. Microfluidics: Microfluidic devices can be used to subject cells to controlled fluid flow and shear stress, allowing researchers to study the effects of these forces on cell behavior and function.\n\nBy using these techniques from soft matter physics, researchers can gain a better understanding of the mechanical behavior of biological cells under external forces and stress, and how these changes affect cellular processes and functions. This knowledge can have important implications for fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and cancer research."
