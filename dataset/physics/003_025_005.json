    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the resistor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current (2 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / 0.1 m\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the resistor is 8 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
