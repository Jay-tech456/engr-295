    "message_2": "The estimated rate of gravitational wave detections by future observatories depends on the advancements in detector sensitivity and the types of sources being observed. Currently, the main observatories detecting gravitational waves are the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer.\n\nAs of now, LIGO and Virgo have detected gravitational waves from dozens of events, primarily involving the mergers of binary black holes and binary neutron stars. The current rate of detections is roughly one event per month, but this is expected to increase significantly as the sensitivity of the detectors improves.\n\nIn the near future, the LIGO and Virgo detectors will undergo upgrades to improve their sensitivity, which will allow them to detect more events and at greater distances. Additionally, new observatories, such as the KAGRA detector in Japan and the proposed LIGO-India project, will join the global network of gravitational wave detectors, further increasing the detection rate.\n\nWith these improvements and new observatories, it is estimated that the rate of gravitational wave detections could increase to several events per week or even per day. This would represent a significant increase compared to the current rate of detections.\n\nIn the longer term, space-based observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to be launched in the 2030s. These observatories will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, allowing them to detect events involving supermassive black holes and other sources that are currently inaccessible to ground-based detectors. This will further increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand our understanding of the universe."
