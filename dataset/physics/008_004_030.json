    "message_2": "The current experimental value for the mass of the top quark is approximately 172.76 GeV/c², with an uncertainty of about 0.30 GeV/c². This value is obtained from a combination of measurements from the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Fermilab Tevatron Collider experiments.\n\nThe top quark is typically produced in pairs (top and anti-top) in high-energy proton-proton or proton-antiproton collisions at particle colliders. The top quark is unstable and decays almost immediately into other particles, such as a bottom quark and a W boson. These decay products can then be detected by the collider's detectors.\n\nThe mass of the top quark is measured using several different methods, including:\n\n1. The direct reconstruction method: This involves reconstructing the top quark's decay products and calculating the invariant mass of the top quark. This is done by combining the measured energies and momenta of the decay products, taking into account the detector's resolution and other experimental effects.\n\n2. The template method: This method compares the observed distributions of the decay products (such as the transverse momentum or the invariant mass) to theoretical predictions for different top quark masses. The mass that provides the best agreement between the observed data and the theoretical predictions is taken as the measured mass.\n\n3. The matrix element method: This method uses the full probability density function of the production and decay of the top quark, taking into account the detector's response and the underlying physics processes. The mass is extracted by comparing the observed data to the expected distributions for different top quark masses.\n\nThese methods are applied to the data collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC and the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron. The results from these experiments are then combined to obtain the current best estimate for the mass of the top quark."
