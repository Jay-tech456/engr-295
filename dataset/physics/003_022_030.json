    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance from a wire carrying a current, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nFor the first part of the problem, we have I = 2 A and r = 5 cm = 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\nB1 = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\nB1 = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 8 × 10^(-6) T (tesla).\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we have I = 4 A (current doubled) and r = 10 cm = 0.1 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB2 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\nB2 = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2 m)\nB2 = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the wire when the current is doubled to 4 A is also 8 × 10^(-6) T."
