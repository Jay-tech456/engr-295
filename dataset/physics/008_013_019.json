    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is a massive elementary particle that belongs to the lepton family, which also includes electrons and muons. It is the heaviest of the three leptons and has a charge of -1. Tau leptons are unstable and decay via the weak force, which is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, responsible for processes like beta decay in atomic nuclei.\n\nThe decay modes of the tau lepton can be classified into two main categories: leptonic decays and hadronic decays.\n\n1. Leptonic Decays:\nIn leptonic decays, the tau lepton decays into a lighter lepton (electron or muon) and two neutrinos. The process conserves lepton flavor, meaning that the total number of tau leptons minus the total number of tau neutrinos remains constant. The leptonic decay modes are:\n\na) τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̅_τ\nb) τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̅_τ\n\nIn both cases, the weak force is mediated by the exchange of a W⁻ boson, which is a carrier of the weak force. The tau lepton interacts with the W⁻ boson, transforming into a tau neutrino, while the W⁻ boson decays into a lighter lepton and its corresponding neutrino.\n\n2. Hadronic Decays:\nIn hadronic decays, the tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes are more diverse and can involve various combinations of mesons (particles composed of a quark and an antiquark) and sometimes baryons (particles composed of three quarks). Some common hadronic decay modes include:\n\na) τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ\nb) τ⁻ → ρ⁻ + ν_τ\nc) τ⁻ → K⁻ + ν_τ\nd) τ⁻ → a₁⁻ + ν_τ\n\nIn these decays, the weak force is also mediated by the exchange of a W⁻ boson. The tau lepton interacts with the W⁻ boson, transforming into a tau neutrino, while the W⁻ boson decays into the appropriate combination of quarks that form the resulting hadrons.\n\nIn summary, the decay modes of the tau lepton are connected to the weak force through the exchange of W⁻ bosons, which mediate the weak interactions responsible for the decay processes. Both leptonic and hadronic decays involve the transformation of the tau lepton into a tau neutrino and other particles, conserving lepton flavor and other quantum numbers."
