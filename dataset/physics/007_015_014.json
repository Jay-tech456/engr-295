    "message_2": "To calculate the binding energy of a helium nucleus, we first need to find the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the sum of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons and the mass of the helium nucleus.\n\nA helium nucleus consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, the sum of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons is:\n\nmass_protons = 2 * 1.00728 amu = 2.01456 amu\nmass_neutrons = 2 * 1.00867 amu = 2.01734 amu\ntotal_mass = mass_protons + mass_neutrons = 2.01456 amu + 2.01734 amu = 4.03190 amu\n\nNow, we can find the mass defect:\n\nmass_defect = total_mass - mass_helium_nucleus = 4.03190 amu - 4.00260 amu = 0.02930 amu\n\nNext, we need to convert the mass defect from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg:\n\nmass_defect_kg = 0.02930 amu * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/amu) = 4.86498 x 10^-29 kg\n\nNow, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, to find the binding energy. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s:\n\nbinding_energy = mass_defect_kg * c^2 = 4.86498 x 10^-29 kg * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2 = 4.37848 x 10^-12 Joules\n\nTo convert the binding energy to electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^-19 Joules:\n\nbinding_energy_eV = 4.37848 x 10^-12 Joules * (1 eV / 1.60218 x 10^-19 Joules) = 2.733 x 10^7 eV\n\nSo, the binding energy of a helium nucleus is approximately 2.733 x 10^7 electron volts (eV)."
