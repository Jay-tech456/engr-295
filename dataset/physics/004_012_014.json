    "message_2": "To determine the age of the universe using the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and cosmological parameters, we need to consider the Friedmann equation, which is derived from the FLRW metric. The Friedmann equation is given by:\n\nH^2 = (8πG/3)ρ - k*c^2/a^2 + Λc^2/3\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, ρ is the total energy density of the universe, k is the curvature constant, c is the speed of light, a is the scale factor, and Λ is the cosmological constant.\n\nThe Hubble parameter H is related to the Hubble constant H0 by:\n\nH = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m/a^3 + Ω_r/a^4 + Ω_k/a^2 + Ω_Λ)\n\nwhere Ω_m is the matter density parameter, Ω_r is the radiation density parameter, Ω_k is the curvature density parameter, and Ω_Λ is the dark energy density parameter.\n\nTo find the age of the universe, we need to integrate the inverse of the Hubble parameter with respect to the scale factor a:\n\nt = ∫(1/H)da\n\nUsing the current values of the cosmological parameters, we can estimate the age of the universe. The most recent measurements from the Planck satellite give the following values:\n\nH0 ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc\nΩ_m ≈ 0.315\nΩ_r ≈ 9.4 x 10^(-5)\nΩ_k ≈ 0 (assuming a flat universe)\nΩ_Λ ≈ 0.685\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Hubble parameter equation:\n\nH = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m/a^3 + Ω_r/a^4 + Ω_k/a^2 + Ω_Λ)\n\nTo find the age of the universe, we need to integrate this expression from a=0 to a=1 (the current scale factor). This integral is difficult to solve analytically, so we typically use numerical methods to find the solution.\n\nUsing numerical integration, we find that the age of the universe is approximately:\n\nt ≈ 13.8 billion years\n\nThis is the current best estimate for the age of the universe using the FLRW metric and cosmological parameters."
