    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the interactions between quarks and gluons mediated by the strong nuclear force. Several experimental techniques can be used to measure the strong coupling constant, including:\n\n1. Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS): In this technique, high-energy electrons or muons are scattered off nucleons (protons or neutrons), probing the quark and gluon structure inside the nucleons. The cross-sections and asymmetries measured in these experiments can be used to extract αs.\n\n2. Hadron Collider Experiments: Measurements of cross-sections and event shapes in high-energy proton-proton or proton-antiproton collisions at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or the Tevatron, can be used to determine αs. These measurements involve the production of jets (collimated sprays of hadrons) resulting from the fragmentation of quarks and gluons.\n\n3. Lattice QCD: This is a non-perturbative approach to solving QCD on a discretized space-time lattice. By simulating QCD on a computer, one can calculate various observables, such as hadron masses and decay constants, and extract αs by comparing these results to experimental data.\n\n4. Heavy Quarkonia: The spectroscopy of heavy quark-antiquark bound states, such as charmonium (cc̅) and bottomonium (bb̅), can be used to determine αs. The energy levels of these systems are sensitive to the strong coupling constant due to the strong force binding the quarks together.\n\nThe current accepted value of the strong coupling constant depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, as αs exhibits a property called \"asymptotic freedom,\" meaning that it decreases as the energy scale increases. At the Z boson mass scale (about 91 GeV), the Particle Data Group (PDG) reports a value of αs(MZ) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011. This value is obtained by combining various experimental measurements and theoretical calculations."
