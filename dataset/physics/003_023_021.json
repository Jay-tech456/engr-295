    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields to find the total magnetic field at the given point.\n\nLet's consider the point P, which is 5 cm away from the center of the loop, along the perpendicular bisector of the loop. We can calculate the magnetic field due to each segment and sum them up.\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the magnetic field will be in the same direction (out of the plane), so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one segment and multiply it by 2. Similarly, for the left and right segments, the magnetic field will be in the same direction (into the plane), so we can calculate the magnetic field due to one segment and multiply it by 2.\n\nLet's first calculate the magnetic field due to the top segment. The length of this segment is 20 cm, and it is at a distance of 5 cm + (10 cm / 2) = 10 cm from the point P. The angle between the position vector r and the differential length vector dl is 90 degrees. Therefore, the magnetic field due to the top segment is:\n\ndB_top = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 A * 0.2 m) / (0.1 m)² * sin(90°) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 0.2 m) / 0.01 m² = 8π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the bottom segment is the same, the total magnetic field due to the top and bottom segments is:\n\nB_top_bottom = 2 * dB_top = 16π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field due to the left segment. The length of this segment is 10 cm, and it is at a distance of 5 cm from the point P. The angle between the position vector r and the differential length vector dl is 90 degrees. Therefore, the magnetic field due to the left segment is:\n\ndB_left = (μ₀ / 4π) * (2 A * 0.1 m) / (0.05 m)² * sin(90°) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 0.1 m) / 0.0025 m² = 16π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to the right segment is the same, the total magnetic field due to the left and right segments is:\n\nB_left_right = 2 * dB_left = 32π × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nFinally, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to all four segments to find the total magnetic field at the point P:\n\nB_total = B_top_bottom + B_left_right = 16π × 10⁻⁶ T + 32π × 10⁻⁶ T = 48π × 10⁻⁶ T ≈ 150.8 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 5 cm away from the center of the loop is approximately 150.8 μT."
