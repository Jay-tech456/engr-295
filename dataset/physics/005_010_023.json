According to the observer on the spaceship, what angle does the beam of light appear to be coming from? Use the formula for relativistic aberration of light to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "The formula for relativistic aberration of light is given by:\n\ntan(θ') = sin(θ) / (γ(cos(θ) + β))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the direction of the light and the direction of the spaceship's motion in the rest frame (in this case, 0 degrees, since they are moving directly towards each other), θ' is the angle observed in the spaceship's frame, β is the ratio of the spaceship's velocity to the speed of light (0.8 in this case), and γ is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.8^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, we can use the formula for relativistic aberration of light to find the angle θ':\n\ntan(θ') = sin(0) / (1.67(cos(0) + 0.8))\ntan(θ') = 0 / (1.67(1 + 0.8))\ntan(θ') = 0 / (1.67 * 1.8)\n\nSince the numerator is 0, the tangent of the angle θ' is also 0. Therefore, θ' = 0 degrees.\n\nSo, according to the observer on the spaceship, the beam of light appears to be coming directly from the star, at an angle of 0 degrees."
