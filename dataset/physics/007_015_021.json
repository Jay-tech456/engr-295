    "message_2": "The nuclear force, also known as the strong nuclear force or the strong force, is one of the four fundamental forces in nature. It is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus. The range of nuclear forces is quite short, typically around 1 to 3 femtometers (1 femtometer = 10^-15 meters).\n\nThe short range of the nuclear force has significant implications for the stability of atomic nuclei. Since the nuclear force is attractive and acts only over short distances, it is effective in binding protons and neutrons together in small nuclei. However, as the size of the nucleus increases, the nuclear force becomes less effective in providing stability.\n\nIn larger nuclei, the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons starts to play a more significant role. This repulsion can cause instability in the nucleus, as the protons are pushed away from each other. The balance between the attractive nuclear force and the repulsive electrostatic force determines the stability of the nucleus.\n\nFor atomic nuclei with a low number of protons and neutrons, the strong nuclear force is sufficient to overcome the electrostatic repulsion, resulting in stable nuclei. However, as the number of protons and neutrons increases, the balance shifts, and the electrostatic repulsion becomes more dominant. This leads to a greater likelihood of the nucleus undergoing radioactive decay or fission to reach a more stable state.\n\nIn summary, the range of nuclear forces is short, around 1 to 3 femtometers, and it plays a crucial role in determining the stability of atomic nuclei. The balance between the attractive nuclear force and the repulsive electrostatic force governs the stability of the nucleus, with larger nuclei being more prone to instability due to the increasing influence of electrostatic repulsion."
