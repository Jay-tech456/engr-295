    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the problem states that the sphere carries a steady current, we need to clarify how the current is distributed on the sphere. \n\nAssuming that the current is uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere, we can treat the sphere as a collection of infinitesimally small current loops. The magnetic field at a point outside the sphere due to each loop can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law and then integrated over the entire sphere.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nHowever, solving this problem using the Biot-Savart law and integrating over the entire sphere is quite complex. Instead, we can use the fact that a uniformly distributed current on the surface of a sphere creates a magnetic field that is equivalent to that of a magnetic dipole at the center of the sphere.\n\nThe magnetic field B due to a magnetic dipole with a magnetic moment m at a distance r from the dipole is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (1 / r^3) * (3(m · r)r - m)\n\nwhere r is the position vector from the dipole to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to find the magnetic moment m of the sphere. The magnetic moment is given by the product of the current I and the area A of the current loop:\n\nm = I * A\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere, the magnetic moment of the entire sphere can be found by integrating the magnetic moment of each infinitesimal current loop over the entire surface. However, due to symmetry, the magnetic moment of the sphere will be zero. This is because the magnetic moment of each infinitesimal current loop will be canceled out by the magnetic moment of another current loop on the opposite side of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point 10 cm away from the center of the sphere is zero."
