    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula, which relates the observed frequency (f_obs) to the emitted frequency (f_em) of light from a moving source:\n\nf_obs = f_em * sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the star relative to the observer (0.8c) and c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, let's convert the emitted wavelength to frequency using the formula:\n\nf_em = c / λ_em\n\nwhere λ_em is the emitted wavelength (600 nm).\n\nWe need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ_em = 600 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.00 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can find the emitted frequency:\n\nf_em = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.00 x 10^-7 m) = 5.00 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNext, we can use the relativistic Doppler effect formula to find the observed frequency:\n\nf_obs = (5.00 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\nf_obs = (5.00 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\nf_obs = (5.00 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(1 / 9)\nf_obs = (5.00 x 10^14 Hz) * (1 / 3)\n\nf_obs = 1.67 x 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the light as measured by an observer on Earth is approximately 1.67 x 10^14 Hz."
