    "message_2": "The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system are affected by the distance between the two neutron stars, their masses, and the distance between the system and the observer (Earth).\n\n1. Frequency: The frequency of the gravitational waves is primarily determined by the orbital period of the binary system. As the two neutron stars orbit each other, they lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves, causing their orbit to shrink and their orbital period to decrease. The frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency, given by:\n\nf = 2 * (1 / P)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves and P is the orbital period.\n\n2. Amplitude: The amplitude of the gravitational waves is determined by the masses of the neutron stars, their distance from each other, and the distance between the system and the observer. The amplitude of the gravitational waves is given by:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * a) / (c^2 * r)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the binary system (sum of the masses of the two neutron stars), a is the separation between the neutron stars, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance between the binary system and the observer.\n\nAs the distance between the neutron stars decreases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves increases. However, as the distance between the binary system and the observer increases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases.\n\nIn summary, the frequency of the gravitational waves is primarily determined by the orbital period of the binary neutron star system, while the amplitude is affected by the masses of the neutron stars, their distance from each other, and the distance between the system and the observer. The mathematical relationships between these variables are given by the equations above."
