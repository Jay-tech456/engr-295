    "message_2": "To find the power of the lens, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nGiven the values:\nf = 20 cm\nn = 1.5\nR1 = 30 cm\nR2 = -25 cm (negative because it's on the opposite side of the lens)\n\nPlugging these values into the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/20 = (1.5 - 1) * (1/30 - 1/-25)\n\n1/20 = 0.5 * (1/30 + 1/25)\n\n1/20 = 0.5 * (55/750)\n\n1/20 = 0.5 * (11/150)\n\n20 = 1 / (0.5 * 11/150)\n\n20 = 1 / (11/300)\n\n20 = 300/11\n\nNow, the power of the lens (P) is the inverse of the focal length (f):\n\nP = 1/f\n\nP = 11/300\n\nThe power of the lens is 11/300 diopters, or approximately 0.0367 diopters."
