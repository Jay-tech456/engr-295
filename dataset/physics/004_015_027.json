    "message_2": "General Relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, is a theory of gravitation that describes the gravitational force as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This theory has been successful in explaining various phenomena in the universe, including the discrepancy between visible matter in galaxy clusters and their observed gravitational effects, which provides evidence for the existence of Dark Matter.\n\nGalaxy clusters are large structures in the universe, consisting of hundreds or thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. Observations of galaxy clusters have shown that the visible matter (stars, gas, and dust) is not sufficient to account for the observed gravitational effects, such as the motion of galaxies within the cluster and the bending of light (gravitational lensing) around the cluster.\n\nAccording to General Relativity, the presence of mass and energy curves spacetime, and this curvature determines the motion of objects in the vicinity. In the case of galaxy clusters, the observed motion of galaxies and the gravitational lensing effects indicate that there must be more mass present than what is visible. This discrepancy can be explained by the existence of Dark Matter, a form of matter that does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes.\n\nDark Matter is believed to make up around 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while visible matter (also known as baryonic matter) accounts for only about 5%. The rest is made up of Dark Energy, a mysterious form of energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support the existence of Dark Matter, including:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation of galaxies show that their outer regions rotate faster than what would be expected based on the visible matter alone. This can be explained by the presence of a Dark Matter halo surrounding the galaxy, providing additional gravitational force.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light around massive objects, as predicted by General Relativity, has been observed in galaxy clusters. The amount of lensing observed is greater than what would be expected based on the visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of Dark Matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. Measurements of the CMB show fluctuations in temperature that are consistent with the presence of Dark Matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Simulations of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments, require the presence of Dark Matter to match the observed distribution of galaxies.\n\nIn conclusion, General Relativity's predictions, along with various observational evidence, strongly suggest the existence of Dark Matter to explain the discrepancy between visible matter in galaxy clusters and their observed gravitational effects. While the exact nature of Dark Matter is still unknown, ongoing research and experiments aim to uncover its properties and deepen our understanding of this mysterious component of the universe."
