    "message_1": "What is the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the neutron star merger that occurred in 2017, known as GW170817?",
    "message_2": "The gravitational wave event GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in 2017. According to the LIGO and Virgo collaborations, the frequency of the gravitational waves increased from about 24 Hz to around 2040 Hz over a period of approximately 100 seconds as the neutron stars spiraled towards each other.\n\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves is characterized by the dimensionless strain parameter, denoted as \"h.\" For GW170817, the peak strain amplitude was estimated to be around 1.0 x 10^-22. This value represents the maximum stretching and squeezing of spacetime caused by the gravitational waves as they passed through the Earth.\n\nIt is important to note that these values are based on the observations and analysis of the LIGO and Virgo detectors, and they may be subject to refinements as more data and improved analysis techniques become available."
