    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the cross-section for electron-positron annihilation to produce two photons at leading order can be calculated using the Feynman diagrams and the rules of quantum electrodynamics (QED). At leading order, there is only one Feynman diagram contributing to this process, which involves the exchange of a virtual photon between the electron and positron.\n\nThe cross-section for this process can be expressed in terms of the Mandelstam variables s, t, and u, which are related to the energy and momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles. The differential cross-section for this process is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / 8πs) * [(s^2 + u^2) / t^2]\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately equal to 1/137), Ω is the solid angle, and s, t, and u are the Mandelstam variables.\n\nTo obtain the total cross-section, we need to integrate the differential cross-section over the full solid angle:\n\nσ = ∫ dσ/dΩ dΩ\n\nAfter performing the integration, the total cross-section for electron-positron annihilation to produce two photons at leading order in QED is given by:\n\nσ = (πα^2 / 2s) * (1 - 4m_e^2 / s) * (1 + 2m_e^2 / s)\n\nwhere m_e is the electron mass, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy."
