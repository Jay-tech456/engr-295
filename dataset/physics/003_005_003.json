    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field around a long straight wire carrying a current, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nIn this case, the current (I) is 5 A, and the distance (r) is 10 cm, which is equal to 0.1 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field 10 cm away from the wire is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla).\n\nTo find the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in a circular pattern around the wire, with the direction depending on the perspective from which you are looking at the wire."
