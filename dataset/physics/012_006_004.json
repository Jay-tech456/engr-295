    "message_2": "Specific impulse (Isp) is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine, and it is defined as the thrust produced per unit mass flow rate of propellant. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nIsp = Ve / g0\n\nwhere Ve is the exhaust velocity and g0 is the standard acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nGiven the exhaust velocity (Ve) of 50,000 m/s, we can calculate the specific impulse:\n\nIsp = 50,000 m/s / 9.81 m/s² ≈ 5096.84 s\n\nNow, let's find out how long it will take the thruster to consume 1 kg of propellant. The thruster consumes 1 mg (0.001 g) of propellant per second. To convert 1 kg to grams:\n\n1 kg = 1000 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it takes to consume 1 kg of propellant:\n\ntime = (1000 g) / (0.001 g/s) = 1,000,000 s\n\nSo, it will take the plasma thruster 1,000,000 seconds to consume 1 kg of propellant."
