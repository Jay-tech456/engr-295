    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and third bright fringes, we can use the formula for the angular position of bright fringes in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (2n + 1) * (λ / 2a)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the bright fringe, n is the order of the fringe (0 for the central maximum, 1 for the first bright fringe, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular position of the first bright fringe (n = 1):\n\nθ1 = (2 * 1 + 1) * (500 * 10^(-9) m / 2 * 0.1 * 10^(-3) m)\nθ1 = 3 * (500 * 10^(-9) m / 0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\nθ1 ≈ 0.0075 radians\n\nNext, we need to find the angular position of the third bright fringe (n = 3):\n\nθ3 = (2 * 3 + 1) * (500 * 10^(-9) m / 2 * 0.1 * 10^(-3) m)\nθ3 = 7 * (500 * 10^(-9) m / 0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\nθ3 ≈ 0.0175 radians\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the first and third bright fringes on the screen using the small angle approximation:\n\nΔy = L * (θ3 - θ1)\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between the fringes and L is the distance from the slit to the screen.\n\nΔy = 2 m * (0.0175 - 0.0075)\nΔy = 2 m * 0.01\nΔy = 0.02 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and third bright fringes on the screen is 0.02 meters or 2 centimeters."
