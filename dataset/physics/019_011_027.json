    "message_2": "Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a powerful framework in quantum field theory (QFT) that allows us to describe the low-energy behavior of a physical system without the need to know the details of the underlying high-energy physics. EFT is based on the idea of integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom, which are irrelevant at low energies, and retaining only the light degrees of freedom that are relevant for the phenomena we are interested in.\n\nTo calculate the effective field theory, we follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant degrees of freedom: Determine the light fields that are relevant at the energy scale of interest. These fields will be the building blocks of the EFT.\n\n2. Write down the most general Lagrangian: Construct the most general Lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory, involving only the light degrees of freedom. This Lagrangian will contain an infinite number of terms, ordered by their mass dimension.\n\n3. Organize the terms in a systematic expansion: Since we are interested in low-energy phenomena, we can organize the terms in the Lagrangian in a systematic expansion in powers of energy (E) over the high-energy scale (Λ). This is called the E/Λ expansion. The leading terms in this expansion will give the dominant contributions to the low-energy observables, while the higher-order terms will provide smaller corrections.\n\n4. Match the coefficients: To determine the coefficients of the various terms in the EFT Lagrangian, we need to match the low-energy observables calculated in the EFT with the corresponding observables in the underlying high-energy theory. This is usually done perturbatively, by comparing the two theories order by order in the E/Λ expansion.\n\n5. Renormalization: Just like in any QFT, the EFT will generally require renormalization to absorb the divergences that arise in loop calculations. The renormalization procedure introduces a set of renormalization constants, which depend on the renormalization scale (μ). The dependence of the EFT observables on μ should cancel out when all orders in the E/Λ expansion are included, but in practice, we only work up to a finite order, so there will be some residual scale dependence.\n\nPractical applications of EFT:\n\n1. Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT): ChPT is an EFT that describes the low-energy interactions of pions, kaons, and eta mesons in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It is based on the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD and provides a systematic expansion in powers of the meson momenta and masses.\n\n2. Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET): HQET is an EFT that simplifies the description of heavy quark systems, such as the bottom and charm quarks, by exploiting the fact that their masses are much larger than the typical energy scale of strong interactions. HQET has been used to calculate various properties of heavy mesons and baryons, as well as to study the heavy quark expansion in QCD.\n\n3. Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD): NRQCD is an EFT that describes the bound states of heavy quarks, such as the quarkonium system, in a non-relativistic framework. NRQCD provides a systematic expansion in powers of the heavy quark velocity (v) and has been used to calculate various properties of quarkonium states, such as their masses, decay widths, and production rates.\n\n4. Gravitational EFT: Gravitational EFT is an EFT that describes the low-energy dynamics of gravity in the context of General Relativity. It provides a systematic expansion in powers of the curvature and has been used to study various aspects of gravitational physics, such as the post-Newtonian expansion in the solar system and the gravitational wave emission from binary systems.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many applications of EFT in different areas of physics. The power of EFT lies in its ability to provide a systematic and controlled approximation to the low-energy behavior of a physical system, without the need to know the details of the underlying high-energy physics."
