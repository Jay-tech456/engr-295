    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm (focal length)\nu = 30 cm (object distance)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(2 + 1)/30 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 30/(2 + 1)\nv = 30/3\nv = 10 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 10 cm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = -10/30\nM = -1/3\n\nThe magnification of the image formed is -1/3, which means the image is inverted and 1/3 the size of the object."
