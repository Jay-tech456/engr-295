    "message_1": "What is the half-life of a radioactive substance that has decayed to 25% of its original amount after 40 minutes, if its initial amount was 800 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of a radioactive substance, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the substance at time t, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time elapsed, T is the half-life, and the exponent represents the number of half-lives that have occurred.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the substance has decayed to 25% of its original amount after 40 minutes. This means that N(t) = 0.25 * N0. We are also given that the initial amount, N0, is 800 grams. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the half-life, T:\n\n0.25 * 800 = 800 * (1/2)^(40/T)\n\n200 = 800 * (1/2)^(40/T)\n\nDivide both sides by 800:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(40/T)\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for T. We'll use the base-2 logarithm (log2) since it will simplify the equation:\n\nlog2(0.25) = log2((1/2)^(40/T))\n\n-2 = 40/T\n\nNow, multiply both sides by T and divide by -2:\n\nT = 40 / -2\n\nT = -20\n\nHowever, a negative half-life doesn't make physical sense. This is because we made an error when taking the logarithm. The correct equation should be:\n\nlog2(4) = 40/T\n\n2 = 40/T\n\nNow, multiply both sides by T and divide by 2:\n\nT = 40 / 2\n\nT = 20\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive substance is 20 minutes."
