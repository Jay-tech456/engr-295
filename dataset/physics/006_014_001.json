    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of the 2p state of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the spontaneous emission rate (A) and then find the lifetime (τ) as the inverse of the emission rate. The formula for the spontaneous emission rate is:\n\nA = (64π^4 * e^2 * f^3) / (3h * c^3)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C), h is the Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the photon using the given wavelength (λ):\n\nf = c / λ\n\nλ = 121.6 nm = 121.6 x 10^-9 m\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (121.6 x 10^-9 m) = 2.47 x 10^15 Hz\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for the spontaneous emission rate (A):\n\nA = (64π^4 * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * (2.47 x 10^15 Hz)^3) / (3 * (6.63 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3)\nA ≈ 4.7 x 10^8 s^-1\n\nFinally, we can find the lifetime (τ) as the inverse of the emission rate:\n\nτ = 1 / A\nτ ≈ 1 / (4.7 x 10^8 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 2.1 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the 2p state of a hydrogen atom that has been excited by absorbing a photon of wavelength 121.6 nm is approximately 2.1 nanoseconds."
