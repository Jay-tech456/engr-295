    "message_2": "To calculate the fugacity of propane gas, we will use the van der Waals equation of state, which accounts for the real gas behavior. The equation is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)²)(V - nb) = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are the van der Waals constants.\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of a and b for propane gas. We are given the molar attraction constant a = 0.00420 Pa·m³/mol². The molar volume constant b can be estimated using the critical properties of propane:\n\nTc = 369.8 K (critical temperature)\nPc = 42.5 atm (critical pressure)\n\nWe can use the following relationships to find b:\n\nb = RTc / (8 * Pc)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the critical pressure from atm to Pa:\n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\nPc = 42.5 * 101325 Pa = 4303812.5 Pa\n\nNow, we can find b:\n\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K)\nb = (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 369.8 K) / (8 * 4303812.5 Pa)\nb = 0.0000429 m³/mol\n\nNow, we can use the van der Waals equation to find the fugacity of propane gas. The fugacity is defined as the effective pressure of a real gas, which can be found by multiplying the actual pressure by a fugacity coefficient (Φ):\n\nfugacity = Φ * P\n\nThe fugacity coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΦ = exp[(P - P_ideal) * V / (RT)]\n\nwhere P_ideal is the ideal gas pressure, which can be found using the ideal gas law:\n\nP_ideal = nRT / V\n\nNow, we can find P_ideal:\n\nP_ideal = (1 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K) / 0.1 m³\nP_ideal = 2494.2 Pa\n\nNext, we need to find the real pressure P using the van der Waals equation:\n\n(1 atm + a(1 mol / 0.1 m³)²)(0.1 m³ - 1 mol * b) = 1 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K\n\nConvert 1 atm to Pa:\n\nP = 101325 Pa\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\n(101325 Pa + 0.00420 Pa·m³/mol² * (1 mol / 0.1 m³)²)(0.1 m³ - 1 mol * 0.0000429 m³/mol) = 1 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K\n\n(101325 Pa + 0.168 Pa)(0.1 m³ - 0.0000429 m³) = 2494.2 J\n\n(101493.168 Pa)(0.0999571 m³) = 2494.2 J\n\nP = 101493.168 Pa\n\nNow, we can find the fugacity coefficient:\n\nΦ = exp[(101493.168 Pa - 2494.2 Pa) * 0.1 m³ / (1 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K)]\n\nΦ = exp[(99098.968 Pa) * 0.1 m³ / (2494.2 J)]\n\nΦ = exp[3.975]\n\nΦ = 53.23\n\nFinally, we can find the fugacity of propane gas:\n\nfugacity = Φ * P\nfugacity = 53.23 * 101325 Pa\nfugacity = 5392997.75 Pa\n\nThe fugacity of propane gas in the given conditions is approximately 5.39 x 10^6 Pa."
