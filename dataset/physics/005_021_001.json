    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for the wavelength of light. The formula is:\n\nλ' = λ * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere λ' is the observed wavelength, λ is the wavelength in the rest frame of the light source, β is the relative velocity between the observer and the light source (in units of c, the speed of light), and sqrt denotes the square root.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the beam of light travels at a speed of 0.8c in a vacuum. However, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, so there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Assuming the light is traveling at c, we can proceed with the given observer's speed of 0.6c.\n\nSo, β = 0.6.\n\nWe are not given the rest frame wavelength (λ), but we can solve the problem in terms of λ:\n\nλ' = λ * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\nλ' = λ * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\nλ' = λ * sqrt(4)\nλ' = 2λ\n\nThe observed wavelength (λ') is twice the rest frame wavelength (λ) for an observer moving towards the light at a speed of 0.6c."
