    "message_2": "To calculate the decay rate (Γ) of a scalar particle with a mass of 3 GeV decaying into two photons in a quantum field theory model with an electromagnetic interaction coupling strength (α) of 0.1, we can use the following formula:\n\nΓ = (α^2 * m^3) / (64 * π)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the scalar particle and π is the mathematical constant pi.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΓ = (0.1^2 * (3 GeV)^3) / (64 * π)\n\nΓ ≈ 0.0003375 GeV\n\nThe decay rate of the scalar particle is approximately 0.0003375 GeV.\n\nTo calculate the branching ratio for this decay, we need to know the total decay rate (Γ_total) of the scalar particle into all possible final states. However, since we do not have information about other decay channels, we cannot calculate the branching ratio directly. If more information about other decay channels is provided, the branching ratio can be calculated as:\n\nBranching ratio = Γ / Γ_total"
