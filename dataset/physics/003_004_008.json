    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nR = 0.2 meters\nI = 5.0 A\nx = 0.15 meters\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5.0 A * (0.2 m)²) / (2 * ((0.2 m)² + (0.15 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the values inside the parentheses:\n\n(0.2 m)² = 0.04 m²\n(0.15 m)² = 0.0225 m²\n\nNow, we can add these values:\n\n0.04 m² + 0.0225 m² = 0.0625 m²\n\nNext, we'll raise this sum to the power of 3/2:\n\n(0.0625 m²)^(3/2) = 0.015625 m^(3)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5.0 A * 0.04 m²) / (2 * 0.015625 m^(3))\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5.0 A * 0.04 m² ≈ 2.513 × 10^(-6) Tm²\n\nAnd now, we can calculate the denominator:\n\n2 * 0.015625 m^(3) = 0.03125 m^(3)\n\nFinally, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\nB ≈ (2.513 × 10^(-6) Tm²) / (0.03125 m^(3))\n\nB ≈ 8.04 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis at a distance of 0.15 meters from the center of the circular loop is approximately 8.04 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
