    "message_2": "Extracting energy from a black hole's accretion disc is theoretically possible, but there are several limitations and challenges that make it currently infeasible with our existing technologies.\n\n1. Distance: The nearest known black hole is about 1,000 light-years away from Earth. With our current propulsion technology, it would take tens of thousands of years to reach such a distance. We would need to develop much faster propulsion systems to make this journey feasible.\n\n2. Extreme environment: The environment around a black hole is extremely hostile, with intense radiation, strong magnetic fields, and extreme gravitational forces. These conditions would pose significant challenges to any spacecraft or equipment attempting to extract energy from the accretion disc.\n\n3. Energy extraction methods: One proposed method for extracting energy from a black hole's accretion disc is the Penrose process, which involves exploiting the rotational energy of the black hole. However, this process requires precise manipulation of matter and energy in the vicinity of the black hole, which is beyond our current technological capabilities.\n\n4. Energy transmission: Even if we could extract energy from a black hole's accretion disc, transmitting that energy back to Earth would be another significant challenge. We would need to develop efficient and reliable methods for transmitting energy across vast distances in space.\n\n5. Cost and resources: The development of technologies and infrastructure required for such a project would likely be prohibitively expensive and resource-intensive. The cost and effort required to extract energy from a black hole's accretion disc may outweigh the potential benefits, at least with our current understanding of the process and available technologies.\n\nIn summary, while the idea of extracting energy from a black hole's accretion disc is intriguing and theoretically possible, it is currently infeasible due to the limitations of our existing technologies and the numerous challenges involved. Advances in propulsion, materials science, energy extraction, and transmission methods would be necessary before such a project could become a reality."
