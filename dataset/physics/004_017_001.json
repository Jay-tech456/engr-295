    "message_2": "To calculate the deflection angle of light passing near a massive object according to the theory of General Relativity and the gravitational lensing effect, we can use the following formula:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere:\n- α is the deflection angle\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the massive object (in kg)\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\n- b is the distance of closest approach, or the impact parameter (in meters), which is the distance between the light ray and the massive object at their closest point\n\nGiven the mass of the massive object (M) and the distance from the observer (b), you can plug these values into the formula to find the predicted deflection angle of the light. Note that this formula assumes that the deflection angle is small, which is generally true for most astrophysical situations."
