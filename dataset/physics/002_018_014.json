    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the ideal gas law, which is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the initial pressure (P1) and the final pressure (P2), as well as the change in temperature (ΔT). We need to find the Boyle temperature, which is the temperature at which the gas obeys Boyle's law (PV = constant). \n\nFirst, let's convert the given change in temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nΔT = 25°C = 25 K (since the difference of 1°C is equal to 1 K)\n\nNow, let's assume that the initial temperature is T1 and the final temperature is T2. Since we know the change in temperature, we can write:\n\nT2 = T1 + ΔT\n\nSince the gas obeys the ideal gas law, we can write the equation for the initial and final states:\n\nP1V1 = nRT1\nP2V2 = nRT2\n\nWe are looking for the Boyle temperature, which means that the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Therefore, we can write:\n\nV1 = k/P1\nV2 = k/P2\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nNow, let's substitute the expressions for V1 and V2 into the ideal gas law equations:\n\nP1(k/P1) = nRT1\nP2(k/P2) = nRT2\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\nk = nRT1/P1\nk = nRT2/P2\n\nNow, let's set the two expressions for k equal to each other:\n\nnRT1/P1 = nRT2/P2\n\nSince n and R are constants, we can cancel them out:\n\nT1/P1 = T2/P2\n\nNow, let's substitute T2 with T1 + ΔT:\n\nT1/P1 = (T1 + ΔT)/P2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for P1, P2, and ΔT:\n\nT1/2 atm = (T1 + 25 K)/4 atm\n\nTo solve for T1, we can first cross-multiply:\n\n4 atm * T1 = 2 atm * (T1 + 25 K)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4T1 = 2T1 + 50 K\n\nNow, let's solve for T1:\n\n2T1 = 50 K\nT1 = 25 K\n\nNow that we have the initial temperature, we can find the final temperature (T2) using the equation:\n\nT2 = T1 + ΔT\nT2 = 25 K + 25 K\nT2 = 50 K\n\nThe Boyle temperature is the temperature at which the gas obeys Boyle's law, which is the initial temperature T1 in this case. Therefore, the Boyle temperature of the gas is 25 K."
