    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of a copper nanowire, we can use the following formula:\n\nk = (1/3) * C * v * L\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, C is the specific heat capacity, v is the average phonon velocity, and L is the mean free path of phonons.\n\nFor copper, the specific heat capacity (C) is approximately 385 J/(kg·K), and the average phonon velocity (v) is about 4.2 x 10^3 m/s. \n\nTo calculate the mean free path (L) of phonons, we can use the formula:\n\nL = D * λ\n\nwhere D is the diameter of the nanowire and λ is the phonon mean free path in bulk copper. The phonon mean free path in bulk copper (λ) is approximately 40 nm.\n\nGiven the diameter (D) of the copper nanowire is 50 nm, we can calculate the mean free path (L) as follows:\n\nL = 50 nm * 40 nm = 2000 nm^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal conductivity (k) using the formula mentioned earlier:\n\nk = (1/3) * C * v * L\nk = (1/3) * 385 J/(kg·K) * 4.2 x 10^3 m/s * 2000 x 10^-9 m\n\nk ≈ 0.36 W/(m·K)\n\nThus, the thermal conductivity of the copper nanowire with a diameter of 50 nm and a length of 1 micron is approximately 0.36 W/(m·K), assuming that the phonon transport dominates and the boundary scattering effects are negligible."
