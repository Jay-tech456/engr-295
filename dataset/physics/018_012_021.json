    "message_2": "Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes used in high-energy gamma-ray astronomy typically detect gamma rays in the energy range of about 30 GeV (giga-electron volts) to 100 TeV (tera-electron volts). This energy range is significantly higher than the energy range of gamma rays detected by space-based observatories, which usually cover the range from a few keV (kilo-electron volts) to a few GeV.\n\nCherenkov telescopes are able to detect such high-energy gamma rays through a phenomenon called Cherenkov radiation. When a high-energy gamma ray enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the atmospheric molecules and produces an electron-positron pair. These charged particles then generate a cascade of secondary particles, known as an extensive air shower, as they interact with other atmospheric molecules.\n\nAs the charged particles in the air shower travel faster than the speed of light in the atmosphere, they emit Cherenkov radiation, which is a faint, bluish light. This light is detected by the Cherenkov telescopes, which consist of large mirrors that collect and focus the Cherenkov light onto an array of photomultiplier tubes or other light-sensitive detectors.\n\nBy analyzing the detected Cherenkov light, researchers can determine the direction, energy, and other properties of the original gamma-ray photon. This information is crucial for studying various astrophysical phenomena, such as supernova remnants, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts, which are associated with the production of high-energy gamma rays."
