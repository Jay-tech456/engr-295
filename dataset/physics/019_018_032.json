    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) is a powerful tool to study the behavior of products of local operators at short distances. Let's consider two scalar fields, φ(x) and φ(y), at two different spacetime points x and y. The OPE of these fields can be written as:\n\nφ(x)φ(y) = ∑_i C_i(x, y) O_i(y),\n\nwhere C_i(x, y) are the coefficient functions, O_i(y) are the local operators, and the sum runs over all possible local operators in the theory.\n\nTo determine the singular behavior of the OPE, we can consider the two-point correlation function of the scalar fields:\n\n<φ(x)φ(y)> = ∑_i C_i(x, y) <O_i(y)>.\n\nIn the limit when the two points x and y approach each other (x → y), we can expect the correlation function to exhibit singular behavior. This is because the fields become highly correlated as they get closer, and the vacuum fluctuations become more significant.\n\nThe singular behavior can be analyzed by considering the short-distance behavior of the coefficient functions C_i(x, y). In general, the leading singular term in the OPE will be proportional to the inverse of the distance between the two points raised to some power:\n\nC_i(x, y) ~ 1/|x - y|^(2Δ_i),\n\nwhere Δ_i is the scaling dimension of the operator O_i(y).\n\nThe result of the OPE will be singular if there exists at least one operator O_i(y) with a non-zero vacuum expectation value <O_i(y)> and a non-negative scaling dimension Δ_i. In this case, the two-point correlation function will diverge as x approaches y:\n\n<φ(x)φ(y)> ~ 1/|x - y|^(2Δ_i).\n\nIn conclusion, the operator product expansion of two scalar fields in quantum field theory at two different points can exhibit singular behavior when the points approach each other. The singularity depends on the existence of operators with non-zero vacuum expectation values and non-negative scaling dimensions in the OPE."
