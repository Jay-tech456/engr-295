    "message_2": "To calculate the boundary layer thickness, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^0.5\n\nwhere x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate (in this case, 5 cm or 0.05 m), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and U is the free-stream velocity of the fluid (5 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν) of the fluid. We can do this using the formula:\n\nν = μ / ρ\n\nwhere μ is the dynamic viscosity (0.01 Pa·s) and ρ is the density of the fluid. Since the density of the fluid is not given, we will assume it to be the density of water at room temperature, which is approximately 1000 kg/m³.\n\nν = 0.01 Pa·s / 1000 kg/m³ = 1 x 10^-5 m²/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.05 m * (1 x 10^-5 m²/s / 5 m/s))^0.5\nδ = (5 * 0.05 m * (1 x 10^-5 m²/s))^0.5\nδ = (2.5 x 10^-4 m²)^0.5\nδ ≈ 0.0158 m\n\nSo, the boundary layer thickness at a distance of 5 cm from the leading edge of the plate is approximately 0.0158 meters or 15.8 mm."
