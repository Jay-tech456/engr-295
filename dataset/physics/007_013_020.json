    "message_2": "In stars, nuclear fusion occurs when protons (hydrogen nuclei) come close enough to each other to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them, allowing the strong nuclear force to bind them together. This process is called proton-proton fusion, and it is the primary mechanism by which stars like our Sun generate energy.\n\nThe minimum temperature required for this process to occur is determined by the concept of thermal energy, which is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system. The temperature must be high enough for the protons to have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them.\n\nIn stars, the minimum temperature required for proton-proton fusion is approximately 4 million Kelvin (4 x 10^6 K). At this temperature, the protons have enough kinetic energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over, leading to the formation of a stable nuclear object (in this case, a deuteron, which consists of one proton and one neutron). This fusion process also releases energy in the form of gamma-ray photons and neutrinos."
