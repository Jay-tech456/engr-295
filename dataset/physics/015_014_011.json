    "message_2": "To estimate the expected frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted from a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between 10 and 100 solar masses located within a range of 200-300 megaparsecs from Earth, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Estimate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a pair of PBHs.\n2. Estimate the amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a pair of PBHs.\n3. Consider the detectability of these waves with changes in their parameters.\n\n1. Estimating the frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a pair of PBHs in a circular orbit can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/96 * (pi * G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)^(5/8))\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two PBHs, and r is the separation between them.\n\nAssuming the PBHs have masses between 10 and 100 solar masses, we can estimate the frequency range by considering the minimum and maximum mass combinations. For simplicity, we will assume equal mass PBHs (M1 = M2) and a separation of 10 times their Schwarzschild radius (r = 20 * G * M / c^2).\n\nFor M1 = M2 = 10 solar masses, the frequency is approximately 1.5 x 10^2 Hz.\nFor M1 = M2 = 100 solar masses, the frequency is approximately 1.5 x 10^1 Hz.\n\n2. Estimating the amplitude of gravitational waves:\n\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a pair of PBHs can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M1 * M2 / (c^4 * d)) * (G * (M1 + M2) / (c^2 * r))^(1/2)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational waves, d is the distance from the PBHs to Earth, and the other variables are as defined previously.\n\nAssuming the PBHs are located within a range of 200-300 megaparsecs from Earth, we can estimate the amplitude range by considering the minimum and maximum mass combinations and distances. For simplicity, we will assume equal mass PBHs (M1 = M2) and a separation of 10 times their Schwarzschild radius (r = 20 * G * M / c^2).\n\nFor M1 = M2 = 10 solar masses and d = 200 Mpc, the amplitude is approximately 3.0 x 10^-23.\nFor M1 = M2 = 100 solar masses and d = 300 Mpc, the amplitude is approximately 1.3 x 10^-22.\n\n3. Detectability of gravitational waves:\n\nThe detectability of gravitational waves depends on the sensitivity of the detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, which are sensitive to frequencies between 10 Hz and several kHz. The estimated frequency range of 1.5 x 10^1 Hz to 1.5 x 10^2 Hz falls within the sensitivity range of these detectors.\n\nHowever, the amplitude of the gravitational waves is quite small, making their detection challenging. The detectability of these waves would improve with increased sensitivity of the detectors, closer distances to the PBHs, or larger masses of the PBHs.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted from a population of primordial black holes with masses between 10 and 100 solar masses located within a range of 200-300 megaparsecs from Earth is between 1.5 x 10^1 Hz and 1.5 x 10^2 Hz, and the expected amplitude is between 3.0 x 10^-23 and 1.3 x 10^-22. The detectability of these waves would vary with changes in the parameters, such as the sensitivity of the detectors, the distance to the PBHs, and the masses of the PBHs."
