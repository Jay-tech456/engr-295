    "message_2": "To calculate the expected angle of deflection for alpha particles incident on a gold foil, we can use Rutherford's scattering formula. The formula is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (k * Z₁ * Z₂ * e^4) / (16 * π * E₀^2 * b^4 * sin^4(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- dσ/dΩ is the differential cross-section\n- k is the Coulomb constant (8.9875517923 × 10^9 N m² C⁻²)\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the two interacting particles (Z₁ = 2 for alpha particles, Z₂ = 79 for gold)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602176634 × 10^(-19) C)\n- E₀ is the initial energy of the alpha particles (5.5 MeV = 5.5 × 10^6 eV)\n- b is the impact parameter\n- θ is the scattering angle\n\nHowever, this formula gives the differential cross-section, not the angle of deflection itself. To find the angle of deflection, we need to consider the specific experimental setup and the distribution of impact parameters. In practice, the angle of deflection will depend on the specific trajectory of each alpha particle and the distribution of gold atoms in the foil.\n\nSince the thickness of the gold foil is given (0.001 mm), we can estimate the range of possible angles of deflection by considering the minimum and maximum impact parameters. However, this would require additional information about the experimental setup, such as the distance between the alpha particle source and the gold foil, and the distance between the gold foil and the detector.\n\nIn summary, Rutherford's scattering formula can help us understand the relationship between the angle of deflection and other parameters, but it does not directly provide the expected angle of deflection for a specific experimental setup. To find the expected angle of deflection, we would need more information about the distribution of impact parameters and the geometry of the experiment."
