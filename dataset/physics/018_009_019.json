    "message_2": "The thermodynamic properties of black holes, such as entropy and temperature, are closely related to their mass and angular momentum. In this explanation, we will first discuss the case of a non-rotating black hole (Schwarzschild black hole) and then move on to the case of a rotating black hole (Kerr black hole).\n\n1. Non-rotating black hole (Schwarzschild black hole):\n\nA Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by its mass (M) and has no angular momentum (J = 0). The event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is a sphere with radius Rs, known as the Schwarzschild radius, given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.\n\na) Entropy: The entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:\n\nS = kA/4ħG\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The surface area of the event horizon is given by:\n\nA = 4πRs^2\n\nSince the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is directly proportional to the square of its mass.\n\nb) Temperature: The temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole is given by the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = ħc^3 / (8πGMk)\n\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, its temperature decreases. This means that larger black holes are colder than smaller ones.\n\n2. Rotating black hole (Kerr black hole):\n\nA Kerr black hole is characterized by its mass (M) and angular momentum (J). The event horizon of a Kerr black hole is an oblate spheroid, and its radius depends on both the mass and angular momentum.\n\na) Entropy: The entropy of a Kerr black hole is still given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:\n\nS = kA/4ħG\n\nHowever, the surface area of the event horizon now depends on both the mass and angular momentum of the black hole. As the angular momentum increases, the surface area of the event horizon also increases, leading to an increase in entropy.\n\nb) Temperature: The temperature of a Kerr black hole is given by a modified version of the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = ħc^3 / (8πGMk(1 + sqrt(1 - (J/GM^2)^2)))\n\nThe temperature of a Kerr black hole depends on both its mass and angular momentum. As the angular momentum increases, the temperature of the black hole decreases. This means that rotating black holes with higher angular momentum are colder than those with lower angular momentum.\n\nIn summary, the mass and angular momentum of a black hole play a crucial role in determining its thermodynamic properties. For a non-rotating black hole, the entropy is directly proportional to the square of its mass, and its temperature decreases as its mass increases. For a rotating black hole, both mass and angular momentum affect its entropy and temperature, with higher angular momentum leading to higher entropy and lower temperature."
