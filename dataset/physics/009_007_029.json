    "message_1": "A concave lens has a focal length of -20 cm. If an object is placed 50 cm away from the lens, at what distance will the image be formed?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance at which the image will be formed, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is -20 cm and the object distance (u) is -50 cm (negative because the object is on the same side as the incoming light), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/(-50)\n\nNow, we need to solve for v:\n\n1/v = 1/(-20) + 1/(-50)\n\nTo solve this equation, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/v = (-50 + (-20)) / (20 * -50)\n1/v = (-70) / (-1000)\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to find the value of v:\n\nv = -1000 / -70\n\nv â‰ˆ 14.29 cm\n\nSo, the image will be formed approximately 14.29 cm away from the lens."
