    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a free particle is the Klein-Gordon equation, which is given by:\n\n(∂²/∂t² - ∇² + (mc/ħ)²)ψ(x, t) = 0\n\nwhere ψ(x, t) is the wave function of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nThe non-relativistic wave equation is the Schrödinger equation, which is given by:\n\niħ(∂/∂t)ψ(x, t) = (-ħ²/2m)∇²ψ(x, t) + V(x)ψ(x, t)\n\nwhere V(x) is the potential energy function.\n\nThe main difference between the two equations is that the Klein-Gordon equation is a second-order differential equation in both space and time, while the Schrödinger equation is a first-order differential equation in time and a second-order differential equation in space. The Klein-Gordon equation is relativistic, meaning it takes into account the effects of special relativity, while the Schrödinger equation is non-relativistic.\n\nThe relativistic wave equation accounts for the effects of time dilation and length contraction through the presence of the speed of light c and the mass term (mc/ħ)². Time dilation and length contraction are consequences of special relativity, which states that the laws of physics should be the same for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. In the Klein-Gordon equation, the mass term (mc/ħ)² ensures that the wave function ψ(x, t) behaves correctly under Lorentz transformations, which describe how quantities like time and space intervals change between different inertial frames.\n\nIn contrast, the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation does not account for these effects, as it is based on the classical, non-relativistic expressions for energy and momentum. As a result, the Schrödinger equation is only valid for particles moving at speeds much smaller than the speed of light, where the effects of time dilation and length contraction can be neglected."
