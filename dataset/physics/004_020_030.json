    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves, we need to use the formula for the characteristic strain amplitude (h_c) of a binary system:\n\nh_c = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2 * f^2) / (c^4 * r)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the black holes to kilograms. The mass of the Sun (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 30 * M_sun = 30 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 20 * M_sun = 20 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, let's convert the distance from the source to meters. One light-year is approximately 9.461 x 10^15 meters, so 1 billion light-years is:\n\nr = 1 billion light-years = 1 x 10^9 * (9.461 x 10^15 m) = 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s (speed of light)\nf = 50 Hz\n\nh_c = (4 * (6.674 x 10^-11)^2 * (5.967 x 10^31 kg) * (3.978 x 10^31 kg) * (50 Hz)^2) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^4 * (9.461 x 10^24 m))\n\nh_c â‰ˆ 1.16 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves at a distance of 1 billion light-years from the source is approximately 1.16 x 10^-22."
