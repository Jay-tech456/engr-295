The refrigerator removes heat from the low-temperature reservoir at a rate of 200 kJ/s. Calculate the coefficient of performance and the power input required to run the refrigerator.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) and the power input required to run the refrigerator, we can use the following formulas:\n\nCOP = Q_L / W\nW = Q_H - Q_L\n\nwhere Q_L is the heat removed from the low-temperature reservoir, Q_H is the heat rejected to the high-temperature reservoir, and W is the work input to the refrigerator.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\n\nT_L = -25째C + 273.15 = 248.15 K\nT_H = 25째C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNext, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula to find the maximum possible COP for a refrigerator operating between these two temperatures:\n\nCarnot COP = T_L / (T_H - T_L) = 248.15 K / (298.15 K - 248.15 K) = 248.15 / 50 = 4.963\n\nNow, we know that the refrigerator removes heat from the low-temperature reservoir at a rate of 200 kJ/s:\n\nQ_L = 200 kJ/s\n\nWe can use the COP formula to find the work input required to run the refrigerator:\n\nW = Q_L / COP = 200 kJ/s / 4.963 = 40.28 kJ/s\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance for the refrigerator is 4.963, and the power input required to run the refrigerator is 40.28 kJ/s."
