    "message_2": "To determine the focal length of the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nWe are given the object distance (u) as 30 cm, and we can find the image distance (v) using the magnification formula:\n\nmagnification = image height / object height = v / u\n\nWe are given the object height as 2 cm and the image height as 0.5 cm. Therefore, the magnification is:\n\nmagnification = 0.5 cm / 2 cm = 0.25\n\nNow, we can find the image distance (v):\n\nv = magnification * u = 0.25 * 30 cm = 7.5 cm\n\nNow that we have both the object distance (u) and the image distance (v), we can find the focal length (f) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v = 1/30 cm + 1/7.5 cm = (1 + 4)/30 cm = 5/30 cm\n\nNow, we can find the focal length (f):\n\nf = 1 / (5/30 cm) = 30 cm / 5 = 6 cm\n\nThe focal length of the concave mirror is 6 cm."
