    "message_2": "To find the angular position of the first minimum in a single slit diffraction pattern, we can use the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 550 nm = 550 * 10^(-9) m and the width of the slit a = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m, we can find the angular position of the first minimum (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 550 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 5.5 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, we can find the angular position θ by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ = arcsin(5.5 * 10^(-6))\n\nθ ≈ 3.14 * 10^(-3) radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor (180°/π):\n\nθ ≈ (3.14 * 10^(-3)) * (180°/π) ≈ 0.18°\n\nSo, the angular position of the first minimum in the single slit diffraction pattern is approximately 0.18°."
