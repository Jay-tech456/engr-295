    "message_2": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. GRBs are classified into two types: short-duration GRBs and long-duration GRBs. Short-duration GRBs last less than 2 seconds, while long-duration GRBs last more than 2 seconds.\n\nIt is important to note that gamma-ray bursts are not directly related to the mass of black holes. Instead, they are thought to be caused by the collapse of massive stars (for long-duration GRBs) or the merger of neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole (for short-duration GRBs). However, the energy output and time duration of GRBs can be influenced by the properties of the central engine, which could be a black hole.\n\nThe energy output of a gamma-ray burst is typically measured in units of ergs. The isotropic-equivalent energy output of a GRB can range from 10^48 to 10^54 ergs. However, the actual energy output is likely to be lower due to the beaming effect, which means that the gamma-ray burst is not radiating energy uniformly in all directions.\n\nThe time duration of a gamma-ray burst depends on the type of GRB and the specific event. Short-duration GRBs last less than 2 seconds, while long-duration GRBs can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The duration of a GRB is thought to be related to the properties of the central engine, such as the mass and spin of the black hole.\n\nIn summary, the energy output and time duration of gamma-ray bursts originating from black holes with a mass of one million solar masses cannot be directly determined based on the mass of the black hole alone. However, the energy output of a GRB can range from 10^48 to 10^54 ergs, and the time duration can vary from less than 2 seconds for short-duration GRBs to several minutes for long-duration GRBs."
