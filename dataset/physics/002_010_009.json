    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat energy required to vaporize 100g of water, we need to consider two steps:\n\n1. Heating the water from 20°C to 100°C\n2. Vaporizing the water at 100°C\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy required to heat the water from 20°C to 100°C. We will use the formula:\n\nQ1 = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q1 is the heat energy required, m is the mass of water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 100g\nc = 4.18 J/g°C (specific heat capacity of water)\nΔT = 100°C - 20°C = 80°C\n\nQ1 = (100g)(4.18 J/g°C)(80°C) = 33440 J\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy required to vaporize the water at 100°C. We will use the formula:\n\nQ2 = nL\n\nwhere Q2 is the heat energy required, n is the number of moles of water, and L is the latent heat of vaporization.\n\nGiven:\nL = 40.7 kJ/mol\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of water. The molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol.\n\nn = mass / molar mass\nn = 100g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 5.55 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate Q2:\n\nQ2 = (5.55 mol)(40.7 kJ/mol) = 225.885 kJ\n\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we have:\n\nQ2 = 225.885 kJ * 1000 J/kJ = 225885 J\n\nFinally, we can find the total heat energy required by adding the energy required for both steps:\n\nQ_total = Q1 + Q2\nQ_total = 33440 J + 225885 J = 259325 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat energy required to vaporize 100g of water, initially at 20°C, into steam at 100°C is 259,325 J."
