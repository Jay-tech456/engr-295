    "message_2": "The sharpness of an object's image perceived by the eye depends on the angular resolution of the eye. The angular resolution is the ability of the eye to distinguish two separate points in the field of view. The human eye has a typical angular resolution of about 1 arcminute (1/60 of a degree).\n\nTo develop a mathematical formula to explain this phenomenon, we can use the concept of angular size. The angular size (θ) of an object is the angle it subtends at the eye, and it depends on the actual size of the object (s) and the distance between the object and the eye (d). The relationship between these variables can be described using the small-angle approximation formula:\n\nθ = s / d\n\nwhere θ is the angular size in radians, s is the actual size of the object, and d is the distance between the object and the eye.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum size of an object (s_min) that can be resolved by the eye at a given distance (d). This minimum size can be determined using the angular resolution of the eye (θ_res), which is approximately 1 arcminute or 1/60 of a degree:\n\nθ_res = s_min / d\n\nTo convert the angular resolution from arcminutes to radians, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 radian = 180°/π ≈ 57.3°\n\nSo, 1 arcminute in radians is:\n\n1/60 * (π/180) ≈ 0.00029 radians\n\nNow, we can rewrite the formula for the minimum size of an object that can be resolved by the eye:\n\n0.00029 = s_min / d\n\nSolving for s_min, we get:\n\ns_min = 0.00029 * d\n\nThis formula shows that the minimum size of an object that can be resolved by the eye (s_min) is directly proportional to the distance between the object and the eye (d). As the distance increases, the minimum size of the object that can be resolved also increases, which means that the sharpness of the object's image perceived by the eye decreases with increasing distance."
