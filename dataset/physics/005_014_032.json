    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c^2)\n\nwhere v_rel is the relative velocity of particle B with respect to particle A, v_A is the velocity of particle A, v_B is the velocity of particle B, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSince particle P decays into two identical particles A and B, and particle A moves in the positive x direction with a speed of 0.8c, particle B must move in the negative x direction with the same speed to conserve momentum. Therefore, v_B = -0.8c.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv_rel = (-0.8c - 0.8c) / (1 - (-0.8c * 0.8c) / c^2)\nv_rel = (-1.6c) / (1 - 0.64)\nv_rel = (-1.6c) / 0.36\nv_rel = -4.44c\n\nHowever, this result is not physically possible, as no object can move faster than the speed of light. This indicates that we made an error in our calculations. The mistake lies in the fact that we used the wrong sign for v_B in the formula. Since particle B is moving in the opposite direction of particle A, we should use the positive value for v_B. So, v_B = 0.8c.\n\nNow, let's redo the calculation with the correct value for v_B:\n\nv_rel = (0.8c - 0.8c) / (1 - (0.8c * 0.8c) / c^2)\nv_rel = (0) / (1 - 0.64)\nv_rel = 0\n\nSo, the relative velocity of particle B with respect to particle A is 0. This means that both particles are moving at the same speed in opposite directions, and an observer in the reference frame of particle A would see particle B moving at the same speed as particle A, which is 0.8c."
