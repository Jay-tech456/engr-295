What is the time dilation factor between the crew's proper time and the time measured by someone observing the spaceship from Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula in the context of a Schwarzschild black hole. The time dilation factor is given by:\n\nγ = (1 - rs/r)^(-1/2)\n\nwhere γ is the time dilation factor, rs is the Schwarzschild radius (2GM/c^2), r is the radial coordinate of the spaceship (distance from the black hole), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given the Schwarzschild radius (rs) as 10 km, and we need to find the radial coordinate (r) of the spaceship. To do this, we can use the formula for the stable circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole:\n\nr = 3rs\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nr = 3 * 10 km = 30 km\n\nNow we can plug the values into the time dilation formula:\n\nγ = (1 - 10/30)^(-1/2)\nγ = (1 - 1/3)^(-1/2)\nγ = (2/3)^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we are given that the proper time experienced by the crew is 10 years. To find the time measured by someone observing the spaceship from Earth, we can use the following formula:\n\nt = γ * τ\n\nwhere t is the time measured by the observer on Earth, and τ is the proper time experienced by the crew.\n\nIn this case:\n\nt = (2/3)^(-1/2) * 10 years\n\nNow, we can calculate the time dilation factor:\n\nγ = t / τ\n\nWe already have the expression for t:\n\nγ = ((2/3)^(-1/2) * 10 years) / 10 years\n\nThe years cancel out:\n\nγ = (2/3)^(-1/2)\n\nSo, the time dilation factor between the crew's proper time and the time measured by someone observing the spaceship from Earth is:\n\nγ ≈ 1.225"
