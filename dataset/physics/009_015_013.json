    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image formed, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. For a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is equal to twice the focal length (f = R/2). In this case, the radius of curvature is 30 cm, so the focal length is 15 cm.\n\n1/15 = 1/40 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(40 + v) / (40 * v) = 1/15\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n15(40 + v) = 40v\n\n600 + 15v = 40v\n\n600 = 25v\n\nv = 24 cm\n\nSo, the distance of the image formed is 24 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -24/40\n\nM = -0.6\n\nNow, we can find the size of the image (h') using the magnification and the size of the object (h):\n\nh' = M * h\n\nh' = -0.6 * 2\n\nh' = -1.2 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. However, since the mirror has a spherical aberration of 1 cm, the actual size of the image will be slightly different. Spherical aberration causes the image to be distorted, but it does not affect the size of the image linearly. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the 1 cm aberration to the size of the image. The size of the image will still be approximately 1.2 cm, but the shape may be distorted due to the spherical aberration."
