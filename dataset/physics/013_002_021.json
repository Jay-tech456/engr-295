    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a star can have and still go through the process of nucleosynthesis leading to a supernova explosion is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit is not a fixed value but rather depends on various factors, including the star's composition and structure. However, a rough estimate for the maximum mass is around 20-25 solar masses.\n\nThe metallicity of a star, which refers to the proportion of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in its composition, can influence the maximum mass for a supernova explosion. Stars with higher metallicity tend to have stronger stellar winds, which can cause them to lose mass more rapidly. This mass loss can affect the star's evolution and, in some cases, prevent it from reaching the supernova stage.\n\nIn general, stars with lower metallicity can have a higher maximum mass for a supernova explosion. This is because they experience less mass loss due to weaker stellar winds. However, it is essential to note that the relationship between metallicity and maximum mass for a supernova is complex and depends on various factors, such as the star's initial mass and evolutionary stage.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass for a star to undergo nucleosynthesis leading to a supernova explosion is approximately 20-25 solar masses, but this value can be influenced by the star's metallicity. Lower metallicity stars can have a higher maximum mass for a supernova explosion due to reduced mass loss from weaker stellar winds."
