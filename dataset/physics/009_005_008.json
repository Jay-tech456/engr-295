    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the radius of curvature R is equal to 2 times the focal length (f = R/2). In this case, the radius of curvature is 20 cm, so the focal length is:\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nThe object distance (u) is given as 10 cm. Since the object is placed in front of the mirror, the object distance is considered negative (u = -10 cm).\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/10\n1/v = 2/10\nv = 10/2 = 5 cm\n\nSince the image distance (v) is positive, the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a real image.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u\n\nSubstituting the values of v and u, we get:\nM = -5 / (-10) = 1/2\n\nThe magnification is 1/2, which means the image is half the size of the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real, upright, and half the size of the object. It is located 5 cm in front of the mirror on the same side as the object."
