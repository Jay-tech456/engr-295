    "message_1": "A ray of light strikes a plane mirror at an angle of 35 degrees from the normal. Calculate the angle of reflection and the angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray. Also, if the distance between the object and the mirror is 5m, what is the distance between the image and the mirror?",
    "message_2": "According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, if the angle of incidence (the angle between the incident ray and the normal) is 35 degrees, the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected ray and the normal) is also 35 degrees.\n\nTo find the angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles of incidence and reflection is equal to the angle between the incident and reflected rays. Since both angles are 35 degrees, the angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray is:\n\nAngle = Angle of incidence + Angle of reflection\nAngle = 35° + 35°\nAngle = 70°\n\nIn a plane mirror, the image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. Therefore, if the distance between the object and the mirror is 5 meters, the distance between the image and the mirror is also 5 meters."
