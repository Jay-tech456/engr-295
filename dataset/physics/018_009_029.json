    "message_2": "The maximum amount of entropy that can be contained in a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, which states that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is:\n\nS = (k * A) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, A is the area of the event horizon, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThis formula implies that the entropy of a black hole is directly related to the area of its event horizon. As a black hole gains mass, its event horizon area increases, and so does its entropy. This relationship between entropy and the event horizon area is a key insight in understanding the thermodynamics of black holes and has led to the development of the holographic principle, which suggests that the information content of a region of space can be described by the information on the boundary of that region."
