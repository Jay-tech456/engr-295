    "message_1": "What is the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with masses 10 and 5 solar masses, respectively, that are orbiting each other at a distance of 100 km and are about to merge together?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * D)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM1 = mass of the first black hole (10 solar masses)\nM2 = mass of the second black hole (5 solar masses)\nc = speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\nr = distance between the black holes (100 km)\nD = distance from the observer to the binary system\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore:\n\nM1 = 10 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\nM2 = 5 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the black holes from kilometers to meters:\n\nr = 100 km * 1000 m/km = 1.0 × 10^5 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^2 * (1.989 × 10^31 kg) * (9.945 × 10^30 kg)) / ((2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * (1.0 × 10^5 m) * D)\n\nh = (4 * (4.468 × 10^-22) * (1.979 × 10^62 kg^2)) / ((8.077 × 10^33 m^4/s^4) * (1.0 × 10^5 m) * D)\n\nh = (3.542 × 10^40 kg^2) / (8.077 × 10^38 m^3/s^4 * D)\n\nh = 4.384 × 10^1 / D\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the distance (D) from the observer to the binary system. The closer the observer is to the system, the larger the amplitude of the gravitational waves."
