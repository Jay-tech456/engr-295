    "message_1": "A motor has a current of 4 amps flowing through a wire that creates a magnetic field of 0.5 Tesla at a distance of 2 cm from the wire. What will be the magnetic field if the current is increased to 6 amps and the distance from the wire is reduced to 1 cm?",
    "message_2": "We can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic field when the current is 4 amps and the distance is 2 cm:\n\nB₁ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\nB₁ = (16π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A) / (0.04π)\nB₁ = 0.5 T (given)\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field when the current is increased to 6 amps and the distance is reduced to 1 cm:\n\nB₂ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 6 A) / (2 * π * 0.01 m)\nB₂ = (24π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A) / (0.02π)\nB₂ = 1.2 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field when the current is increased to 6 amps and the distance from the wire is reduced to 1 cm will be 1.2 Tesla."
