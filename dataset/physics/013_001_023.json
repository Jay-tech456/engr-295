Assuming that the particle follows a circular orbit and the accretion disk has a negligible effect on the particle's motion, calculate the answer in seconds.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the orbital period of a test particle at a distance of 10 Schwarzschild radii from a black hole of 10 solar masses, we can use the following formula for the period of a circular orbit around a massive object:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(r³ / GM)\n\nwhere T is the orbital period, r is the distance from the center of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole:\n\nRs = 2GM / c²\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the mass of the black hole (10 solar masses), and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s). \n\n1 solar mass (Ms) is approximately 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg, so:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNow, we can find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.989 × 10³¹ kg) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)²\nRs ≈ 2.95 × 10³ m\n\nThe test particle is located at a distance of 10 Schwarzschild radii, so:\n\nr = 10 * Rs = 10 * 2.95 × 10³ m = 2.95 × 10⁴ m\n\nNow, we can find the orbital period T:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt((2.95 × 10⁴ m)³ / (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.989 × 10³¹ kg))\nT ≈ 2π * sqrt(2.56 × 10¹³ m³ / (1.33 × 10²¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²))\nT ≈ 2π * sqrt(1.93 × 10⁻⁸ s²)\nT ≈ 2π * 4.39 × 10⁻⁴ s\nT ≈ 2.76 × 10⁻³ s\n\nSo, the orbital period of the test particle is approximately 2.76 × 10⁻³ seconds."
