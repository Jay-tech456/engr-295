    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron tunneling through a finite potential barrier, we can use the transmission coefficient (T) formula derived from the Schrödinger equation for a rectangular potential barrier. The formula for the transmission coefficient is:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * d)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))\n\nwhere:\n- T is the transmission coefficient (probability of tunneling)\n- V₀ is the potential barrier height (2 eV)\n- E is the energy of the electron (4 eV)\n- d is the thickness of the barrier (1 nm)\n- k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier, given by k2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V₀ - E) / hbar^2), where m is the electron mass and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nFirst, let's calculate k2:\n\nm = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg (electron mass)\nhbar = 1.054571817 × 10^-34 Js (reduced Planck constant)\nV₀ - E = 2 eV - 4 eV = -2 eV = -3.204 × 10^-19 J (converting eV to J)\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * m * (-3.204 × 10^-19 J) / hbar^2)\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg * (-3.204 × 10^-19 J) / (1.054571817 × 10^-34 Js)^2)\nk2 = sqrt(-4.413 × 10^9 m^-2)\nk2 is imaginary since the electron energy is higher than the potential barrier height.\n\nNow, let's calculate the transmission coefficient T:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (2 eV^2 * sinh^2(k2 * 1 nm)) / (4 * 4 eV * (2 eV - 4 eV)))\nT = 1 / (1 + (4 eV^2 * sinh^2(imaginary number)) / (16 eV^2))\nT = 1 / (1 + 0)\nT = 1\n\nThe transmission coefficient T is 1, which means the probability of the electron tunneling through the finite potential barrier is 100%. This is expected since the electron's energy (4 eV) is higher than the potential barrier height (2 eV), so the electron can pass through the barrier without tunneling."
