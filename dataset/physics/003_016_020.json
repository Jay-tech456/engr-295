    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the triangle is not an equilateral triangle, we need to find the height (h) and the base (b) of the triangle to determine the position vector (r). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:\n\nh = sqrt(5² - 4²) = sqrt(9) = 3 cm\n\nNow, we can find the base:\n\nb = 8 - 2 * 4 = 0 cm\n\nThe position vector r from the center of the triangle to the midpoint of the side with length 8 cm is:\n\nr = h/3 = 3/3 = 1 cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center of the triangle using the Biot-Savart Law. Since the triangle has three sides, we need to calculate the magnetic field due to each side and then add them up.\n\nFor each side of the triangle, the magnetic field is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nFor the two sides with length 5 cm, the magnetic field is:\n\ndB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (3 * 5 x 1) / 1³ = (3μ₀ / 4π) * 5\n\nFor the side with length 8 cm, the magnetic field is:\n\ndB₂ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (3 * 8 x 1) / 1³ = (3μ₀ / 4π) * 8\n\nNow, we can add up the magnetic fields due to each side:\n\nB_total = dB₁ + dB₁ + dB₂ = (3μ₀ / 4π) * (5 + 5 + 8) = (3μ₀ / 4π) * 18\n\nB_total = (3 * 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * 18 = 54 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop is 54 × 10^(-7) T or 5.4 × 10^(-6) T."
