    "message_2": "In a ferromagnetic material, the relationship between temperature and magnetization is governed by the Curie-Weiss Law. As the temperature increases, the magnetization of the material decreases. This is because the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments of the atoms to become more randomly oriented, reducing the overall magnetization.\n\nThe Curie-Weiss Law can be expressed as:\n\nM = C (T - Tc)^(-β)\n\nwhere M is the magnetization, C is a material-specific constant, T is the temperature, Tc is the Curie temperature (the temperature above which the material loses its ferromagnetic properties), and β is the critical exponent (typically close to 0.5 for ferromagnetic materials).\n\nThe relationship between magnetization and the strength of an applied magnetic field is described by the Langevin function. When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of the atoms tend to align with the field, increasing the overall magnetization of the material. The stronger the applied magnetic field, the greater the magnetization.\n\nThe Langevin function can be expressed as:\n\nL(x) = coth(x) - 1/x\n\nwhere x = (μ₀ * μ * H) / (k * T), μ₀ is the vacuum permeability, μ is the magnetic moment of the atoms, H is the applied magnetic field, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nIn summary, the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material decreases with increasing temperature and increases with the strength of an applied magnetic field. The specific relationship between these variables is described by the Curie-Weiss Law and the Langevin function."
