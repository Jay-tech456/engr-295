    "message_1": "A solenoid has 500 turns and is 1 meter long. If a current of 5 A flows through the solenoid, what is the magnetic field at its center?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total turns / length\nn = 500 turns / 1 meter\nn = 500 turns/meter\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (500 turns/meter) * (5 A)\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (2500 turns*meter/A)\nB ≈ (1.2566 × 10⁻⁶ T) * (2500)\nB ≈ 3.1415 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the solenoid is approximately 3.1415 × 10⁻³ T (Tesla)."
