    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise problem for a physics student to solve on the topic \"Calculation of magnetic field due to a current-carrying coil\":\n\nA current-carrying coil of radius 5 cm has 200 turns and carries a current of 0.5 A. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil along its axis. Assume that the coil has a uniform current density.\n\nThe student would need to use the formula for magnetic field due to a current-carrying coil and plug in the given values to calculate the required magnetic field magnitude at the mentioned point.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying coil along its axis, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (the permeability of free space)\nI = 0.5 A (current)\nN = 200 turns (number of turns in the coil)\nR = 0.05 m (radius of the coil, converted from 5 cm)\nx = 0.1 m (distance from the center of the coil along its axis, converted from 10 cm)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.5 A * 200 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 0.5 * 200 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (1.57 × 10^(-6) * 0.5 * 200 * 0.0025) / (2 * 0.0125^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (6.283 × 10^(-7) * 200 * 0.0025) / (2 * 0.044194)\n\nB ≈ (3.141 × 10^(-4)) / (2 * 0.044194)\n\nB ≈ 3.55 × 10^(-3) T\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the coil along its axis is approximately 3.55 × 10^(-3) T (tesla)."
