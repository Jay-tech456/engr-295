How does its magnetic field change when it is cooled below its critical temperature? What is the maximum magnetic field that this magnet can generate?",
    "message_2": "YBa2Cu3O7, also known as YBCO, is a high-temperature superconductor. Its critical temperature (Tc) is around 93 K (-180 °C). Liquid nitrogen has a boiling point of 77 K (-196 °C), so when the YBCO magnet is immersed in liquid nitrogen, it is cooled below its critical temperature, and it becomes superconducting.\n\nIn the superconducting state, the critical magnetic field (Hc) of YBCO is not a constant value but depends on the temperature. At 77 K, the critical magnetic field of YBCO is approximately 1-2 Tesla. However, this value can vary depending on the specific sample and its preparation.\n\nWhen the magnet is cooled below its critical temperature, it enters the superconducting state, and its electrical resistance drops to zero. In this state, the magnetic field lines are expelled from the superconductor due to the Meissner effect. This means that the magnetic field inside the superconductor becomes zero, while the magnetic field outside the superconductor is enhanced.\n\nThe maximum magnetic field that a YBCO magnet can generate depends on the specific design of the magnet and the arrangement of the superconducting coils. In general, YBCO magnets can generate magnetic fields of up to 20-30 Tesla. However, this value can be higher for specially designed magnets or when combined with other magnetic materials. It is important to note that the generated magnetic field should not exceed the critical magnetic field of the superconductor, as this would cause the material to lose its superconducting properties."
