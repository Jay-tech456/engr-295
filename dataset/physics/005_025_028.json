    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy of the electron, we first need to calculate its relativistic mass using the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron (0.8c) and c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass (m'):\n\nm' = γ * m\nm' = 1.67 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg\nm' ≈ 1.52 x 10^-30 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic energy (E) using the formula:\n\nE = m' * c^2\nE ≈ 1.52 x 10^-30 kg * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 1.37 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow that we have the relativistic energy, we can find the de Broglie wavelength (λ) using the formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.63 x 10^-34 J-s) and p is the relativistic momentum, which can be calculated as:\n\np = m' * v\np ≈ 1.52 x 10^-30 kg * 0.8 * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 3.64 x 10^-22 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can find the de Broglie wavelength:\n\nλ = h / p\nλ ≈ (6.63 x 10^-34 J-s) / (3.64 x 10^-22 kg m/s)\nλ ≈ 1.82 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the electron is approximately 1.37 x 10^-13 J, and its de Broglie wavelength is approximately 1.82 x 10^-12 m."
