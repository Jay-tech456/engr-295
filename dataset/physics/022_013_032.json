    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter and dark energy significantly affects the expansion of the universe. Dark matter, which is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, contributes to the overall mass of the universe. This mass has a gravitational effect, which would generally slow down the expansion of the universe.\n\nHowever, dark energy, which is a form of energy that permeates all of space, has a repulsive effect on the expansion of the universe. It is believed to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still not well understood, but it is thought to make up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe.\n\nIn the relationship between dark matter and dark energy, dark matter acts as a gravitational force that tries to pull everything together, while dark energy works against this force, causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The balance between these two forces determines the overall expansion rate and the ultimate fate of the universe.\n\nIn summary, dark matter affects the expansion of the universe by contributing to its overall mass and gravitational pull, while dark energy counteracts this effect by causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The interplay between these two forces is crucial in understanding the behavior and evolution of the universe."
