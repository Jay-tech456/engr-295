    "message_2": "To calculate the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) for a non-spinning black hole, we can use the Schwarzschild metric. For a non-spinning black hole, the ISCO radius is given by:\n\nr_ISCO = 6 * GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, for a 10 solar mass black hole:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for G and c:\n\nG = 6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\n\nr_ISCO = 6 * (6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2)) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_ISCO â‰ˆ 8.861 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit for a non-spinning black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 88,610 meters or 88.61 km."
