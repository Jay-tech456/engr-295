    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole, as described by the Schwarzschild metric in General Relativity, is given by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs). The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo find the event horizon radius for a black hole of mass M, simply plug the mass into the formula and solve for Rs."
