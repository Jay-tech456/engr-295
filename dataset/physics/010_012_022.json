    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer, we will use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The boundary layer thickness (δ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nδ = (5 * x) / sqrt(Re_x)\n\nwhere x is the distance from the leading edge (10 cm in this case) and Re_x is the Reynolds number at that distance, which can be calculated as:\n\nRe_x = (ρ * U * x) / μ\n\nHere, ρ is the density of air (1.2 kg/m^3), U is the velocity of air (50 m/s), and μ is the dynamic viscosity of air (1.8 × 10^-5 Pa·s).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Reynolds number:\n\nRe_x = (1.2 kg/m^3 * 50 m/s * 0.1 m) / (1.8 × 10^-5 Pa·s)\nRe_x ≈ 333333.33\n\nNow, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness:\n\nδ = (5 * 0.1 m) / sqrt(333333.33)\nδ ≈ 0.000866 m\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer after a distance of 10 cm from the leading edge is approximately 0.000866 meters or 0.866 mm."
