    "message_2": "To calculate the interplanar distance (d) between two adjacent crystal planes in a copper crystal with a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure using X-ray diffraction data, we can use Bragg's Law:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is the order of diffraction (we'll assume n = 1 for the first order), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (1.54 Å), and θ is the Bragg angle (32°).\n\nFirst, let's find the value of 2 * sin(θ):\n\n2 * sin(32°) = 2 * sin(32 * π / 180) (converting degrees to radians)\n2 * sin(32°) ≈ 1.056\n\nNow, we can rearrange Bragg's Law to solve for the interplanar distance (d):\n\nd = nλ / (2 * sin(θ))\nd = (1 * 1.54 Å) / 1.056\nd ≈ 1.46 Å\n\nThe interplanar distance between two adjacent crystal planes in a copper crystal with a face-centered cubic structure is approximately 1.46 Å."
