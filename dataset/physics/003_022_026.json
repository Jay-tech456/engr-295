    "message_1": "A certain motor has a current of 5 A moving through its wire, with a length of 2 meters and placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field produced by the motor?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the motor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nHowever, we are not given the distance r from the wire in this problem. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the motor at a specific point. Instead, we can express the magnetic field as a function of distance r:\n\nB(r) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * r)\nB(r) = (2 × 10⁻⁶ Tm) / r\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field produced by the motor can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. In this case, the magnetic field lines will form concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the direction of the current.\n\nIn summary, we cannot determine the exact magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the motor without knowing the distance from the wire, but we can express it as a function of distance: B(r) = (2 × 10⁻⁶ Tm) / r. The direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule and forms concentric circles around the wire."
