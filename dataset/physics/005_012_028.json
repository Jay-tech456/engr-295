    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton, we will use the following formula:\n\nRelativistic kinetic energy (K) = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, we need the mass of the proton (m). The mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy (K):\n\nK = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\nK = (2.294 - 1) * (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 1.294 * (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) * (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 2.16 × 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 2.16 × 10^-10 Joules."
