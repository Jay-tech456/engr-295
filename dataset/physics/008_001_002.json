    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has several decay modes, which are the various ways it can decay into other particles. These decay modes are crucial for understanding its properties and interactions with other particles in the Standard Model.\n\nThe decay modes of the Higgs boson are determined by its mass, which has been measured to be approximately 125 GeV/c². The most common decay modes of the Higgs boson are:\n\n1. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (b and b-bar): This is the most probable decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%.\n\n2. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%.\n\n3. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons (τ+ and τ-): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6%.\n\n4. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of charm quarks (c and c-bar): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 3%.\n\n5. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of Z bosons (Z and Z): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.5%.\n\n6. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of gluons (g and g): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2%.\n\n7. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons (γ and γ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%.\n\n8. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of muons (μ+ and μ-): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.02%.\n\nThe measured mass of the Higgs boson determines its properties and interactions with other particles in the Standard Model. The mass of the Higgs boson is related to the strength of its coupling to other particles. In general, the heavier the particle, the stronger its interaction with the Higgs boson. This is why the Higgs boson predominantly decays into bottom quarks and W bosons, which are relatively heavy particles.\n\nMoreover, the Higgs boson's mass also affects the rate at which it is produced and decays. A heavier Higgs boson would have a shorter lifetime and would be produced less frequently in particle collisions. The measured mass of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV/c² is consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model, confirming its role in the Higgs mechanism and providing crucial information about its properties and interactions with other particles."
