    "message_2": "The predicted rate of gravitational wave mergers from binary neutron star systems in the Milky Way galaxy depends on several factors, including the initial distribution of binary systems, their evolution, and the rate at which new binary systems are formed. \n\nEstimates of the merger rate for binary neutron stars in our galaxy vary widely, mainly due to uncertainties in the parameters involved in the calculations. However, a commonly cited range for the merger rate is between 1 per 100,000 years and 1 per 1,000,000 years.\n\nThis wide range is due to the complex nature of binary neutron star systems and the many factors that influence their evolution, such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution, and the effects of supernova explosions. Additionally, the distribution of binary systems in the galaxy and the rate at which new systems are formed are also uncertain.\n\nAs more gravitational wave detections are made by observatories like LIGO and Virgo, our understanding of binary neutron star systems and their merger rates will continue to improve. This will help refine the estimates and provide a better understanding of the role these systems play in the evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way."
