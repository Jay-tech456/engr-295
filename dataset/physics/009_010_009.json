    "message_2": "To determine the magnification of the image formed, we first need to find the image distance using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length f = 20 cm and the object distance u = 30 cm, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator (60):\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/v\n\nSubtract 2/60 from both sides:\n\n1/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = - (60 cm) / (30 cm)\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object. Since the magnification is negative and the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted."
