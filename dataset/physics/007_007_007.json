    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength required to produce a resonance frequency of 400 MHz for a proton, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nf = (γ * B) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere f is the resonance frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for a proton, B is the magnetic field strength, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio for a proton is approximately 42.577 MHz/T (megahertz per tesla).\n\nWe are given the resonance frequency f = 400 MHz and we need to find the magnetic field strength B. Rearranging the Larmor equation to solve for B, we get:\n\nB = (2 * π * f) / γ\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (2 * π * 400 MHz) / 42.577 MHz/T\n\nB ≈ (2 * 3.14159 * 400) / 42.577\n\nB ≈ 18.850 T\n\nHowever, the problem states that there is already a strong magnetic field of 8.5 T. To find the additional magnetic field strength required to produce the resonance frequency of 400 MHz, we subtract the existing magnetic field:\n\nAdditional B = 18.850 T - 8.5 T\n\nAdditional B ≈ 10.350 T\n\nSo, an additional magnetic field strength of approximately 10.350 T is required to produce a resonance frequency of 400 MHz for a proton in a strong magnetic field of 8.5 T."
