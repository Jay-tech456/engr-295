    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire in the positive y-direction, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 5 A, and the distance r is 2 cm (0.02 m). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) Tm/A * 5 A) / 0.02 m\n\nB = (10^(-5) T * 5) / 0.02 m\n\nB = 5 × 10^(-5) T / 0.02 m\n\nB = 2.5 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire in the positive y-direction is 2.5 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
