    "message_2": "When a circular disc travels close to the speed of light relative to a stationary observer, the apparent shape of the disc will change due to the phenomenon called relativistic length contraction. This effect is a consequence of the special theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein.\n\nAccording to special relativity, the length of an object moving at a high velocity relative to an observer contracts along the direction of motion. The contraction factor is given by the Lorentz factor, which is defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the relative velocity of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn the case of the circular disc, if it is moving edge-on (i.e., its plane is perpendicular to the direction of motion), the length contraction will only affect the thickness of the disc, not its diameter. The disc will appear to be thinner than it actually is, but its circular shape will be preserved.\n\nHowever, if the disc is moving face-on (i.e., its plane is parallel to the direction of motion), the length contraction will affect the diameter of the disc along the direction of motion. In this case, the apparent shape of the disc will change from a circle to an ellipse, with the major axis being the diameter perpendicular to the direction of motion and the minor axis being the contracted diameter along the direction of motion.\n\nIt is important to note that these changes in the apparent shape of the disc are purely due to the relativistic effects on the observer's perception and do not represent any physical deformation of the disc itself."
