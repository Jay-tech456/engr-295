    "message_2": "The age distribution of stars in the Milky Way galaxy is quite diverse, ranging from very young stars that are just a few million years old to ancient stars that are nearly as old as the Universe itself, which is about 13.8 billion years old. The distribution of these stars can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.\n\nThe Milky Way galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy, and its structure can be divided into several components: the central bulge, the thin and thick disks, and the halo. Each of these components has a different age distribution of stars, which is related to the galaxy's formation and evolution.\n\n1. Central Bulge: The central bulge of the Milky Way contains mostly old stars, with ages ranging from 10 to 13 billion years. These stars are primarily metal-poor, which indicates that they were formed during the early stages of the galaxy's formation when there were fewer heavy elements available for star formation. The presence of these old stars suggests that the central bulge formed through the rapid collapse of a massive gas cloud in the early Universe.\n\n2. Thin Disk: The thin disk of the Milky Way contains a mix of young and old stars, with ages ranging from a few million to about 10 billion years. The thin disk is where most of the star formation in the Milky Way occurs, and it is enriched with heavy elements from previous generations of stars. The formation of the thin disk is thought to have occurred through the gradual accretion of gas and smaller satellite galaxies over time.\n\n3. Thick Disk: The thick disk of the Milky Way is composed mainly of older stars, with ages between 8 and 12 billion years. These stars are more metal-rich than those in the central bulge but less so than those in the thin disk. The thick disk is thought to have formed through a combination of processes, including the early collapse of the galaxy's gas and the subsequent heating and stirring of the thin disk by merging satellite galaxies.\n\n4. Halo: The stellar halo of the Milky Way contains the oldest and most metal-poor stars, with ages up to 13 billion years. These stars are thought to be remnants of the first generation of stars that formed in the galaxy, as well as stars that were stripped from smaller satellite galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. The presence of these ancient stars in the halo provides evidence for the hierarchical formation of the galaxy, where smaller structures merge to form larger ones over time.\n\nIn summary, the age distribution of stars in the Milky Way galaxy is closely related to its formation and evolution. The different components of the galaxy, such as the central bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo, each have distinct age distributions that provide clues about the processes that shaped the galaxy throughout its history."
