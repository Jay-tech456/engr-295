In this case, we are asked to find the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state (n=1) to the point where the electron is no longer bound to the atom (n=∞).\n\nThe ionization energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1/n^2)\n\nWhere E is the energy of the electron at a given energy level n, and 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen.\n\nFor the ground state (n=1), the energy is:\n\nE1 = -13.6 eV * (1/1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the case when the electron is no longer bound to the atom (n=∞), the energy is:\n\nE∞ = -13.6 eV * (1/∞^2) = 0 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the difference between these two energy levels:\n\nIonization energy = E∞ - E1 = 0 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom when its electron moves from n=1 to n=∞ is 13.6 eV."
