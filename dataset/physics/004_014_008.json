    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), or about -270.425 degrees Celsius. This temperature is derived from the measurements of the CMB's blackbody spectrum, which is a nearly perfect blackbody radiation with very small deviations.\n\nThe CMB radiation is the remnant thermal radiation from the early universe, dating back to around 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Its temperature and properties provide crucial information about the early universe and support the Big Bang theory. The uniformity of the CMB temperature across the sky, with only tiny fluctuations, indicates that the early universe was in a state of thermal equilibrium, which is consistent with the predictions of the theory of general relativity.\n\nThe small fluctuations in the CMB temperature, at the level of about 1 part in 100,000, are the seeds of the large-scale structures we see in the universe today, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. These fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of cosmic inflation, a theory that suggests a rapid expansion of the universe in its earliest moments. Cosmic inflation is an extension of the Big Bang theory and general relativity, and it helps to explain the observed uniformity and flatness of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation provides strong evidence for the Big Bang theory and the theory of general relativity, as well as supporting the idea of cosmic inflation in the early universe."
