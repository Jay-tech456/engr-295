    "message_2": "To find the force required to separate the two chromosomes, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = k * x\n\nwhere F is the force, k is the spring constant (0.1 N/m), and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nSince the chromosomes are 2 micrometers apart and have a diameter of 1 micrometer, the displacement from the equilibrium position (when the chromosomes are just touching) is:\n\nx = 2 micrometers - 1 micrometer = 1 micrometer\n\nNow, we need to convert the displacement from micrometers to meters:\n\n1 micrometer = 1 * 10^(-6) meters\n\nSo, x = 1 * 10^(-6) meters\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Hooke's Law:\n\nF = (0.1 N/m) * (1 * 10^(-6) m)\n\nF = 1 * 10^(-7) N\n\nTherefore, the force required to separate the two chromosomes is 1 * 10^(-7) Newtons."
