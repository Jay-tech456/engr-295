    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves from a population of binary white dwarfs in our galaxy, we need to consider several factors, including the number of binary white dwarfs, their masses, separation distances, and the sensitivity of the detectors.\n\n1. Number of binary white dwarfs: There are about 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and around 5% of them are white dwarfs. Assuming that 50% of white dwarfs are in binary systems, we have approximately 2.5 billion binary white dwarfs in our galaxy.\n\n2. Masses and separation distances: The masses of white dwarfs typically range from 0.2 to 1.4 solar masses. The separation distances between binary white dwarfs can vary from very close (a few solar radii) to very far apart (several astronomical units). The gravitational wave frequency and amplitude depend on the masses and separation distances of the binary system.\n\n3. Sensitivity of detectors: Currently, the most sensitive gravitational wave detectors are LIGO and Virgo, which are designed to detect gravitational waves from more massive and closer binary systems, such as binary neutron stars and black holes. The frequency range of LIGO and Virgo is between 10 Hz and several kHz, which is not optimal for detecting gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs, as their frequencies are typically in the millihertz range.\n\nThe future space-based detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is expected to be sensitive to gravitational waves in the frequency range of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz, which is more suitable for detecting binary white dwarfs. LISA is planned to be launched in the 2030s.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of detecting gravitational waves from binary white dwarfs with current detectors like LIGO and Virgo is very low. However, with the upcoming LISA mission, the probability will increase significantly. It is difficult to provide an exact probability value without detailed simulations and models, but it is expected that LISA will be able to detect thousands of binary white dwarf systems in our galaxy."
