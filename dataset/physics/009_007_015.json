    "message_2": "To find the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 10 cm\nu = 30 cm\n\nWe need to find v.\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n30 = 3/30 + 1/v\n\nNow, subtract 3/30 from both sides:\n\n(30 - 3) / 30 = 1/v\n\n27 / 30 = 1/v\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 30 / 27\n\nv = 10/9 * 10\n\nv = 100/9 cm\n\nSo, the image will be formed at a distance of 100/9 cm, or approximately 11.11 cm, from the lens."
