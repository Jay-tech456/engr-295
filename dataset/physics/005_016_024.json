    "message_1": "In a particle accelerator, a relativistic electron (mass = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg) with an initial kinetic energy of 3 GeV collides head-on with a stationary proton (mass = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg). If the electron changes direction by 90 degrees after the collision, what is the magnitude of the proton's velocity? Assume the collision is perfectly elastic.",
    "message_2": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. First, we need to find the initial velocity of the electron. Since the electron is relativistic, we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light. We are given K = 3 GeV = 3 x 10^9 eV = 3 x 10^9 x 1.6 x 10^-19 J (converting electron volts to joules). Rearranging the formula and solving for γ:\n\nγ = 1 + K/(mc^2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nγ = 1 + (3 x 10^9 x 1.6 x 10^-19 J) / (9.11 x 10^-31 kg x (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nγ ≈ 6.32\n\nNow we can find the initial velocity of the electron using the Lorentz factor:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ^2)\n\nv ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s * sqrt(1 - 1/6.32^2)\nv ≈ 2.94 x 10^8 m/s\n\nNow we can use the conservation of momentum. Let the final velocities of the electron and proton be ve and vp, respectively. The initial momentum of the proton is 0 since it is stationary:\n\nme * ve_initial + mp * 0 = me * ve_x + mp * vp_x\nmp * vp_x = me * (ve_initial - ve_x)\n\nSince the electron changes direction by 90 degrees, ve_x = ve_initial * cos(90) = 0. Therefore:\n\nmp * vp_x = me * ve_initial\nvp_x = (me * ve_initial) / mp\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nvp_x = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg * 2.94 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)\nvp_x ≈ 1.61 x 10^3 m/s\n\nSince the electron changes direction by 90 degrees, its final velocity in the y-direction is equal to its initial velocity in the x-direction. Therefore, the proton's final velocity in the y-direction is equal to the electron's final velocity in the y-direction:\n\nvp_y = me * ve_initial / mp\nvp_y = (9.11 x 10^-31 kg * 2.94 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)\nvp_y ≈ 1.61 x 10^3 m/s\n\nNow we can find the magnitude of the proton's velocity:\n\nvp = sqrt(vp_x^2 + vp_y^2)\nvp = sqrt((1.61 x 10^3 m/s)^2 + (1.61 x 10^3 m/s)^2)\nvp ≈ 2.28 x 10^3 m/s\n\nSo the magnitude of the proton's velocity after the collision is approximately 2.28 x 10^3 m/s."
