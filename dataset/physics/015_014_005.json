    "message_2": "The frequency and strength of gravitational waves emitted by a population of primordial black holes depend on the masses of the black holes and the distance between them. For a pair of black holes with masses M1 and M2, the frequency (f) of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (M1 + M2))^(1/2) / (pi * (M1 * M2)^(1/2))\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and pi is the mathematical constant.\n\nThe strength of the gravitational waves, or the strain amplitude (h), can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (G * (M1 * M2)^(1/2) / (c^2 * r)) * (G * (M1 + M2) / (c^2 * r))^(-1/2)\n\nwhere r is the distance between the black holes.\n\nGiven a uniform distribution of masses between 10 and 1000 solar masses, we can calculate the expected frequency and strength of gravitational waves for different mass combinations. However, it is important to note that these calculations are based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual values may vary depending on the specific properties of the primordial black holes and their environment.\n\nAs for the probability of detecting these signals using current and upcoming gravitational wave observatories, it depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the frequency range they can observe. LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to frequencies between ~10 Hz and several kHz, while the planned LISA mission is expected to be sensitive to lower frequencies, between ~0.1 mHz and 1 Hz.\n\nPrimordial black holes with masses between 10 and 1000 solar masses are expected to emit gravitational waves with frequencies in the range detectable by LIGO and Virgo, and possibly LISA as well. The probability of detection will depend on the actual distribution of primordial black holes, their merger rates, and the sensitivity of the detectors. While it is difficult to provide an exact probability, the detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo in recent years suggests that there is a non-negligible chance of detecting signals from primordial black holes with current and upcoming observatories."
