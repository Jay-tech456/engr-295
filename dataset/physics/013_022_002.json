    "message_2": "Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are black holes with masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. They are typically found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. The formation and evolution of SMBHs are still subjects of ongoing research, but several theories have been proposed to explain their origins and growth.\n\n1. Direct collapse: In the early universe, dense regions of gas could have collapsed directly into black holes without forming stars. These \"seed\" black holes would then grow over time by accreting surrounding gas and merging with other black holes. This process is more likely to occur in regions with low metallicity, as the presence of metals can lead to more efficient cooling and fragmentation of the gas, favoring star formation instead of direct collapse.\n\n2. Stellar remnants: Another possibility is that SMBHs form from the remnants of massive stars. In this scenario, the first generation of massive stars (Population III stars) would have formed from primordial gas, and their subsequent supernova explosions would leave behind black holes. These black holes could then grow by accreting gas and merging with other black holes.\n\n3. Star cluster collapse: Dense star clusters could also lead to the formation of SMBHs. In this scenario, the core of a massive star cluster collapses due to gravitational interactions between stars, eventually forming a black hole. This black hole would then grow by accreting gas and merging with other black holes.\n\nFactors that contribute to the growth of SMBHs include:\n\n1. Gas accretion: SMBHs can grow by accreting gas from their surroundings. This gas forms an accretion disk around the black hole, and as it spirals inward, it releases energy in the form of radiation. The rate of accretion depends on the availability of gas and the properties of the accretion disk.\n\n2. Black hole mergers: SMBHs can also grow by merging with other black holes. This process is more likely to occur in dense environments, such as galactic centers or galaxy clusters, where black hole encounters are more frequent.\n\n3. Galaxy mergers: When galaxies merge, their central black holes can eventually become gravitationally bound and merge as well. This process is thought to be an important driver of SMBH growth in the universe.\n\nImpact on galactic structures:\n\n1. AGN feedback: As SMBHs accrete gas, they release energy in the form of radiation and jets (active galactic nuclei, or AGN). This energy can heat and expel gas from the host galaxy, suppressing star formation and regulating the growth of the galaxy. This process, known as AGN feedback, is thought to play a crucial role in shaping the observed properties of galaxies, such as their sizes and stellar masses.\n\n2. Gravitational interactions: SMBHs can also influence the dynamics of stars and gas in their host galaxies through gravitational interactions. For example, the presence of a SMBH can lead to the formation of a dense nuclear star cluster, and it can also affect the orbits of stars and gas clouds in the galactic center.\n\n3. Gravitational waves: Merging SMBHs emit gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime that propagate through the universe. The detection of these waves can provide valuable information about the properties of SMBHs and their host galaxies, as well as the history of galaxy formation and evolution."
