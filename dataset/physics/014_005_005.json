    "message_2": "The distribution of galaxies and the cosmic web structure provide evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe through several key observations and phenomena:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: When light from distant galaxies passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the light is bent, causing the images of the background galaxies to be distorted. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. Observations show that the mass distribution inferred from lensing is much greater than the mass that can be accounted for by visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation curves of galaxies, which show the relationship between the distance from the galactic center and the orbital speed of stars and gas, provide another piece of evidence for dark matter. According to Newtonian gravity, the orbital speed should decrease with distance from the center. However, observations show that the rotation curves remain flat or even increase at large distances, indicating the presence of additional, unseen mass â€“ dark matter.\n\n3. Large-scale structure formation: The cosmic web structure, consisting of galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids, is thought to have formed through the gravitational collapse of dark matter and baryonic matter. Dark matter is believed to have played a crucial role in this process, as its gravitational influence would have provided the initial seeds for the formation of the large-scale structures we observe today. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n4. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains tiny temperature fluctuations, or anisotropies, that provide information about the early universe. The observed pattern of these anisotropies is consistent with a universe dominated by dark matter, as the presence of dark matter affects the way in which the anisotropies evolve over time.\n\n5. Galaxy cluster dynamics: The motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters can be used to estimate the total mass of the cluster. Observations show that the mass inferred from the dynamics of galaxies is much greater than the mass that can be accounted for by visible matter, again pointing to the presence of dark matter.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of galaxies and the cosmic web structure provide evidence for the existence of dark matter through various observations and phenomena, such as gravitational lensing, galaxy rotation curves, large-scale structure formation, CMB anisotropies, and galaxy cluster dynamics. These observations consistently indicate the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter."
