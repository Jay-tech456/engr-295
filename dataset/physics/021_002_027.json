    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole and the size of its event horizon can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula for non-rotating black holes and the Kerr metric for rotating black holes.\n\nFor a non-rotating black hole (also known as a Schwarzschild black hole), the size of the event horizon is determined by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which is directly proportional to its mass (M). The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. The event horizon is a spherical surface with a radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nFor a rotating black hole (also known as a Kerr black hole), the size and shape of the event horizon are determined by the mass (M) and the angular momentum (J) of the black hole. The Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime around a rotating black hole. In this case, the event horizon is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, which means it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nThe radius of the event horizon for a Kerr black hole depends on the mass and angular momentum and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nR+ = GM/c^2 + sqrt((GM/c^2)^2 - (GJ/cM)^2)\n\nwhere R+ is the radius of the outer event horizon, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, J is the angular momentum, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn summary, the size of a black hole's event horizon is directly related to its mass and is also influenced by its rotation. The event horizon of a non-rotating black hole is a perfect sphere, while the event horizon of a rotating black hole is an oblate spheroid."
