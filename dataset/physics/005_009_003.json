    "message_1": "What is the change in frequency observed in a moving observer for a sound source with a frequency of 1000 Hz and a velocity of 50 m/s towards the observer? The observer is moving with a velocity of 30 m/s towards the source of sound. The speed of sound in this medium is 330 m/s. (Assume classical Doppler effect conditions are met).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Doppler effect formula for sound:\n\nf' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs)\n\nwhere:\nf' is the observed frequency,\nf is the source frequency,\nv is the speed of sound in the medium,\nvo is the velocity of the observer relative to the medium (positive if moving towards the source, negative if moving away),\nvs is the velocity of the source relative to the medium (positive if moving away from the observer, negative if moving towards).\n\nIn this case, we have:\nf = 1000 Hz\nv = 330 m/s\nvo = -30 m/s (negative since the observer is moving towards the source)\nvs = 50 m/s (positive since the source is moving towards the observer)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf' = 1000 * (330 - 30) / (330 + 50)\nf' = 1000 * (300) / (380)\nf' ≈ 1000 * 0.7895\nf' ≈ 789.5 Hz\n\nThe change in frequency observed by the moving observer is approximately 789.5 Hz - 1000 Hz = -210.5 Hz."
