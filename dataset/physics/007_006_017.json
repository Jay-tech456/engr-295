    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula and Bragg's law.\n\n1. First, let's find the de Broglie wavelength of the neutrons:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the neutron.\n\nThe momentum of the neutron can be calculated as:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere m is the mass of the neutron and v is its velocity.\n\nThe mass of the neutron in kg can be calculated by converting the atomic mass unit (u) to kg:\n\n1 u = 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg\n\nm = 1.008665 u * 1.66053906660 x 10^-27 kg/u = 1.675 x 10^-27 kg (approximately)\n\nNow, we can calculate the momentum:\n\np = (1.675 x 10^-27 kg) * (2000 m/s) = 3.35 x 10^-24 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can find the de Broglie wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (3.35 x 10^-24 kg m/s) = 1.98 x 10^-10 m = 0.198 nm\n\n2. Now, let's use Bragg's law to find the scattering angle:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer (order of diffraction), λ is the wavelength, d is the lattice spacing, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nWe are given the scattering angle (30 degrees) and the lattice spacing (0.5 nm). We need to find the order of diffraction (n) that satisfies Bragg's law:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nn(0.198 nm) = 2(0.5 nm) * sin(30°)\n\nn(0.198 nm) = 2(0.5 nm) * 0.5\n\nn(0.198 nm) = 0.5 nm\n\nn = 0.5 nm / 0.198 nm ≈ 2.53\n\nSince n must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is 3.\n\nNow, we can plug the values back into Bragg's law to find the actual wavelength that satisfies the condition:\n\n3λ = 2(0.5 nm) * sin(30°)\n\n3λ = 0.5 nm\n\nλ = 0.5 nm / 3 ≈ 0.167 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of neutrons when they are scattered at an angle of 30 degrees by a crystal with a lattice spacing of 0.5 nm is approximately 0.167 nm."
