    "message_1": "A solution of ethanoic acid in water has a vapor pressure of 42.0 torr at 298 K. The vapor pressure of ethanoic acid is 74.0 torr at the same temperature. Determine the activity coefficient of ethanoic acid at this concentration.",
    "message_2": "To determine the activity coefficient of ethanoic acid at this concentration, we can use the relationship between the vapor pressure of the solution, the vapor pressure of the pure component, and the activity coefficient. This relationship is given by Raoult's Law:\n\nP_solution = x_A * γ_A * P_pure_A\n\nwhere P_solution is the vapor pressure of the solution, x_A is the mole fraction of ethanoic acid in the solution, γ_A is the activity coefficient of ethanoic acid, and P_pure_A is the vapor pressure of pure ethanoic acid.\n\nWe are given the vapor pressure of the solution (42.0 torr) and the vapor pressure of pure ethanoic acid (74.0 torr). We need to find the mole fraction of ethanoic acid in the solution (x_A) and the activity coefficient (γ_A).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange Raoult's Law to solve for the activity coefficient:\n\nγ_A = P_solution / (x_A * P_pure_A)\n\nWe are not given the mole fraction of ethanoic acid in the solution, but we can use the fact that the mole fraction of water (x_B) and the mole fraction of ethanoic acid (x_A) must add up to 1:\n\nx_A + x_B = 1\n\nSince the vapor pressure of water is much higher than that of ethanoic acid, we can assume that the mole fraction of ethanoic acid is small compared to that of water. Therefore, we can approximate the mole fraction of ethanoic acid as:\n\nx_A ≈ P_solution / P_pure_A\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x_A into the equation for the activity coefficient:\n\nγ_A ≈ P_solution / ((P_solution / P_pure_A) * P_pure_A)\n\nγ_A ≈ P_solution / P_solution\n\nγ_A ≈ 1\n\nSince the activity coefficient is approximately 1, this indicates that the ethanoic acid behaves as an ideal solution at this concentration."
