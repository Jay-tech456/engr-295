    "message_1": "A toroidal core has 500 turns of wire, inner radius of 3 cm, and outer radius of 5 cm. If the current flowing through the wire is 0.5 A, what is the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the toroid?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nIn this case, the closed loop is a circle with a radius of 2 cm, which is inside the toroid. Since the inner radius of the toroid is 3 cm, there is no current enclosed by the loop. Therefore, the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the toroid is 0 T (tesla)."
