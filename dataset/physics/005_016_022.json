    "message_2": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's first consider the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is given by the momentum of the electron, as the proton is initially at rest. The final momentum of the system is the sum of the momenta of the electron and proton after the collision.\n\nLet's denote the mass of the electron as m_e, the mass of the proton as m_p, the initial velocity of the electron as v_e, and the final velocities of the electron and proton as v'_e and v'_p, respectively.\n\nInitial momentum (p_initial) = m_e * v_e\nFinal momentum (p_final) = m_e * v'_e + m_p * v'_p\n\nSince momentum is conserved, p_initial = p_final:\n\nm_e * v_e = m_e * v'_e + m_p * v'_p  (1)\n\nNow let's consider the conservation of kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy of the system is given by the kinetic energy of the electron, as the proton is initially at rest. The final kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the electron and proton after the collision.\n\nInitial kinetic energy (KE_initial) = (1/2) * m_e * v_e^2\nFinal kinetic energy (KE_final) = (1/2) * m_e * v'_e^2 + (1/2) * m_p * v'_p^2\n\nSince kinetic energy is conserved, KE_initial = KE_final:\n\n(1/2) * m_e * v_e^2 = (1/2) * m_e * v'_e^2 + (1/2) * m_p * v'_p^2  (2)\n\nWe are given that the electron is traveling with a speed of 0.9c, where c is the speed of light. So, v_e = 0.9c.\n\nWe are asked to find the maximum kinetic energy of the proton after the collision, which is given by (1/2) * m_p * v'_p^2. To do this, we need to solve equations (1) and (2) for v'_p.\n\nFirst, let's solve equation (1) for v'_e:\n\nv'_e = (m_e * v_e - m_p * v'_p) / m_e\n\nNow, substitute this expression for v'_e into equation (2):\n\n(1/2) * m_e * v_e^2 = (1/2) * m_e * ((m_e * v_e - m_p * v'_p) / m_e)^2 + (1/2) * m_p * v'_p^2\n\nSimplify and solve for v'_p:\n\nv_e^2 = (m_e * v_e - m_p * v'_p)^2 / m_e^2 + v'_p^2\n\nv_e^2 * m_e^2 = (m_e * v_e - m_p * v'_p)^2 + m_e^2 * v'_p^2\n\nNow, we can make the assumption that the mass of the proton is much larger than the mass of the electron (m_p >> m_e). This allows us to simplify the equation further:\n\nv_e^2 * m_p^2 ≈ (m_p * v'_p)^2 + m_p^2 * v'_p^2\n\nv_e^2 ≈ v'_p^2 + v'_p^2\n\nv_e^2 ≈ 2 * v'_p^2\n\nv'_p^2 ≈ (1/2) * v_e^2\n\nv'_p ≈ sqrt((1/2) * v_e^2)\n\nNow we can find the maximum kinetic energy of the proton:\n\nKE_p = (1/2) * m_p * v'_p^2\n\nKE_p = (1/2) * m_p * ((1/2) * v_e^2)\n\nSince v_e = 0.9c, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nKE_p = (1/2) * m_p * ((1/2) * (0.9c)^2)\n\nKE_p = (1/2) * m_p * (0.81/2) * c^2\n\nThis is the maximum kinetic energy that the proton can have after the collision."
