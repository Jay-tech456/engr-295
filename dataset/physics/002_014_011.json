    "message_1": "A refrigerator takes in 500 joules of heat from its chilled compartment and expels 800 joules of heat to its warm compartment in 3 minutes. If the temperature in the chilled compartment is 5°C and the temperature in the warm compartment is 25°C, what is the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the chilled compartment (Q_c) to the work input (W) required to remove that heat. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nIn this problem, we are given the heat removed from the chilled compartment (Q_c = 500 J) and the heat expelled to the warm compartment (Q_h = 800 J). We can find the work input (W) by using the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total energy input is equal to the total energy output. In this case, the energy input is the work done by the refrigerator (W), and the energy output is the heat removed from the chilled compartment (Q_c) and the heat expelled to the warm compartment (Q_h).\n\nW = Q_h - Q_c\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nW = 800 J - 500 J = 300 J\n\nNow, we can find the coefficient of performance (COP) using the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nCOP = 500 J / 300 J = 5/3 ≈ 1.67\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is approximately 1.67."
