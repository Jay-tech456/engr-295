    "message_2": "To calculate the anomalous dimensions of chiral primary operators in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory using the holographic duality, we need to employ the AdS/CFT correspondence. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between a conformal field theory (CFT) and a string theory on an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the case of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, the dual string theory is Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \\times S^5$.\n\nHere's an outline of the steps to calculate the anomalous dimensions:\n\n1. Identify the chiral primary operators in the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. These operators are in one-to-one correspondence with the states of the string theory on $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. Chiral primary operators are BPS-protected and have a scaling dimension equal to their R-charge.\n\n2. Determine the dual string theory states corresponding to the chiral primary operators. These states are typically described by supergravity modes in the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ background.\n\n3. Calculate the scaling dimensions of the chiral primary operators using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The scaling dimensions can be obtained from the energy of the dual string states in the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ background. According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, the scaling dimension $\\Delta$ of a chiral primary operator is related to the energy $E$ of the corresponding string state by $\\Delta = E + 4$.\n\n4. In the case of chiral primary operators, their scaling dimensions are protected by supersymmetry and do not receive quantum corrections. Therefore, their anomalous dimensions, defined as the difference between the scaling dimension and the classical dimension, are zero.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the anomalous dimensions of chiral primary operators in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory using the holographic duality, we need to identify the corresponding string states in the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ background and compute their energies. However, due to the BPS protection, the anomalous dimensions of chiral primary operators are zero."
