    "message_2": "The hyperfine structure splitting of the ground state of neutral hydrogen is caused by the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and the proton. This interaction leads to a small energy difference between the parallel and antiparallel alignments of the electron and proton spins.\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) between these two states can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔE = (μ_B * g_p * μ_N * g_e * B) / h\n\nwhere μ_B is the Bohr magneton, g_p is the proton g-factor, μ_N is the nuclear magneton, g_e is the electron g-factor, B is the magnetic field at the nucleus due to the electron, and h is the Planck's constant.\n\nFor hydrogen, the values are:\n\nμ_B = 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\ng_p = 5.585\nμ_N = 5.051 x 10^-27 J/T\ng_e = 2.002\nB = 2.542 x 10^4 T (calculated using the formula B = (8 * π * μ_0 * μ_B * g_e) / (3 * h * a_0^3), where μ_0 is the vacuum permeability and a_0 is the Bohr radius)\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 * 5.585 * 5.051 x 10^-27 * 2.002 * 2.542 x 10^4) / (6.626 x 10^-34)\nΔE ≈ 5.87 x 10^-6 eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength (λ) of the emitted photon when the electron transitions between these two states using the formula:\n\nλ = (h * c) / ΔE\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 * 3 x 10^8) / (5.87 x 10^-6 * 1.602 x 10^-19)\nλ ≈ 0.211 x 10^-1 m or 21.1 cm\n\nComparing this calculated wavelength with the spectral lines observed in the 21 cm radio wave region, we can see that they are in good agreement. The hyperfine structure splitting of the ground state of neutral hydrogen is responsible for the 21 cm spectral line observed in radio astronomy."
