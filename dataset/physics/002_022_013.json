    "message_2": "The Debye-Hückel equation is used to estimate the activity coefficient (γ) of an electrolyte solution. For a 1:1 electrolyte like sodium chloride (NaCl), the Debye-Hückel equation can be written as:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * √I\n\nwhere A is the Debye-Hückel constant, I is the ionic strength of the solution, and γ is the activity coefficient.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the ionic strength (I) of the solution. For a 1:1 electrolyte like NaCl, the ionic strength can be calculated as:\n\nI = 1/2 * (c₁ * z₁² + c₂ * z₂²)\n\nwhere c₁ and c₂ are the concentrations of the cation (Na⁺) and anion (Cl⁻), respectively, and z₁ and z₂ are their respective charges. Since NaCl is a 1:1 electrolyte, the concentrations of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are equal to the concentration of NaCl (0.1 M), and their charges are +1 and -1, respectively. Therefore:\n\nI = 1/2 * (0.1 * 1² + 0.1 * (-1)²) = 0.1 / 2 = 0.05\n\nNext, we need to determine the value of the Debye-Hückel constant (A) at 25 °C. The value of A can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nA = 0.509 / √εr * T\n\nwhere εr is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of water at 25 °C, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The dielectric constant of water at 25 °C is approximately 78.4, and the temperature in Kelvin is 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K. Therefore:\n\nA = 0.509 / √(78.4 * 298.15) ≈ 0.509 / 15.34 ≈ 0.0332\n\nNow we can use the Debye-Hückel equation to calculate the activity coefficient:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * √I = -0.0332 * √0.05 ≈ -0.0074\n\nTo find the activity coefficient (γ), we take the antilogarithm (base 10) of the result:\n\nγ = 10^(-0.0074) ≈ 0.983\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of a 0.1 M sodium chloride solution at 25 °C is approximately 0.983."
