    "message_2": "The mechanical stress that a single strand of DNA can withstand before rupturing is typically measured in terms of force per cross-sectional area, or piconewtons per square nanometer (pN/nm²). The mechanical properties of DNA can vary depending on factors such as sequence, ionic conditions, and temperature.\n\nExperimental studies have shown that the rupture force for a single strand of DNA is in the range of 10-20 piconewtons (pN). The diameter of a DNA strand is about 2 nanometers (nm), so its cross-sectional area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle (A = πr²), where r is the radius (1 nm):\n\nA = π(1 nm)² ≈ 3.14 nm²\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum mechanical stress (σ) that a single strand of DNA can withstand before rupturing using the formula:\n\nσ = Force / Area\n\nUsing the range of rupture forces (10-20 pN) and the cross-sectional area (3.14 nm²):\n\nσ = (10-20 pN) / (3.14 nm²)\n\nσ ≈ 3.18 - 6.37 pN/nm²\n\nSo, the maximum amount of mechanical stress that a single strand of DNA can withstand before rupturing is approximately 3.18 - 6.37 piconewtons per square nanometer (pN/nm²)."
