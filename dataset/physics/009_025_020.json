    "message_2": "The numerical aperture (NA) of an optical fiber is related to the maximum angle of incidence (θ_max) that a light ray can enter the fiber by the following equation:\n\nNA = n * sin(θ_max)\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the fiber.\n\nWe are given the numerical aperture (NA = 0.5) and the refractive index (n = 1.5). We need to find the maximum angle of incidence (θ_max).\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ_max)\n\nTo find θ_max, we first need to find the value of sin(θ_max):\n\nsin(θ_max) = 0.5 / 1.5 = 1/3\n\nNow, we can find the maximum angle of incidence by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of sin(θ_max):\n\nθ_max = arcsin(1/3)\n\nθ_max ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle of incidence of a light ray that can enter the optical fiber is approximately 19.47 degrees."
