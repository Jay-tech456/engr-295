    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.8c towards a planet that is 10 light-years away. According to the spaceshipâ€™s clock, the journey takes 8 years. What is the time duration for an observer stationed on the planet, according to whom both the spaceship and the planet are stationary? Use Lorentz transformations to calculate the time dilation effect.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect, we can use the Lorentz transformation formula for time dilation:\n\nt = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time duration observed by the stationary observer on the planet, t0 is the time duration observed by the spaceship (8 years), v is the speed of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNow, we can find the square root of 0.36:\n\nsqrt(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, we can calculate the time duration observed by the stationary observer on the planet:\n\nt = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 8 years / 0.6 = 13.33 years\n\nSo, according to the observer stationed on the planet, the journey takes approximately 13.33 years."
