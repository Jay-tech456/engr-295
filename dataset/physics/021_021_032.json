    "message_2": "All black holes can emit Hawking radiation, regardless of their mass. Hawking radiation is a theoretical process by which black holes can lose mass over time due to quantum effects near the event horizon. The rate at which a black hole emits Hawking radiation is inversely proportional to its mass. This means that smaller black holes emit Hawking radiation at a higher rate than larger ones.\n\nNow, let's discuss the impact of Hawking radiation on the hypothesis that black holes could be a source of dark matter. Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it extremely difficult to detect. One of the proposed candidates for dark matter is primordial black holes, which are black holes that formed in the early universe.\n\nHowever, the existence of Hawking radiation imposes constraints on the mass range of primordial black holes that could serve as dark matter candidates. If a black hole is too small, it will evaporate quickly due to Hawking radiation, making it an unlikely candidate for dark matter. On the other hand, if a black hole is too massive, it would have observable effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, which have not been observed.\n\nCurrent observational constraints suggest that primordial black holes with masses between 10^(-10) solar masses and 10 solar masses could potentially serve as dark matter candidates. However, it is important to note that there is still no direct evidence for the existence of primordial black holes, and alternative dark matter candidates, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), are also being investigated."
