    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens at different distances from the optical axis do not converge at the same point. This can lead to a blurry image. To quantify the amount of spherical aberration, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔf = (k * R^3) / (8 * n * f^2)\n\nwhere Δf is the amount of spherical aberration, k is a constant that depends on the lens shape (for a plano-convex lens, k = 1), R is the aperture radius, n is the refractive index of the lens material, and f is the focal length.\n\nHowever, we do not have the refractive index (n) of the lens material in the given problem. If you can provide the refractive index, we can calculate the amount of spherical aberration."
