    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger on board the spaceship, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length as measured by the stationary observer on Earth, L0 is the proper length as measured by the passenger on board the spaceship, v is the relative velocity between the spaceship and the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given L (80 meters), v (0.6c), and c. We need to solve for L0.\n\n80 = L0 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\n\n80 = L0 * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\n80 = L0 * sqrt(0.64)\n\nNow, we can solve for L0:\n\nL0 = 80 / sqrt(0.64)\n\nL0 â‰ˆ 100 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as measured by a passenger on board the spaceship is approximately 100 meters."
