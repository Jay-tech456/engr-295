    "message_2": "Cooper pairs form in superconductors through a process called the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory, which explains the microscopic mechanism behind superconductivity. In a superconductor, electrons that would normally repel each other due to their negative charges can overcome this repulsion and form bound pairs called Cooper pairs. This pairing is facilitated by the interaction between electrons and the lattice vibrations (phonons) in the superconducting material.\n\nWhen an electron moves through the lattice, it attracts nearby positively charged ions, creating a region of higher positive charge density. This region, in turn, attracts another electron, leading to the formation of a Cooper pair. The two electrons in a Cooper pair are not necessarily close to each other in real space, but they are correlated in momentum space. This attractive interaction between the two electrons mediated by lattice vibrations is what allows them to form a bound state.\n\nThe significance of Cooper pair formation in the phenomenon of superconductivity lies in the fact that these pairs of electrons can move through the superconducting material without any resistance. This is because the Cooper pairs condense into a single quantum state called the BCS ground state, which is separated from higher energy states by an energy gap. This energy gap prevents the Cooper pairs from scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations, allowing them to move through the material without losing energy.\n\nWhen a superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature, a macroscopic number of Cooper pairs form and condense into the BCS ground state, resulting in the superconducting phase. In this phase, the material exhibits zero electrical resistance and can carry a current indefinitely without any energy loss. This unique property of superconductivity has significant implications for various applications, such as powerful electromagnets, energy-efficient power transmission, and advanced computing technologies like quantum computers."
