    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, an alpha particle (helium nucleus) with charge +2e and mass m_α is scattered by a gold nucleus with charge +79e. The angle through which the alpha particle is scattered is given by θ. In this case, θ = 120 degrees.\n\nThe minimum kinetic energy required for the alpha particle to pass through this angle can be found using the formula for the impact parameter (b) and the distance of closest approach (R_min) in Rutherford scattering.\n\nThe impact parameter (b) is given by:\n\nb = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nwhere k is the Coulomb constant (8.9875 × 10^9 Nm^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the alpha particle and gold nucleus respectively, K is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nThe distance of closest approach (R_min) is given by:\n\nR_min = (k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K)\n\nWe can set up an equation relating b and R_min:\n\nb = R_min * tan(θ/2)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for b and R_min and solve for K:\n\n(k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K * sin^2(θ/2)) = ((k * q1 * q2) / (2 * K)) * tan(θ/2)\n\nSimplifying and solving for K:\n\nK = (q1 * q2 * tan(θ/2)) / (2 * sin^2(θ/2))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nq1 = +2e = +2 * 1.602 × 10^-19 C\nq2 = +79e = +79 * 1.602 × 10^-19 C\nθ = 120 degrees = (2 * π / 3) radians\n\nK = (2 * 1.602 × 10^-19 C * 79 * 1.602 × 10^-19 C * tan(2 * π / 3)) / (2 * sin^2(2 * π / 3))\n\nK ≈ 1.02 × 10^-14 J\n\nSo, the minimum kinetic energy required for an alpha particle to pass through an angle of 120 degrees in the Rutherford scattering experiment is approximately 1.02 × 10^-14 J."
