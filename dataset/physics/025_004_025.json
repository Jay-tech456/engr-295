    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we need the following information:\n\n1. The standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction.\n2. The concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\nGlucose + ATP → Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction is typically around -16.7 kJ/mol at 25°C. However, this value can vary slightly depending on the source. Please confirm the value for your specific problem.\n\nNext, we need the concentrations of the reactants and products. Let's assume the following concentrations:\n\n[Glucose] = [G] = 1 mM\n[ATP] = [A] = 1 mM\n[Glucose-6-phosphate] = [G6P] = 0.1 mM\n[ADP] = [D] = 0.1 mM\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) using the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nWhere:\nΔG° = Standard Gibbs free energy change (-16.7 kJ/mol)\nR = Gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\nT = Temperature (25°C = 298 K)\nQ = Reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants\n\nQ = ([G6P][D]) / ([G][A])\n\nUsing the given concentrations:\n\nQ = (0.1 * 0.1) / (1 * 1) = 0.01\n\nNow, we can calculate ΔG:\n\nΔG = -16.7 kJ/mol + (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K) * ln(0.01)\n\nConvert R to kJ/mol·K:\n\nR = 8.314 J/mol·K * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 0.008314 kJ/mol·K\n\nΔG = -16.7 kJ/mol + (0.008314 kJ/mol·K * 298 K) * ln(0.01)\n\nΔG ≈ -16.7 kJ/mol + (2.478 kJ/mol) * ln(0.01)\n\nΔG ≈ -16.7 kJ/mol - 11.4 kJ/mol\n\nΔG ≈ -28.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction that converts glucose and ATP to glucose-6-phosphate and ADP at 25°C is approximately -28.1 kJ/mol. This negative value indicates that the reaction is spontaneous under the given conditions."
