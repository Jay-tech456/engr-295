    "message_2": "To calculate the entropy change for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nwhere ΔS is the entropy change, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, R is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K for this equation), and T is the temperature. We can rearrange the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nUsing the initial volume (V1 = 2 L), the pressure (P = 2 atm), and the temperature (T = 300 K):\n\nn = (2 atm * 2 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K) = 0.163 mol\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy change using the formula:\n\nΔS = n * R * ln(V2/V1)\n\nΔS = 0.163 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * ln(10 L / 2 L)\n\nΔS = 0.163 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * ln(5)\n\nΔS ≈ 0.163 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * 1.609\n\nΔS ≈ 2.17 J/K\n\nThe entropy change for the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 2.17 J/K."
