    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for human glucose metabolism through glycolysis, we need to know the standard free energy change (∆G°) for each of the 10 reactions in the pathway. The standard free energy change values for the 10 reactions in glycolysis are as follows:\n\n1. Hexokinase: ∆G° = -16.7 kJ/mol\n2. Phosphoglucose isomerase: ∆G° = 1.7 kJ/mol\n3. Phosphofructokinase: ∆G° = -14.2 kJ/mol\n4. Aldolase: ∆G° = 23.8 kJ/mol\n5. Triosephosphate isomerase: ∆G° = 7.3 kJ/mol\n6. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: ∆G° = -18.5 kJ/mol\n7. Phosphoglycerate kinase: ∆G° = -18.8 kJ/mol\n8. Phosphoglycerate mutase: ∆G° = 4.4 kJ/mol\n9. Enolase: ∆G° = 7.3 kJ/mol\n10. Pyruvate kinase: ∆G° = -31.4 kJ/mol\n\nUnder physiological conditions (37°C, pH 7.4, and concentrations of 1 M for all reactants and products), the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆G° + RT ln(Q)\n\nWhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (310.15 K), and Q is the reaction quotient, which is equal to the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants.\n\nSince the concentrations of all reactants and products are 1 M, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to 1. Therefore, the natural logarithm of Q (ln(Q)) is equal to 0, and the equation simplifies to:\n\n∆G = ∆G°\n\nNow, we can sum up the standard free energy changes for all 10 reactions in the glycolysis pathway:\n\n∆G_total = ∑ ∆G° = -16.7 + 1.7 - 14.2 + 23.8 + 7.3 - 18.5 - 18.8 + 4.4 + 7.3 - 31.4\n\n∆G_total = -44.1 kJ/mol\n\nThus, the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for human glucose metabolism through glycolysis under physiological conditions is -44.1 kJ/mol."
