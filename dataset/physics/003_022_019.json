    "message_1": "A motor with a length of 20 cm, a width of 10 cm and a height of 5 cm has a current of 2.5 A flowing through it. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 3 cm away from the center of the motor along its central axis. The motor has 25 turns of wire and a relative permeability of 1200.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 3 cm away from the center of the motor along its central axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field produced by a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * μ_r * N * I / L\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), μ_r is the relative permeability, N is the number of turns of wire, I is the current, and L is the length of the solenoid.\n\nGiven the values:\nμ_r = 1200\nN = 25 turns\nI = 2.5 A\nL = 20 cm = 0.2 m\n\nFirst, we need to find the total permeability (μ) by multiplying the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the relative permeability (μ_r):\n\nμ = μ₀ * μ_r\nμ = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 1200\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = μ * N * I / L\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 1200) * (25 * 2.5 A) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ 0.0471 T (Tesla)\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 3 cm away from the center of the motor along its central axis is approximately 0.0471 T."
