    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nA gas with an initial pressure of 2 atm and volume of 4 L undergoes an adiabatic expansion to a final volume of 8 L. The gas is not allowed to exchange heat with its surroundings during this process. Calculate the adiabatic work done by the gas during the expansion, assuming the gas follows an ideal gas law with a constant heat capacity ratio of 1.4.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the following equations and relationships for an adiabatic process:\n\n1. The ideal gas law: PV = nRT\n2. The adiabatic process equation: P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ, where γ is the heat capacity ratio\n3. The work done during an adiabatic process: W = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the final pressure (P2) using the adiabatic process equation:\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n2 atm * (4 L)^1.4 = P2 * (8 L)^1.4\n\nSolve for P2:\n\nP2 = (2 atm * (4 L)^1.4) / (8 L)^1.4\nP2 ≈ 0.942 atm\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion using the third equation:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\nW = (2 atm * 4 L - 0.942 atm * 8 L) / (1.4 - 1)\nW ≈ -5.88 L*atm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas (expansion), as opposed to work being done on the gas (compression). Therefore, the adiabatic work done by the gas during the expansion is approximately -5.88 L*atm."
