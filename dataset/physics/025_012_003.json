    "message_2": "The change in free energy (ΔG) when a protein-ligand binding reaction occurs at a constant temperature and pressure can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy (heat absorbed or released during the reaction), T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy (the degree of randomness or disorder in the system).\n\nIn the context of protein-ligand binding, ΔH represents the difference in enthalpy between the bound and unbound states, while ΔS represents the difference in entropy between the bound and unbound states. The change in free energy (ΔG) will determine the spontaneity of the binding reaction. If ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous and the protein-ligand complex will form. If ΔG is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous and the complex will not form. If ΔG is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium, and the rate of complex formation is equal to the rate of complex dissociation."
