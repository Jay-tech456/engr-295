    "message_1": "A student wants to design an optical fibre cable that can transmit light signals underwater. Determine the minimum angle of incidence at which a light ray entering the fibre from water will be totally internally reflected if the refractive index of water is 1.33 and the refractive index of the fibre core is 1.45.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (water and fibre core), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of refraction (θ2) must be 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(θ2) = sin(90) = 1.\n\nNow we can rearrange Snell's Law to find the minimum angle of incidence (θ1):\n\nsin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2) / n1\n\nPlugging in the given refractive indices:\n\nsin(θ1) = (1.45 * 1) / 1.33\nsin(θ1) ≈ 1.0902\n\nSince the sine function cannot be greater than 1, there is no minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection to occur in this case. This means that the light will always be refracted and will not be totally internally reflected within the optical fibre. The student may need to consider using a different material for the fibre core with a higher refractive index or explore alternative methods for transmitting light signals underwater."
