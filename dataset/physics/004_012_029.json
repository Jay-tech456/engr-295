    "message_2": "To calculate the cosmological scale factor at the present time, we need to use the Friedmann equation for a flat universe. The Friedmann equation is given by:\n\nH^2 = (8 * π * G * ρ) / 3\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, and ρ is the average density of matter in the universe.\n\nAt present time, we can use the Hubble constant (H0) as the Hubble parameter. The current value of the Hubble constant is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. To use it in the Friedmann equation, we need to convert it to SI units (m/s/m):\n\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc * (1000 m/km) / (3.086 × 10^22 m/Mpc) ≈ 2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow we can plug the given average density of matter (ρ = 10^-26 kg/m^3) and the Hubble constant (H0) into the Friedmann equation:\n\n(2.268 × 10^-18 s^-1)^2 = (8 * π * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2) * (10^-26 kg/m^3)) / 3\n\nSolving for the cosmological scale factor (a), we get:\n\na = 1\n\nThis means that the cosmological scale factor at the present time is 1, which is consistent with the definition of the scale factor, where a(t0) = 1 at the present time."
