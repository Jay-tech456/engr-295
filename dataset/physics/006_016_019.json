    "message_2": "To calculate the NMR frequency, we can use the Larmor equation:\n\nν = (γ / 2π) * B\n\nwhere ν is the NMR frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (which relates the magnetic moment μ to the angular momentum), and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nFirst, we need to find the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) using the magnetic moment (μ) and the angular momentum (I). The relationship between these quantities is given by:\n\nμ = γ * I\n\nSince we are not given the angular momentum, we can use the proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field strength to find the NMR frequency:\n\nν = (μ / 2π) * (1 / B)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nμ = 2.5 μN = 2.5 * 10^(-6) N\nB = 1.5 T\n\nν = (2.5 * 10^(-6) N / 2π) * (1 / 1.5 T)\n\nν ≈ (2.5 * 10^(-6) / (2 * 3.14159)) * (1 / 1.5)\n\nν ≈ 2.65 * 10^5 Hz\n\nTo express the answer in megahertz (MHz), we can convert the frequency:\n\nν ≈ 2.65 * 10^5 Hz * (1 MHz / 10^6 Hz)\n\nν ≈ 0.265 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR frequency of the atom is approximately 0.265 MHz."
