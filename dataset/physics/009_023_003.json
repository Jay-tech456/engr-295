    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the polarization of light passing through a polarizer. They have a light source that emits unpolarized light, a polarizer with an axis at 45 degrees to the incoming unpolarized light, and a detector to measure the intensity of the transmitted light. Using Malus' Law, calculate the transmission coefficient of the polarizer if the intensity of the transmitted light is 20% of the incident light.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of transmitted light (I_t) through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_i is the intensity of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the incoming unpolarized light and the polarizer's axis is 45 degrees (θ = 45°). Since the light source emits unpolarized light, the average value of cos²(θ) for unpolarized light is 1/2. Therefore, the intensity of the light after passing through the polarizer can be calculated as:\n\nI_t = I_i * (1/2)\n\nThe problem states that the intensity of the transmitted light is 20% of the incident light:\n\nI_t = 0.2 * I_i\n\nNow, we can set the two equations for I_t equal to each other and solve for the transmission coefficient:\n\n0.2 * I_i = I_i * (1/2)\n\nDivide both sides by I_i:\n\n0.2 = 1/2\n\nThe transmission coefficient of the polarizer is 0.2 or 20%."
