    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The magnetic field due to a small current element is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the current element, θ is the angle between the current element and the position vector, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.\n\nFor a square loop, we can consider each side separately and then sum up the magnetic fields due to each side. Since the current is flowing in the clockwise direction, we can use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The distance from the center of the loop to the midpoint of the side is half the side length (0.05 m). The angle θ between the current element and the position vector is 45 degrees for the two ends of the side and 90 degrees for the midpoint. We can divide the side into small segments and integrate the magnetic field due to each segment.\n\nFor simplicity, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side and then multiply the result by 4 since the loop is symmetrical. The magnetic field due to one side can be calculated as:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * a) / (4 * π * (a/2)²)\n\nwhere a is the side length of the square loop (0.1 m).\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m) / (4 * π * (0.05 m)²)\nB_side ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSince there are 4 sides, the total magnetic field at the center of the loop is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\nB_total ≈ 6.4 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the square loop and pointing downwards, as determined by the right-hand rule.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 6.4 × 10^(-5) T, and the direction is downward."
