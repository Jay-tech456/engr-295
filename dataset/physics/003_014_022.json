    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire, of dimensions 10 cm x 20 cm, carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at its center caused by the loop? (Assume that the wire is thin, so that its thickness can be neglected.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop has a rectangular shape, we can break it down into four straight segments and find the magnetic field due to each segment at the center, then sum them up.\n\nLet's label the four segments as follows: AB (10 cm), BC (20 cm), CD (10 cm), and DA (20 cm). The center of the rectangle is equidistant from all four segments. Let's denote the distance from the center to the shorter segments (AB and CD) as R1 and the distance from the center to the longer segments (BC and DA) as R2.\n\nSince the center is equidistant from all segments, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find R1 and R2:\n\nR1 = √((10/2)^2 + (20/2)^2) = √(5^2 + 10^2) = √125 cm\nR2 = √((20/2)^2 + (10/2)^2) = √(10^2 + 5^2) = √125 cm\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field due to each segment at the center:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * R^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), dl is the length of the wire segment, and R is the distance from the center to the segment.\n\nFor segments AB and CD (shorter segments):\n\ndB1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 cm) / (4 * π * (125 cm)^2)\ndB1 = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 cm) / (4 * π * 125^2 cm^2)\ndB1 = (2 × 10^(-6) T) / 125 cm\n\nFor segments BC and DA (longer segments):\n\ndB2 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 20 cm) / (4 * π * (125 cm)^2)\ndB2 = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 20 cm) / (4 * π * 125^2 cm^2)\ndB2 = (4 × 10^(-6) T) / 125 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the direction of the magnetic field due to each segment using the right-hand rule. For segments AB and CD, the magnetic field is in the horizontal plane, and for segments BC and DA, the magnetic field is in the vertical plane. Since the magnetic fields due to AB and CD are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they will cancel each other out.\n\nThe net magnetic field at the center is due to segments BC and DA:\n\nB_net = 2 * dB2 = 2 * (4 × 10^(-6) T) / 125 cm\nB_net = 8 × 10^(-6) T / 125 cm\nB_net ≈ 6.4 × 10^(-8) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is vertically upwards due to segment BC and vertically downwards due to segment DA. Since they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they will also cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the net magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is approximately 0 T."
