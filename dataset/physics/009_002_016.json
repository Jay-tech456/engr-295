    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two materials, θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1.00 (air), n2 = 1.50 (the other material), and θ1 = 35 degrees. We want to find θ2.\n\n1.00 * sin(35°) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(35°) = 1.50 * sin(θ2) / 1.00\n\nsin(35°) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.50:\n\nsin(35°) / 1.50 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(35°) / 1.50)\n\nθ2 ≈ 21.8 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 21.8 degrees."
