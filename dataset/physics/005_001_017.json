    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time elapsed on Earth (the observer's frame), Δt0 is the time elapsed on the spaceship (the moving frame), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.8c relative to Earth, and the clock on the spaceship reads 10 years. We want to find the time elapsed on Earth according to an observer on the spaceship.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given values into the time dilation equation:\n\nΔt = 10 years / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt = 10 years / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt = 10 years / sqrt(0.36)\n\nΔt = 10 years / 0.6\n\nΔt ≈ 16.67 years\n\nSo, according to an observer on the spaceship, approximately 16.67 years have elapsed on Earth."
