    "message_1": "What is the approximate amount of energy (in joules) emitted by a supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves, given its distance from Earth and the amplitude of the detected waveform?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the energy emitted by a supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves, we need more information than just the distance from Earth and the amplitude of the detected waveform. We also need to know the mass and radius of the collapsing star, as well as the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general formula to calculate the energy emitted in gravitational waves. The energy emitted by a supernova explosion in the form of gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * R) / c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the collapsing star, R is the radius of the collapsing star, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo get a more accurate estimation, you would need to integrate this formula over the entire duration of the supernova explosion, taking into account the changing mass and radius of the collapsing star, as well as the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the supernova, such as the mass and radius of the collapsing star and the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves, I can help you calculate a more accurate estimate of the energy emitted in gravitational waves."
