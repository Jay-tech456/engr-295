    "message_2": "To determine the magnification of the object, we first need to find the image distance using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo find the common denominator, we can multiply both sides by 60di:\n\n3di = 2di + 60\n\nNow, subtract 2di from both sides:\n\ndi = 60 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the object is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object."
