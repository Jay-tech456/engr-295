    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the spaceship as seen by an observer on Earth, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length as seen by the observer on Earth, L0 is the proper length of the spaceship in its own frame of reference (60 meters), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nL = 60 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2 / c^2)\n\nL = 60 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 60 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 60 * 0.6\n\nL = 36 meters\n\nSo, the length of the spaceship as seen by an observer on Earth is 36 meters."
