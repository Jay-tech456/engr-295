    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is the radius of the event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light. The formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 5 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 5 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 × 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s ≈ 1.47 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14,700 meters or 14.7 kilometers.\n\nThe significance of the event horizon at this radius for a particle trying to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole is that once the particle crosses the event horizon (i.e., it gets closer to the black hole than the Schwarzschild radius), it can no longer escape the black hole's gravitational pull. Even if the particle were to travel at the speed of light, it would still be unable to escape. This is why black holes are called \"black\" - they do not emit any light or radiation that can be detected from outside the event horizon."
