    "message_1": "A Physics student needs to calculate the amount of gravitational redshift that would occur if an object is located at the surface of a planet with twice the mass and half the radius of the Earth, assuming that the object emits light with a frequency of 500 MHz.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift, we can use the formula:\n\nΔf/f = GM/c²R\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, c is the speed of light, and R is the radius of the planet.\n\nGiven that the planet has twice the mass and half the radius of Earth, we can write:\n\nM = 2 * M_earth\nR = 0.5 * R_earth\n\nThe mass of Earth is approximately M_earth = 5.97 × 10^24 kg, and the radius of Earth is approximately R_earth = 6.371 × 10^6 m. The gravitational constant G = 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², and the speed of light c = 2.998 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\nΔf/f = (2 * 5.97 × 10^24 kg * 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)² * (0.5 * 6.371 × 10^6 m)\n\nΔf/f = (1.194 × 10^25 kg * 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) / (8.987 × 10^16 m²/s²) * (3.186 × 10^6 m)\n\nΔf/f = (7.971 × 10^14) / (8.987 × 10^16) * (3.186 × 10^6)\n\nΔf/f = 0.0887 * 3.186 × 10^6\n\nNow, we can find the change in frequency Δf:\n\nΔf = 0.0887 * 3.186 × 10^6 * 500 MHz\n\nΔf = 0.0887 * 3.186 × 10^6 * 500 × 10^6 Hz\n\nΔf ≈ 14.16 × 10^6 Hz\n\nSo, the gravitational redshift for an object located at the surface of the planet emitting light with a frequency of 500 MHz would be approximately 14.16 MHz."
