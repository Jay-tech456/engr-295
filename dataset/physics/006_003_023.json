    "message_2": "To calculate the splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field, we need to consider the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of a magnetic field. In this case, we are dealing with the normal Zeeman effect, as the initial and final states have the same l value.\n\nThe energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:\n\nΔE = μB * B * ΔmL\n\nwhere μB is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and ΔmL is the change in the magnetic quantum number (mL).\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μB) is a constant and is given by:\n\nμB = e * ħ / (2 * me)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.05 × 10^(-34) Js), and me is the electron mass (9.11 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nμB ≈ 9.27 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy shift:\n\nΔmL = mLf - mLi = -1 - (+1) = -2\n\nΔE = (9.27 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * (-2) = -9.27 × 10^(-24) J\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the energy level has shifted to a lower energy state.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency shift (Δν) using the energy shift:\n\nΔE = h * Δν\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.63 × 10^(-34) Js).\n\nΔν = ΔE / h = (-9.27 × 10^(-24) J) / (6.63 × 10^(-34) Js) ≈ -1.4 × 10^10 Hz\n\nNow, we can represent the results in a table:\n\nInitial State (n=3, l=1, ml=+1) | Final State (n=2, l=1, ml=-1) | Energy Shift (ΔE) | Frequency Shift (Δν)\n----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------\n          +1                       |         -1                       | -9.27 × 10^(-24) J | -1.4 × 10^10 Hz\n\nThe spectral line has split into two lines, with the initial state having an ml of +1 and the final state having an ml of -1. The energy shift is -9.27 × 10^(-24) J, and the frequency shift is -1.4 × 10^10 Hz."
