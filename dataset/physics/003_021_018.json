    "message_1": "A transformer has a primary coil of 200 turns and a secondary coil of 800 turns. The primary coil carries a current of 4 A. If the transformer is ideal, what is the magnetic field produced by the primary coil at a distance of 5 cm from its center?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field produced by the primary coil at a distance of 5 cm from its center, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since we are not given the length of the primary coil, we can assume it to be L meters. Therefore, n = 200 turns / L.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (200 turns / L) * 4 A\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (800π turns / L) \n\nHowever, we cannot calculate the exact value of the magnetic field without knowing the length of the primary coil (L). Additionally, the magnetic field produced by a solenoid is uniform inside the solenoid and drops significantly outside the solenoid. Since we are asked to find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the center, we need more information about the dimensions and shape of the primary coil to provide an accurate answer."
