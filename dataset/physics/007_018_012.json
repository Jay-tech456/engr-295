    "message_2": "To calculate the half-life of Strontium-90, we can use the formula:\n\nHalf-life (T) = ln(2) / decay constant (λ)\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2, and the decay constant (λ) is given as 0.00924 per year.\n\nT = ln(2) / 0.00924\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nT ≈ 75.06 years\n\nSo, the half-life of Strontium-90 is approximately 75.06 years."
