Use your knowledge of NMR spectroscopy and principles of chemical structure determination to deduce the chemical formula of the substance.",
    "message_2": "To deduce the chemical formula of the substance, we need to consider the information provided by the NMR spectrum:\n\n1. Chemical shift of 3.5 ppm: This value indicates the environment of the hydrogen atom in the molecule. A chemical shift of 3.5 ppm is typical for hydrogen atoms that are bonded to a carbon atom next to a carbonyl group (C=O) or an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n2. Triplet splitting pattern: This pattern suggests that the hydrogen atom in question has two neighboring hydrogen atoms that are not equivalent to itself. This is because the n+1 rule states that the number of peaks in a splitting pattern is equal to the number of neighboring, non-equivalent hydrogen atoms plus one.\n\n3. Coupling constant of 8 Hz: This value is typical for hydrogen atoms that are bonded to carbon atoms in an aliphatic chain (i.e., not part of an aromatic ring).\n\nTaking all of this information into account, we can deduce that the hydrogen atom is part of an aliphatic chain and is adjacent to a carbonyl group or an electronegative atom. One possible chemical formula that fits this description is CH3CH2COOH, which is the formula for propanoic acid (also known as propionic acid). In this molecule, the hydrogen atom bonded to the carbon atom next to the carbonyl group (C=O) would have a chemical shift of around 3.5 ppm, a triplet splitting pattern due to the two neighboring CH3 hydrogens, and a coupling constant of 8 Hz.\n\nIt's important to note that this is just one possible chemical formula that fits the given NMR data. Further analysis, such as examining other peaks in the NMR spectrum or using other spectroscopic techniques like IR or mass spectrometry, would be necessary to confirm the identity of the substance."
