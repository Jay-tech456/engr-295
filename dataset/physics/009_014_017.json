Given that the refractive indices for violet and red colors are 1.52 and 1.47 respectively. How much deviation will the violet and red rays undergo?",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic aberration in the glass prism, we need to calculate the angular deviation for both the violet and red rays. We can use the formula for the deviation angle (δ) in a prism:\n\nδ = (n - 1) * A\n\nwhere n is the refractive index and A is the prism angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prism angle (A). We can use Snell's Law at the first surface of the prism:\n\nn₁ * sin(θ₁) = n₂ * sin(θ₂)\n\nwhere n₁ is the refractive index of air (1), θ₁ is the angle of incidence (30 degrees), n₂ is the refractive index of the glass prism (1.5), and θ₂ is the angle of refraction inside the prism.\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ₂)\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ₂)\nsin(θ₂) = 0.5 / 1.5\nθ₂ = arcsin(0.3333) ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nNow, we can find the angle A using the formula:\n\nA = θ₁ - θ₂\nA = 30 - 19.47 ≈ 10.53 degrees\n\nNext, we can calculate the deviation angle for both the violet and red rays using the given refractive indices:\n\nδ_violet = (1.52 - 1) * 10.53 ≈ 5.48 degrees\nδ_red = (1.47 - 1) * 10.53 ≈ 4.93 degrees\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic aberration, which is the difference in deviation angles between the violet and red rays:\n\nChromatic aberration = δ_violet - δ_red\nChromatic aberration = 5.48 - 4.93 ≈ 0.55 degrees\n\nSo, the chromatic aberration in the glass prism is approximately 0.55 degrees. The violet ray will undergo a deviation of approximately 5.48 degrees, and the red ray will undergo a deviation of approximately 4.93 degrees."
