    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second medium, respectively, θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nn1 = 1.5\nn2 = 1.2\nθ1 = 30 degrees\n\nWe need to find θ2. First, let's find the sine of the incident angle:\n\nsin(θ1) = sin(30) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Snell's Law:\n\n1.5 * 0.5 = 1.2 * sin(θ2)\n\n0.75 = 1.2 * sin(θ2)\n\nTo find sin(θ2), divide both sides by 1.2:\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.75 / 1.2 = 0.625\n\nNow, we can find the angle of refraction by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of sin(θ2):\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.625)\n\nθ2 ≈ 38.21 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 38.21 degrees."
