    "message_2": "To estimate the time delay of a gravitational wave passing through a loop of cosmic string with a given radius, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Determine the length of the cosmic string loop: The length of the loop can be approximated as the circumference of a circle with the given radius. The formula for the circumference is C = 2 * Ï€ * R, where R is the radius of the loop.\n\n2. Calculate the speed of the gravitational wave: Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, which is approximately c = 3.0 x 10^8 meters per second.\n\n3. Estimate the time delay: The time delay can be calculated by dividing the length of the cosmic string loop by the speed of the gravitational wave. The formula for the time delay is t = C / c.\n\nUsing these steps, we can estimate the time delay of a gravitational wave passing through a loop of cosmic string with a given radius. Note that this is a simplified approach and more detailed calculations would require considering the specific properties of the cosmic string, such as its tension and energy density."
