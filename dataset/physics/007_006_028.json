    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of a neutron with a given kinetic energy, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the neutron.\n\nFirst, we need to find the momentum of the neutron. We can do this by using the kinetic energy formula:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the neutron, and v is the velocity of the neutron. The mass of a neutron is approximately 1.675 x 10^-27 kg, and the given kinetic energy is 2.5 MeV (which we need to convert to Joules).\n\n1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J\n\nSo, 2.5 MeV = 2.5 * 1.602 x 10^-13 J = 4.005 x 10^-13 J\n\nNow, we can solve for the velocity of the neutron:\n\n(1/2)(1.675 x 10^-27 kg)v^2 = 4.005 x 10^-13 J\n\nv^2 = (4.005 x 10^-13 J) / (0.5 * 1.675 x 10^-27 kg) = 4.788 x 10^14\n\nv = sqrt(4.788 x 10^14) = 6.919 x 10^7 m/s\n\nNow that we have the velocity, we can find the momentum:\n\np = mv = (1.675 x 10^-27 kg)(6.919 x 10^7 m/s) = 1.159 x 10^-19 kg m/s\n\nFinally, we can find the wavelength using the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (1.159 x 10^-19 kg m/s) = 5.715 x 10^-15 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the neutron is approximately 5.715 x 10^-15 m or 0.5715 fm (femtometers)."
