    "message_1": "A student needs to calculate the critical temperature of a certain substance, given its critical pressure and its van der Waals constants. The substance has a molar volume of 0.0283 m³/mol at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm). Using the van der Waals equation of state, determine the critical temperature of the substance.",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical temperature of the substance, we need to know its critical pressure (Pc) and van der Waals constants (a and b). The van der Waals equation of state is given by:\n\n(P + a/v²)(v - b) = RT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, v is the molar volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nAt the critical point, the following relationships hold:\n\nPc = a / (27 * b²)\nTc = (8 * a) / (27 * b * R)\n\nWe are given the molar volume (v) at standard conditions (25°C and 1 atm), but we need the van der Waals constants (a and b) and the critical pressure (Pc) to calculate the critical temperature (Tc).\n\nPlease provide the critical pressure and van der Waals constants for the substance, and I will help you calculate the critical temperature."
