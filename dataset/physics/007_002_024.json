    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive material has an initial activity of 1200 decays per second. After 10 minutes, the activity of the sample drops to 300 decays per second. What is the half-life of the material?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nA = A0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nA = final activity (300 decays per second)\nA0 = initial activity (1200 decays per second)\nt = time elapsed (10 minutes = 600 seconds)\nT = half-life of the material (which we want to find)\n\nFirst, we can divide both sides of the equation by A0:\n\nA/A0 = (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n300/1200 = (1/2)^(600/T)\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(600/T)\n\nTo solve for T, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n\nlog(0.25) = log((1/2)^(600/T))\n\nlog(0.25) = (600/T) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for T:\n\nT = 600 * log(1/2) / log(0.25)\n\nT ≈ 600 * (-0.30103) / (-0.60206)\n\nT ≈ 300 seconds\n\nThe half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 300 seconds."
