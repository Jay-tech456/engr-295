    "message_2": "To determine the critical temperature for the phase transition of a material from a solid to a liquid state under a given pressure range, you need to know the specific material and its properties. Each material has its own unique melting point, which is the temperature at which it transitions from a solid to a liquid state.\n\nFor example, the melting point of ice (water) is 0°C (32°F) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). However, this value can change under different pressure conditions. In general, increasing pressure will increase the melting point, while decreasing pressure will lower it.\n\nTo find the critical temperature for a specific material under a given pressure range, you can consult phase diagrams or material property databases. These resources provide information on the melting points and phase transitions of various materials under different pressure conditions.\n\nIf you have the necessary data, you can also use mathematical models, such as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, to estimate the critical temperature for a phase transition under specific pressure conditions. However, these models often require additional information, such as the enthalpy of fusion and the specific volume change during the phase transition."
