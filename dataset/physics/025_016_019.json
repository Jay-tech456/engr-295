    "message_2": "The standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP at body temperature (37°C) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG° = ΔG°' + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG°' is the standard free energy change under biochemical standard conditions (1 M concentrations, pH 7.0), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310.15 K), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nUnder biochemical standard conditions, the ΔG°' for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is approximately -30.5 kJ/mol. Since we are assuming standard conditions (1 M concentrations, pH 7.0), the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔG° = ΔG°'\n\nThus, the standard free energy change for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP at body temperature (37°C) and standard conditions (1 M concentrations, pH 7.0) is approximately -30.5 kJ/mol."
