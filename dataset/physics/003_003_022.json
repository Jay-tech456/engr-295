    "message_1": "A toroid has 200 turns of wire and a radius of 5 cm. If the toroid's inner radius is 3 cm and carries a current of 2 A, what is the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid 10 cm from the center?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Ampere's Law and the Biot-Savart Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nThe Biot-Savart Law relates the magnetic field (B) at a point in space to the current (I) flowing through a small segment of wire (dl) and the distance (r) between the point and the wire segment:\n\ndB = (μ₀I/4π) * (dl x r) / r³\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid 10 cm from the center.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance (r) from the point to the wire. Since the point is on the axis of the toroid and 10 cm from the center, the distance from the point to the wire is:\n\nr = sqrt((10 cm)² + (5 cm)²) = sqrt(125 cm²) = 5√5 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the total current enclosed by the loop. The toroid has 200 turns of wire, and each turn carries a current of 2 A, so the total current is:\n\nI_total = 200 turns * 2 A/turn = 400 A\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field at the point:\n\ndB = (μ₀I/4π) * (dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the point is on the axis of the toroid, the angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law around the toroid:\n\nB = ∮(μ₀I/4π) * (dl * r) / r³\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀I/4π) * (1/r²) * ∮dl\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the toroid is equal to the circumference of the toroid:\n\n∮dl = 2π * 5 cm = 10π cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀, I, and r:\n\nB = (4π * 10^(-7) T m/A * 400 A) / (4π) * (1/(5√5 cm)²) * 10π cm\n\nB = (1.6 * 10^(-4) T m²) / (125 cm²) * 10π cm\n\nB ≈ 4.03 * 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid 10 cm from the center is approximately 4.03 * 10^(-6) T."
