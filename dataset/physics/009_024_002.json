    "message_1": "A ray of unpolarized light is incident on a polarizer that transmits 40% of the incident intensity. What is the angle between the direction of polarization of the incident light and the axis of the polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use Malus' Law, which states that the transmitted intensity (I_t) of light through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the direction of polarization of the incident light and the axis of the polarizer:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere I_i is the incident intensity.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the polarizer transmits 40% of the incident intensity, so:\n\nI_t = 0.4 * I_i\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ. Since the incident light is unpolarized, we can assume that the average value of cos^2(θ) is 1/2 (because the average value of cos^2(θ) over all angles is 1/2 for unpolarized light). Therefore, we can write:\n\n0.4 * I_i = I_i * (1/2) * cos^2(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by I_i:\n\n0.4 = (1/2) * cos^2(θ)\n\nNow, solve for cos^2(θ):\n\ncos^2(θ) = 0.4 / (1/2) = 0.8\n\nTake the square root of both sides to find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = sqrt(0.8) ≈ 0.8944\n\nNow, find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine:\n\nθ = arccos(0.8944) ≈ 27.1°\n\nSo, the angle between the direction of polarization of the incident light and the axis of the polarizer is approximately 27.1°."
