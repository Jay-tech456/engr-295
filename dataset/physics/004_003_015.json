    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime, as described by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, plays a crucial role in determining the orbits of planets in our solar system. In this theory, massive objects like the Sun cause spacetime to curve around them, and this curvature influences the motion of nearby objects, such as planets.\n\nIn classical Newtonian physics, the force of gravity between two objects is determined by their masses and the distance between them. This force causes planets to move in elliptical orbits around the Sun. However, this classical description is not entirely accurate, as it does not account for the effects of spacetime curvature.\n\nIn General Relativity, the Sun's mass warps the spacetime around it, creating a \"gravity well.\" Planets move in orbits that are determined by the curvature of this spacetime, which can be thought of as the shortest path (geodesic) in the curved spacetime. These orbits are still approximately elliptical, but they exhibit some differences compared to the orbits predicted by Newtonian physics.\n\nOne notable difference is the precession of the perihelion, which is the point in a planet's orbit where it is closest to the Sun. In the case of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, the precession of its perihelion was observed to be slightly larger than what was predicted by Newtonian physics. This discrepancy was resolved by the General Theory of Relativity, which accurately predicted the observed precession due to the curvature of spacetime.\n\nAnother effect of spacetime curvature on planetary orbits is the bending of light by gravity, known as gravitational lensing. When light from a distant star passes close to a massive object like the Sun, its path is bent due to the curvature of spacetime. This effect was first observed during a solar eclipse in 1919, providing one of the first experimental confirmations of General Relativity.\n\nIn summary, the curvature of spacetime affects the orbits of planets in our solar system by causing them to follow geodesics in the curved spacetime around the Sun. This leads to phenomena such as the precession of the perihelion and gravitational lensing, which are accurately described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity."
