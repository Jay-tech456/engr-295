    "message_2": "The average distance of an asteroid in our solar system from the Sun depends on its location within the asteroid belt, which is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid belt has an average distance of about 2.7 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.\n\nThe size of the asteroid does not directly affect its distance from the Sun. Instead, the distance is determined by the asteroid's orbit, which is influenced by the gravitational forces from the Sun and other celestial bodies. Kepler's third law relates the semi-major axis (a) of an orbit to its orbital period (T) as follows:\n\nT^2 = a^3\n\nwhere T is the orbital period in Earth years and a is the semi-major axis in astronomical units (AU).\n\nSince the size of the asteroid does not affect its distance from the Sun, we can use Kepler's third law to calculate the average distance of an asteroid from the Sun based on its orbital period. For example, if we know the orbital period of an asteroid, we can find its semi-major axis (average distance from the Sun) using the formula:\n\na = (T^2)^(1/3)\n\nHowever, without specific information about the orbital period of an asteroid, we cannot calculate its distance from the Sun using Kepler's third law. In general, the size of the asteroid does not play a significant role in determining its distance from the Sun, as it is primarily determined by its orbit and the gravitational forces acting upon it."
