If the final temperature of the system is 25°C, what is the amount of heat transferred from the copper block to the water? (Assuming no heat loss to the surroundings)",
    "message_2": "To find the amount of heat transferred from the copper block to the water, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFor the copper block:\nmass (m) = 500 g\nspecific heat capacity (c) = 385 J/(kg·K) (for copper)\ninitial temperature (Ti) = 100°C\nfinal temperature (Tf) = 25°C\n\nΔT = Tf - Ti = 25°C - 100°C = -75°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat transferred from the copper block:\n\nQ_copper = mcΔT\nQ_copper = (500 g) * (385 J/(kg·K)) * (-75°C)\n\nSince the mass is given in grams, we need to convert it to kilograms:\n\n500 g = 0.5 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat transferred:\n\nQ_copper = (0.5 kg) * (385 J/(kg·K)) * (-75°C) = -14437.5 J\n\nSince the heat is transferred from the copper block to the water, the heat transferred to the water is the same in magnitude but opposite in sign:\n\nQ_water = 14437.5 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat transferred from the copper block to the water is 14437.5 J."
