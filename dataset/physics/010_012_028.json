    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the boundary layer, we need to use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The Blasius solution states that the boundary layer thickness (δ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / U))^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\n- δ is the boundary layer thickness\n- x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate\n- ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid\n- U is the free-stream velocity of the fluid\n\nWe are given that the velocity (U) is 10 m/s, and we need to find the boundary layer thickness at x = L/2. However, we do not have the value of the kinematic viscosity (ν) of the fluid. To proceed with the calculation, we need to know the value of ν.\n\nAssuming we have the value of ν, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nδ = (5 * (L/2) * (ν / 10))^(1/2)\n\nOnce we have the value of ν, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ) at x = L/2."
