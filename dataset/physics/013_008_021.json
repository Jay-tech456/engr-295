    "message_2": "The mechanism responsible for the emission of high-energy gamma rays in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is believed to be the rapid release of a massive amount of energy from a compact region in space, such as the core-collapse of a massive star or the merger of two compact objects (e.g., neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). These events result in the formation of a highly relativistic jet, which is a narrow, highly collimated stream of plasma moving at nearly the speed of light.\n\nAstrophysical models that explain the emission of high-energy gamma rays in GRBs include the fireball model and the internal-external shock model. Both models involve the interaction of the relativistic jet with the surrounding medium, leading to the acceleration of particles and the production of gamma rays.\n\n1. Fireball Model: In this model, the energy released during the core-collapse or merger event is converted into a fireball, which is a highly relativistic, optically thick plasma composed of photons, electrons, and positrons. As the fireball expands, it becomes optically thin, allowing the photons to escape and produce the observed gamma-ray emission. The fireball model can explain the basic features of GRBs, such as their short durations and high-energy spectra.\n\n2. Internal-External Shock Model: This model builds on the fireball model by considering the interaction of the relativistic jet with the surrounding medium. The jet is assumed to have a variable velocity, which leads to internal shocks within the jet as faster-moving material catches up with slower-moving material. These internal shocks can accelerate particles and produce high-energy gamma rays through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, the jet can also interact with the external medium, producing an external shock that can further accelerate particles and contribute to the gamma-ray emission.\n\nIn summary, the emission of high-energy gamma rays in GRBs is thought to be the result of the rapid release of energy from a compact region in space, leading to the formation of a relativistic jet. Astrophysical models, such as the fireball model and the internal-external shock model, explain the gamma-ray emission by considering the expansion of the fireball and the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium, which leads to the acceleration of particles and the production of gamma rays."
