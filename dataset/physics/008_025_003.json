    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, which is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Its decay modes and branching ratios depend on its mass, which is approximately 125 GeV/c².\n\nThe main decay modes of the Higgs boson are:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quarks (H -> bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks.\n\n2. Higgs to W bosons (H -> WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons, which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos or quarks.\n\n3. Higgs to tau leptons (H -> ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of tau leptons.\n\n4. Higgs to charm quarks (H -> cc): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.9%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of charm quarks.\n\n5. Higgs to Z bosons (H -> ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons, which subsequently decay into leptons or quarks.\n\n6. Higgs to gluons (H -> gg): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 8.6%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual top quarks.\n\n7. Higgs to gamma photons (H -> γγ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of gamma photons through a loop of virtual W bosons or top quarks.\n\n8. Higgs to muons (H -> μμ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.02%. The Higgs boson decays into a pair of muons.\n\n9. Higgs to Z and gamma (H -> Zγ): This is a rare decay mode with a branching ratio of about 0.01%. The Higgs boson decays into a Z boson and a gamma photon.\n\nThe properties of the Higgs boson, such as its mass, spin, and parity, can be inferred from the decay products and their kinematic distributions.\n\nData from the LHC is used to study and confirm these decay modes by analyzing the collisions of protons at high energies. The Higgs boson is produced in these collisions and subsequently decays into various particles. By reconstructing the decay products and their properties, physicists can identify the presence of the Higgs boson and measure its properties.\n\nThe ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have observed and measured several of the Higgs boson decay modes, including H -> γγ, H -> ZZ, H -> WW, and H -> ττ. These observations have provided crucial evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson and have allowed for precise measurements of its mass and other properties. Further studies of the Higgs boson and its decay modes will continue to improve our understanding of the Higgs mechanism and the fundamental nature of the universe."
