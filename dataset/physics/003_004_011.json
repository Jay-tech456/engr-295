    "message_1": "A circular wire loop with a radius of 0.1 meters carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, precisely at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along its axis.\n\nSince we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, x = 0. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0.1 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.01 m²) / (0.01 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π x 10^(-7) T) / (0.01 m)\n\nB = 8π x 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 2.51 x 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
