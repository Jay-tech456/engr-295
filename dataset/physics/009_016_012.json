    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the first minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3))\nsin(θ) = 5 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(5 * 10^(-6))\n\nThe distance between the slit and the screen is given as 2 meters. We can use the small-angle approximation to find the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum on the screen:\n\ndistance = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slit and the screen.\n\ndistance = 2 * arcsin(5 * 10^(-6))\ndistance ≈ 2 * (5 * 10^(-6))\ndistance ≈ 10 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo the distance between the central maximum and the first minimum on the screen is approximately 10 * 10^(-6) meters, or 10 μm."
