    "message_2": "The relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and its effect on biological systems can be understood through the concept of energy absorption and interaction with living tissues. Electromagnetic radiation covers a wide range of frequencies, from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency gamma rays. The energy of electromagnetic radiation is directly proportional to its frequency, as described by the equation:\n\nE = h × f\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the radiation.\n\nThe effect of electromagnetic radiation on biological systems depends on the frequency and energy of the radiation. Here's a brief overview of how different frequency ranges interact with living organisms:\n\n1. Extremely low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency (RF) radiation: These low-energy, non-ionizing radiations have frequencies ranging from 3 Hz to 300 GHz. They can cause thermal effects and heating of tissues when absorbed by the body. Prolonged exposure to high levels of RF radiation may lead to tissue damage, but the risk is generally low at typical environmental levels.\n\n2. Microwaves: With frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz, microwaves are also non-ionizing radiation. They can cause dielectric heating in water-containing tissues, which can lead to burns or other thermal injuries. However, at low levels, such as those emitted by microwave ovens or cell phones, the risk of harmful effects is minimal.\n\n3. Infrared (IR) radiation: Infrared radiation has frequencies between 300 GHz and 430 THz. It is mainly responsible for the sensation of heat and can cause thermal effects on the skin and eyes. Prolonged exposure to high levels of IR radiation can lead to burns and eye damage.\n\n4. Visible light: With frequencies between 430 THz and 750 THz, visible light is essential for vision and various biological processes, such as photosynthesis in plants. However, excessive exposure to intense visible light can cause damage to the eyes and skin.\n\n5. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation: Ultraviolet radiation has frequencies between 750 THz and 30 PHz. It is divided into three categories: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVA and UVB can penetrate the skin and cause damage to DNA, leading to sunburn, skin aging, and increased risk of skin cancer. UVC is mostly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and does not reach the surface.\n\n6. X-rays and gamma rays: These high-energy, ionizing radiations have frequencies above 30 PHz. They can penetrate tissues and cause ionization of atoms and molecules, leading to damage to DNA and other cellular components. Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer and other health issues.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and its effect on biological systems is complex and depends on the energy and penetration capabilities of the radiation. Lower frequency, non-ionizing radiations generally cause thermal effects, while higher frequency, ionizing radiations can cause damage at the molecular level, increasing the risk of various health issues."
