    "message_2": "The critical temperature for the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is approximately 2 x 10^12 Kelvin, or around 170 MeV (Mega-electron volts) in terms of energy. This value is derived from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations.\n\nThe formation of QGP depends on both temperature and energy density. As the collision energy increases, the energy density in the system also increases, which can lead to the formation of QGP at lower temperatures. However, the relationship between collision energy and the critical temperature is not straightforward, as it depends on various factors such as the size of the colliding nuclei, the impact parameter, and the initial state of the system.\n\nIn general, higher collision energies lead to higher initial temperatures and energy densities, which can result in the formation of QGP at lower critical temperatures. However, the exact dependence of the critical temperature on collision energy is still an active area of research in high-energy nuclear physics."
