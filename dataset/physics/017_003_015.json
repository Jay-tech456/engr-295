    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of the material, we can use the Fresnel equations for reflectance at the interface between two media. The reflectance (R) for light incident at normal incidence (0 degrees) on the interface between two media with refractive indices n1 and n2 is given by:\n\nR = ((n1 - n2) / (n1 + n2))^2\n\nIn this case, the reflectance R is given as 22% or 0.22, and the incident medium is air, which has a refractive index n1 ≈ 1. We can solve for the refractive index n2 (the material's refractive index) using the equation:\n\n0.22 = ((1 - n2) / (1 + n2))^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(0.22) = (1 - n2) / (1 + n2)\n\nLet x = sqrt(0.22) ≈ 0.4690:\n\nx = (1 - n2) / (1 + n2)\n\nNow, we can solve for n2:\n\nx * (1 + n2) = 1 - n2\n\nx + x * n2 = 1 - n2\n\nx + 2 * x * n2 = 1\n\nn2 = (1 - x) / (2 * x)\n\nn2 ≈ (1 - 0.4690) / (2 * 0.4690) ≈ 0.5655\n\nThus, the refractive index of the material is approximately 1.5655."
