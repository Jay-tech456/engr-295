    "message_1": "A supersonic aircraft is flying at Mach 2.5 and experiences a shock wave. If the ambient pressure is 101 kPa and the stagnation pressure is 256 kPa, what is the pressure behind the shock wave? Assume the flow is adiabatic and the specific heat ratio is 1.4.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the normal shock relations for an adiabatic flow. The normal shock relation for the pressure ratio across the shock wave is given by:\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1)) / (γ + 1)\n\nwhere P2 is the pressure behind the shock wave, P1 is the ambient pressure (101 kPa), γ is the specific heat ratio (1.4), and M1 is the Mach number (2.5).\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * 1.4 * 2.5^2 - (1.4 - 1)) / (1.4 + 1)\nP2/P1 = (7 * 6.25 - 0.4) / 2.4\nP2/P1 = (43.75 - 0.4) / 2.4\nP2/P1 = 43.35 / 2.4\nP2/P1 ≈ 18.0625\n\nNow, we can find the pressure behind the shock wave (P2) by multiplying the pressure ratio by the ambient pressure (P1):\n\nP2 = P1 * (P2/P1)\nP2 = 101 kPa * 18.0625\nP2 ≈ 1824.3125 kPa\n\nTherefore, the pressure behind the shock wave is approximately 1824.31 kPa."
