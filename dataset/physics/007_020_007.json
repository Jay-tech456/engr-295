    "message_2": "To determine the minimum thickness of lead required to reduce the intensity of gamma rays to one-tenth of its original value, we need to use the concept of half-value layer (HVL) and the attenuation equation.\n\nThe half-value layer is the thickness of a material required to reduce the intensity of radiation to half of its initial value. For lead, the HVL for 1.25 MeV gamma rays is approximately 0.4 cm (source: National Institute of Standards and Technology).\n\nThe attenuation equation is given by:\n\nI = I0 * e^(-μx)\n\nwhere I is the final intensity, I0 is the initial intensity, μ is the linear attenuation coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material.\n\nSince we want to reduce the intensity to one-tenth of its original value, we have:\n\n1/10 = e^(-μx)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/10) = -μx\n\nNow, we need to find the value of μ for lead and 1.25 MeV gamma rays. The mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ) for lead at this energy is approximately 0.033 cm^2/g (source: National Institute of Standards and Technology). The density of lead is 11.34 g/cm^3. Therefore, the linear attenuation coefficient μ is:\n\nμ = (μ/ρ) * ρ = 0.033 cm^2/g * 11.34 g/cm^3 = 0.374 cm^(-1)\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n\nln(1/10) = -0.374x\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = ln(1/10) / (-0.374) ≈ 6.17 cm\n\nSo, the minimum thickness of lead required to reduce the intensity of 1.25 MeV gamma rays to one-tenth of its original value is approximately 6.17 cm."
