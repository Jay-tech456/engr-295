    "message_1": "Consider a rectangular sheet with dimensions of 10 cm by 20 cm. The sheet carries a current of 2 A uniformly distributed over its surface. Find the magnetic field at a point P located 5 cm away from the center of the sheet and perpendicular to it.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the surface, we can define a current density J (A/m²) as:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere A is the area of the sheet. In this case, A = 10 cm × 20 cm = 0.1 m × 0.2 m = 0.02 m², and J = 2 A / 0.02 m² = 100 A/m².\n\nNow, we can divide the sheet into small rectangular strips parallel to the shorter side (10 cm) and consider the current in each strip. Let's take a strip of width dx at a distance x from the center of the sheet along the longer side (20 cm). The length of the strip is 10 cm (0.1 m), and its area is dA = 0.1 m * dx.\n\nThe current in the strip is given by:\n\ndI = J * dA = 100 A/m² * 0.1 m * dx\n\nNow, we can apply the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field dB due to this strip at point P:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl x r) / r³\n\nThe position vector r from the strip to point P has a magnitude of 5 cm (0.05 m) and is perpendicular to the sheet. The differential length vector dl is along the 10 cm side of the sheet and has a magnitude of 0.1 m. The angle between dl and r is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = |dl| * |r| * sin(90) = 0.1 m * 0.05 m = 0.005 m²\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (100 A/m² * 0.1 m * dx * 0.005 m²) / (0.05 m)³\n\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm² * 0.005 m² * dx) / 0.000125 m³\n\ndB = 0.04 T * dx\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire length of the sheet along the x-axis from -0.1 m to 0.1 m:\n\nB = ∫ dB = ∫ (0.04 T * dx) from -0.1 m to 0.1 m\n\nB = 0.04 T * (0.1 m - (-0.1 m))\n\nB = 0.04 T * 0.2 m\n\nB = 0.008 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is 0.008 T (Tesla)."
