    "message_2": "To calculate the average distance between galaxies in a cluster, we need the sum of all the distances between each pair of galaxies and the total number of pairs of galaxies. \n\nLet's denote the number of galaxies in the cluster as N. The total number of pairs of galaxies can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nTotal number of pairs = C(N, 2) = N! / (2! * (N-2)!)\n\nwhere N! is the factorial of N (N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1).\n\nNow, let's assume we have the individual distances between each pair of galaxies. We can denote these distances as d1, d2, d3, ..., dC(N, 2).\n\nTo find the average distance between galaxies, we need to sum up all these individual distances and divide by the total number of pairs:\n\nAverage distance = (d1 + d2 + d3 + ... + dC(N, 2)) / C(N, 2)\n\nIf you provide the individual distances and the number of galaxies, I can help you calculate the average distance between galaxies in the cluster."
