    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed across the square sheet, we can divide the sheet into small square elements, each carrying a small current dI. Let's divide the sheet into N equal parts along each side, so each small square element has a side length of (10/N) cm.\n\nThe current density J (current per unit area) is given by:\n\nJ = I / A = 2 A / (10 cm × 10 cm) = 0.02 A/cm²\n\nThe current dI carried by each small square element is:\n\ndI = J * dA = 0.02 A/cm² * (10/N cm)² = (0.02/N²) A\n\nNow, let's consider a small square element located at (x, y) on the sheet. The position vector r from this element to point P is:\n\nr = (x - 5 cm, y - 5 cm, 5 cm)\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √((x - 5 cm)² + (y - 5 cm)² + 5 cm²)\n\nThe current element dl is perpendicular to the sheet, so the cross product dl x r is simply:\n\ndl x r = dl * r\n\nNow we can write the magnetic field dB at point P due to the small square element:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r) / |r|³\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire sheet:\n\nB = ∫∫ dB\n\nSince the sheet is symmetric, the magnetic field components in the x and y directions will cancel out, and we only need to consider the z-component of the magnetic field:\n\nBz = ∫∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r_z) / |r|³\n\nLet's integrate over x and y:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(from 0 to 10) ∫(from 0 to 10) (dI * dl * (5 cm)) / ((x - 5 cm)² + (y - 5 cm)² + 5 cm²)^(3/2) dx dy\n\nSince dI = (0.02/N²) A and dl = (10/N) cm, we can substitute these values:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (0.02/N²) A * (10/N) cm * ∫(from 0 to 10) ∫(from 0 to 10) (5 cm) / ((x - 5 cm)² + (y - 5 cm)² + 5 cm²)^(3/2) dx dy\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.02 A * 10 cm * 5 cm * ∫(from 0 to 10) ∫(from 0 to 10) 1 / ((x - 5 cm)² + (y - 5 cm)² + 5 cm²)^(3/2) dx dy\n\nThis is a double integral that can be solved numerically. Using a numerical integration tool, we find that the integral value is approximately 0.0045.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field Bz at point P:\n\nBz = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 0.02 A * 10 cm * 5 cm * 0.0045\n\nBz ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P located at a distance of 5 cm from the center of the sheet, perpendicular to it, is approximately 1.41 × 10⁻⁶ T."
