    "message_1": "A current-carrying wire has a length of 2 meters and carries a current of 4 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 3 cm from the wire, assuming the current flows vertically upward?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance r from a long straight current-carrying wire, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nI = 4 A (current)\nr = 3 cm = 0.03 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.06 m)\nB = (8 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.03 m)\nB ≈ 2.67 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field is approximately 2.67 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nTo find the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. Since the current flows vertically upward, point your right thumb in the direction of the current (upward) and curl your fingers. Your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be circulating around the wire in a clockwise direction when viewed from above.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field is approximately 2.67 × 10^(-5) T, and the direction is clockwise when viewed from above."
