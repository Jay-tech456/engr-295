    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and second dark fringes, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula for dark fringes:\n\nsin(θ) = (m + 1/2) * (λ / a)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the dark fringe, m is the order of the dark fringe (0 for the first dark fringe, 1 for the second, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFor the first dark fringe (m = 0):\n\nsin(θ1) = (1/2) * (λ / a)\n\nFor the second dark fringe (m = 1):\n\nsin(θ2) = (3/2) * (λ / a)\n\nNow, we can use the small-angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ (in radians)\n\nSo, the angles for the first and second dark fringes are:\n\nθ1 ≈ (1/2) * (λ / a)\nθ2 ≈ (3/2) * (λ / a)\n\nThe distance (y) between the central maximum and the dark fringe on the screen can be found using the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere L is the distance between the slit and the screen. Using the small-angle approximation, we get:\n\ny = L * θ\n\nFor the first dark fringe:\n\ny1 = L * θ1 = L * (1/2) * (λ / a)\n\nFor the second dark fringe:\n\ny2 = L * θ2 = L * (3/2) * (λ / a)\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the first and second dark fringes:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = L * (3/2) * (λ / a) - L * (1/2) * (λ / a) = L * (λ / a)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\nL = 2 m\n\nΔy = 2 * (650 * 10^(-9) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)))\n\nΔy ≈ 0.0065 m = 6.5 mm\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second dark fringes on the screen is approximately 6.5 mm."
