    "message_2": "The current understanding of the universe suggests that there is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of almost every galaxy, including our own Milky Way. Therefore, the expected ratio of supermassive black holes to normal galaxies is approximately 1:1.\n\nThis ratio is believed to have evolved over time due to the processes of galaxy formation and mergers. In the early universe, smaller galaxies and black holes formed first. As these smaller galaxies merged, their central black holes also merged, forming more massive black holes. This process continued over billions of years, leading to the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.\n\nThe ratio of SMBHs to galaxies may change slightly over time due to galaxy mergers and interactions. When two galaxies merge, their central black holes will eventually merge as well, resulting in a single galaxy with a more massive SMBH at its center. This would temporarily decrease the number of galaxies relative to the number of SMBHs. However, as new galaxies continue to form, the ratio should remain close to 1:1 on a large scale.\n\nIt is important to note that our understanding of the universe and the processes that govern it is constantly evolving. As new data and observations become available, our understanding of the relationship between supermassive black holes and galaxies may change."
