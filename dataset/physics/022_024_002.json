    "message_2": "The likelihood that dark matter is made up of dark scalars or dark fermions is still an open question in the field of physics. There are several theoretical models and observational evidence that suggest the existence of dark matter, but the exact nature and composition of dark matter particles remain unknown.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThere are several candidates for dark matter particles, including dark scalars and dark fermions. Dark scalars are hypothetical scalar particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter, while dark fermions are hypothetical fermionic particles that also interact weakly with ordinary matter.\n\nDark scalars, such as axions and axion-like particles, are considered as possible dark matter candidates because they can be produced in the early universe and have the right properties to account for the observed dark matter abundance. Some theoretical models predict the existence of dark scalars, and there are ongoing experiments searching for these particles.\n\nDark fermions, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and sterile neutrinos, are also considered as possible dark matter candidates. WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact through the weak nuclear force and gravity, making them difficult to detect. Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical neutrinos that do not interact through the weak nuclear force, making them even more elusive. Both WIMPs and sterile neutrinos have been proposed as dark matter candidates in various theoretical models, and there are ongoing experiments searching for these particles as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the likelihood that dark matter is made up of dark scalars or dark fermions is still uncertain, as there is no direct detection or conclusive evidence for either type of particle. However, both dark scalars and dark fermions remain viable candidates for dark matter, and ongoing experiments and theoretical developments may provide more insights into the nature of dark matter in the future."
