    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle of attack for a NACA airfoil with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 12% and a Reynolds number of 1.5 million, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Determine the airfoil's lift coefficient (Cl) at the point of transition from laminar to turbulent flow.\n2. Calculate the critical angle of attack (α) using the lift coefficient.\n\nStep 1: Determine the lift coefficient (Cl) at the point of transition\nFor a NACA airfoil with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 12%, the lift coefficient at the point of transition can be approximated using the empirical relation:\n\nCl_max ≈ 1.5\n\nThis approximation is based on experimental data for NACA airfoils and is valid for Reynolds numbers in the range of 1 to 10 million.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the critical angle of attack (α) using the lift coefficient\nThe lift coefficient (Cl) is related to the angle of attack (α) by the following equation:\n\nCl = 2π * sin(α)\n\nSolving for the angle of attack, we get:\n\nα = arcsin(Cl / (2π))\n\nPlugging in the value of Cl_max (1.5) from Step 1:\n\nα = arcsin(1.5 / (2π))\n\nα ≈ 0.24 radians\n\nConverting radians to degrees:\n\nα ≈ 0.24 * (180/π) ≈ 13.8 degrees\n\nTherefore, the critical angle of attack for the given NACA airfoil with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 12% and a Reynolds number of 1.5 million is approximately 13.8 degrees. At this angle of attack, the laminar flow over the airfoil transitions to turbulent flow and experiences flow separation, resulting in a stall."
