    "message_2": "The curvature of spacetime affects the trajectory of a photon passing near a massive object, such as a black hole, by causing the photon's path to bend. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing and is a direct consequence of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nTo determine the observed deflection angle, we can use the formula derived from General Relativity:\n\nΔθ = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere Δθ is the deflection angle, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the massive object (e.g., a black hole), c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the closest distance between the photon's path and the massive object).\n\nNow, let's compare this with the prediction of Newtonian gravity. In Newtonian gravity, the deflection angle is given by:\n\nΔθ_N = (2 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nAs we can see, the deflection angle predicted by General Relativity is twice the value predicted by Newtonian gravity. This difference is significant and has been confirmed through various observations, such as the famous 1919 solar eclipse experiment conducted by Sir Arthur Eddington, which provided strong evidence for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity."
