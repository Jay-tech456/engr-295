    "message_2": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It is designed to reach a maximum collision energy of 14 tera-electronvolts (TeV) or 14 trillion electron volts. This energy level is achieved by accelerating two beams of particles in opposite directions around the 27-kilometer ring of the LHC.\n\nThe particles used in the LHC are mainly protons, which are the positively charged constituents of atomic nuclei. Protons are chosen because they are relatively easy to accelerate and their collisions can produce a wide range of interesting phenomena and new particles. Additionally, the LHC can also accelerate and collide heavy ions, such as lead nuclei, to study the properties of matter under extreme conditions. The maximum energy for heavy ion collisions is lower than that for proton-proton collisions, reaching around 1,150 TeV for lead-lead collisions."
