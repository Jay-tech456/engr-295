    "message_1": "Imagine a spaceship traveling towards Earth at a speed of 0.6c. A radio signal is sent from the spaceship with a frequency of 500 MHz. A laboratory on Earth detects the signal with a frequency of 600 MHz. What is the speed of the signal relative to the spaceship?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula for frequency:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency detected on Earth (600 MHz), f_emitted is the frequency emitted by the spaceship (500 MHz), v is the relative velocity between the Earth and the spaceship (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's solve for the ratio of the frequencies:\n\nf_observed / f_emitted = sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\n600 MHz / 500 MHz = sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\n\n1.2 = sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\n\nNow, square both sides of the equation:\n\n1.2^2 = (1.6 / 0.4)\n\n1.44 = 4\n\nNow, let's solve for the speed of the signal relative to the spaceship:\n\nv_signal = c * (1 - 1/1.44)\n\nv_signal = c * (1 - 0.6944)\n\nv_signal = c * 0.3056\n\nv_signal â‰ˆ 0.3056c\n\nSo, the speed of the signal relative to the spaceship is approximately 0.3056 times the speed of light."
