    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law. For a circular coil, the magnetic field at the center is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns in the coil, I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nN = 150 turns\nI = 5 A\nR = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 150 * 5) / (2 * 0.1)\nB = (6π × 10^(-6) Tm * 150 * 5) / 0.2\nB = (3π × 10^(-5) Tm * 150 * 5)\nB = 15π × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately:\n\nB ≈ 15π × 10^(-5) T"
