    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter in galaxies:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass distribution. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, unseen dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, which provides the additional gravitational force needed to keep the outer stars and gas in their orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: According to General Relativity, massive objects can bend the path of light due to their gravitational influence. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, has been observed around galaxy clusters, where the amount of lensing is much stronger than can be accounted for by the visible mass alone. This suggests the presence of a large amount of unseen mass, attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the early universe. Observations of the CMB's temperature fluctuations provide information about the density and composition of the universe. The data is consistent with a universe composed of approximately 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be explained by the presence of dark matter. Dark matter provides the gravitational \"scaffolding\" upon which visible matter accumulates and forms galaxies and galaxy clusters. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter are consistent with the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nGeneral Relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, plays a crucial role in understanding the presence and behavior of dark matter in the universe. General Relativity describes how mass and energy warp spacetime, causing objects to move along curved paths. This framework allows us to model the gravitational effects of dark matter on visible matter and radiation, even though dark matter itself does not interact with light.\n\nIn the context of General Relativity, dark matter is often modeled as a pressureless, non-relativistic fluid called \"cold dark matter\" (CDM). This model has been successful in explaining the observed large-scale structure of the universe, the CMB radiation, and the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, the exact nature and composition of dark matter remain unknown, and its detection and characterization are active areas of research in modern physics."
