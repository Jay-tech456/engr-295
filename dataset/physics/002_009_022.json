    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to melt 200g of ice at 0℃ and convert it to liquid water at 0℃, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × latent heat of fusion (L)\n\nGiven the mass (m) = 200g and the latent heat of fusion (L) = 334 J/g, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = 200g × 334 J/g\n\nQ = 66800 J\n\nSo, the amount of energy required to melt 200g of ice at 0℃ and convert it to liquid water at 0℃ is 66,800 Joules."
