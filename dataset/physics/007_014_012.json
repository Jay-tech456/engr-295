    "message_2": "Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon, which means it has the same number of protons as other carbon isotopes but a different number of neutrons. The number 14 in \"carbon-14\" refers to its atomic mass, which is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nCarbon has an atomic number of 6, which means it has 6 protons. To find the number of neutrons in carbon-14, we can subtract the number of protons from the atomic mass:\n\nNumber of neutrons = Atomic mass - Number of protons\nNumber of neutrons = 14 - 6\nNumber of neutrons = 8\n\nSo, a nucleus of carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.\n\nThe ratio of protons to neutrons affects the stability of the nucleus. In general, lighter elements (with lower atomic numbers) are more stable when the number of protons and neutrons is roughly equal. As elements get heavier, they tend to be more stable with a slightly higher number of neutrons than protons.\n\nCarbon-14 has a higher neutron-to-proton ratio (8:6 or 4:3) than the most stable isotope of carbon, carbon-12 (6 neutrons and 6 protons, with a 1:1 ratio). This higher ratio makes carbon-14 less stable, and it is radioactive. Carbon-14 undergoes beta decay, in which a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an electron antineutrino. This decay process reduces the neutron-to-proton ratio, transforming carbon-14 into a more stable isotope, nitrogen-14 (with 7 protons and 7 neutrons)."
