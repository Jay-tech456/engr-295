    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop along the axis.\n\nGiven values:\nI = 2 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7)) / (2 * 0.0559016994)\n\nB ≈ 1.78 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the loop that is 10 cm away from the center of the loop is approximately 1.78 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
