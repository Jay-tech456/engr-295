    "message_2": "According to General Relativity, a massive object curves the spacetime fabric due to its mass and energy. This curvature of spacetime is responsible for the force we perceive as gravity. The more massive an object is, the more it curves the spacetime around it.\n\nIn General Relativity, gravity is not considered a force like in classical physics (Newtonian gravity). Instead, it is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Objects moving in this curved spacetime follow paths called geodesics, which are the shortest paths between two points in a curved space. These paths appear as if they are influenced by a gravitational force, but they are actually just following the natural curvature of spacetime.\n\nThe mathematical description of this curvature is given by the Einstein field equations, which relate the distribution of mass and energy in spacetime to the curvature of spacetime. The equations are a set of ten interrelated differential equations that are quite complex and difficult to solve. However, they provide a precise description of how mass and energy curve spacetime and how objects move in this curved spacetime.\n\nIn simple terms, the presence of a massive object causes spacetime to curve around it, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects nearby. The more massive the object, the greater the curvature of spacetime, and the stronger the apparent gravitational force. This is the fundamental idea behind General Relativity's description of gravity and the curvature of spacetime."
