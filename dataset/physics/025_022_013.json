    "message_2": "To calculate the force required to pull apart the duplicated chromosomes during the anaphase stage of mitosis, we need to consider the forces acting on the chromosomes. The main force acting on the chromosomes during anaphase is the force exerted by the mitotic spindle, which is composed of microtubules. These microtubules attach to the kinetochores of the sister chromatids and exert a pulling force to separate them.\n\nThe force exerted by the mitotic spindle can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nF = k * x\n\nwhere F is the force, k is the stiffness constant of the microtubules, and x is the displacement of the chromosomes (i.e., the distance they need to be pulled apart).\n\nThe stiffness constant (k) of microtubules has been experimentally determined to be around 1 pN/nm (piconewtons per nanometer) (Koshland, D. E., Mitchison, T. J., & Kirschner, M. W. (1988). Polewards chromosome movement driven by microtubule depolymerization in vitro. Nature, 331(6155), 499-504).\n\nThe displacement (x) can be calculated by converting the given distance between the replicated chromosomes (1 micrometer) to nanometers:\n\nx = 1 micrometer * 1000 nm/micrometer = 1000 nm\n\nNow we can calculate the force (F):\n\nF = k * x\nF = 1 pN/nm * 1000 nm\nF = 1000 pN\n\nTherefore, the force required to pull apart the duplicated chromosomes during the anaphase stage of mitosis in a mammalian cell is approximately 1000 piconewtons."
