    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point due to a straight conductor, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since we are dealing with a straight conductor, we can use Ampere's Law, which is a simplified version of the Biot-Savart Law for this specific case.\n\nAmpere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a straight conductor is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n- I is the current flowing through the conductor, which is 10 A in this case\n- r is the distance from the conductor to the point, which is 5 cm or 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 40π × 10^(-6) T\n\nB ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 5 cm away from the conductor is approximately 1.26 × 10^(-4) Tesla.\n\nAs for the direction of the magnetic field, it can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the conductor), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. In this case, since we don't have any information about the orientation of the conductor, we can only say that the magnetic field lines will form concentric circles around the conductor, with the conductor at the center."
