    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * G * M) / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 3 times the mass of the sun, we first need to convert the solar mass (M_sun) into kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\nM = 3 * M_sun = 3 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 5.967 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 × 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ 8.846 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass equal to 3 times the mass of the sun is approximately 8,846 meters or 8.846 kilometers."
