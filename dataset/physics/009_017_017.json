    "message_1": "A student is conducting an experiment to observe the single-slit diffraction pattern produced by a laser of wavelength 650 nm. The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m, and the width of the slit is 0.1 mm. What will be the distance between the first and the second minima on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and second minima on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minima, m is the order of the minima (1 for the first minimum, 2 for the second minimum, and so on), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\nθ1 = (1 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 6.5 * 10^(-6) rad\nθ2 = (2 * 650 * 10^(-9)) / (0.1 * 10^(-3)) = 13 * 10^(-6) rad\n\nNext, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance between the first and second minima on the screen:\n\nΔy = L * (θ2 - θ1)\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between the first and second minima, and L is the distance between the slit and the screen.\n\nΔy = 1.5 * (13 * 10^(-6) - 6.5 * 10^(-6))\nΔy = 1.5 * 6.5 * 10^(-6)\nΔy = 9.75 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second minima on the screen is approximately 9.75 * 10^(-6) m, or 9.75 μm."
