    "message_2": "The topology of the electronic structure plays a crucial role in determining the conductivity of materials in topological insulators and semimetals. Topological insulators are materials that are insulating in their bulk but have conducting surface states. These unique properties arise from the topological nature of their electronic structure.\n\nIn topological insulators, the electronic structure is characterized by a non-trivial topological invariant, which is a mathematical quantity that remains unchanged under continuous deformations of the system. This topological invariant is responsible for the existence of gapless surface states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry. These surface states form a Dirac cone-like dispersion relation, where the conduction and valence bands touch at a single point (the Dirac point).\n\nThe conductivity of topological insulators is determined by the presence of these surface states. Since the surface states are protected by time-reversal symmetry, they are robust against non-magnetic impurities and defects, which means that the conductivity remains high even in the presence of disorder. Moreover, the spin-momentum locking of the surface states leads to unique spin-dependent transport properties, such as the spin Hall effect and the spin Seebeck effect.\n\nIn topological semimetals, the electronic structure is characterized by the presence of band crossings, which can be either point-like (nodal points) or line-like (nodal lines). These band crossings are also protected by certain topological invariants and symmetries. Depending on the type of band crossing and the symmetry protection, topological semimetals can be classified into different types, such as Weyl semimetals, Dirac semimetals, and nodal-line semimetals.\n\nThe conductivity of topological semimetals is determined by the presence of these band crossings and the associated Fermi arc surface states. The Fermi arc surface states are unique to topological semimetals and connect the projections of the bulk band crossings on the surface Brillouin zone. These surface states can give rise to novel transport properties, such as the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect.\n\nIn summary, the topology of the electronic structure plays a crucial role in determining the conductivity of materials in topological insulators and semimetals. The topological invariants and symmetries protect the gapless surface states and band crossings, which give rise to unique transport properties that are robust against disorder and defects."
