And how much water will overflow if this cube is now placed in a container completely filled with water? (density of water=1000 kg/m³, g=9.81 m/s²)",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the weight of the cube.\n\nThe volume of the cube can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cube:\n\nVolume = side_length³\nVolume = (0.1 m)³ = 0.001 m³ (converted from cm to m)\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the cube using the formula:\n\nMass = Density × Volume\nMass = 800 kg/m³ × 0.001 m³ = 0.8 kg\n\nNext, we can find the weight of the cube using the formula:\n\nWeight = Mass × g\nWeight = 0.8 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 7.848 N\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the cube that is submerged in water.\n\nWhen the cube is floating, the buoyant force acting on it is equal to its weight. The buoyant force can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBuoyant force = Density of water × Volume submerged × g\n\nSince the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the cube:\n\n7.848 N = 1000 kg/m³ × Volume submerged × 9.81 m/s²\n\nWe can now solve for the volume submerged:\n\nVolume submerged = 7.848 N / (1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s²) = 0.0008 m³\n\nFinally, let's find out how much water will overflow when the cube is placed in a container completely filled with water.\n\nSince the volume of the cube is 0.001 m³ and the volume submerged is 0.0008 m³, the volume of the cube above the water is:\n\nVolume above water = Total volume - Volume submerged\nVolume above water = 0.001 m³ - 0.0008 m³ = 0.0002 m³\n\nWhen the cube is placed in the container, the volume above the water will cause an equal volume of water to overflow:\n\nVolume of water overflow = 0.0002 m³\n\nSo, the weight of the cube is 7.848 N, the volume of the cube submerged in water is 0.0008 m³, and the volume of water that will overflow when the cube is placed in a completely filled container is 0.0002 m³."
