    "message_2": "The Kerr metric describes a rotating black hole, and its rotation rate (angular velocity) can be determined by its mass (M) and angular momentum (J). The angular momentum is related to the black hole's spin parameter (a), which is defined as a = J/Mc, where c is the speed of light.\n\nFor a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass to the SI unit of kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nTo find the angular velocity, we need to know the spin parameter (a) of the black hole. The spin parameter can range from 0 (non-rotating) to 1 (maximally rotating). Without knowing the exact value of the spin parameter, we cannot determine the precise angular velocity of the black hole.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general formula for the angular velocity (ω) in terms of the spin parameter (a), mass (M), and gravitational constant (G):\n\nω = (a * c^2) / (2 * G * M + 2 * (G * M)^0.5 * (G * M * a^2 + c^2)^0.5)\n\nIn this formula, G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, and c is the speed of light, approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nTo find the angular velocity of the black hole for a specific spin parameter, simply plug in the values for a, M, G, and c into the formula above."
