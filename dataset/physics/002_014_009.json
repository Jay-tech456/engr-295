    "message_1": "A refrigerator operates between temperatures of 5 °C and -15 °C. If the refrigerator requires 175 J of work input to remove 525 J of heat from the cold reservoir, what is the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator? What is the efficiency of the refrigerator?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) to the work input (W) required to remove that heat. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nGiven that the refrigerator requires 175 J of work input (W) to remove 525 J of heat (Q_c) from the cold reservoir, we can calculate the COP as follows:\n\nCOP = 525 J / 175 J = 3\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is 3.\n\nThe efficiency of a refrigerator is not the same as its COP. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of the useful output to the total input. In the case of a refrigerator, the useful output is the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c), and the total input is the sum of the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) and the work input (W). Mathematically, the efficiency (η) can be expressed as:\n\nη = Q_c / (Q_c + W)\n\nUsing the given values of Q_c and W, we can calculate the efficiency as follows:\n\nη = 525 J / (525 J + 175 J) = 525 J / 700 J = 0.75\n\nThe efficiency of the refrigerator is 0.75 or 75%."
