    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = h/(m_e * c) * (1 - cosθ)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ' is the final wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven the initial wavelength λ = 500 nm = 5 x 10^-7 m and the scattering angle θ = 90 degrees, we can find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(90°))\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.738 x 10^-22 kg m/s) * (1 - 0)\nΔλ ≈ 2.42 x 10^-12 m\n\nNow, we can find the final wavelength λ':\n\nλ' = λ + Δλ\nλ' = 5 x 10^-7 m + 2.42 x 10^-12 m\nλ' ≈ 5.00000242 x 10^-7 m\n\nTo find the change in frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nΔf = f' - f = c * (1/λ - 1/λ')\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f' is the final frequency, and f is the initial frequency.\n\nFirst, we find the initial frequency f:\n\nf = c / λ\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5 x 10^-7 m)\nf ≈ 6 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNext, we find the final frequency f':\n\nf' = c / λ'\nf' = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5.00000242 x 10^-7 m)\nf' ≈ 5.99999758 x 10^14 Hz\n\nFinally, we find the change in frequency Δf:\n\nΔf = f' - f\nΔf = 5.99999758 x 10^14 Hz - 6 x 10^14 Hz\nΔf ≈ -2.42 x 10^9 Hz\n\nSo, the change in wavelength is approximately 2.42 x 10^-12 m, and the change in frequency is approximately -2.42 x 10^9 Hz."
