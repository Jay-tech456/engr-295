An object which is 10 cm tall is placed 30 cm in front of the lens. \n\na) Where is the image formed, and what is its height?\nb) Is the image real or virtual?\nc) Is the image upright or inverted?\n\nSolve for the above values.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nLens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u = h'/h\n\nGiven:\nFocal length (f) = 20 cm\nObject distance (u) = -30 cm (negative sign indicates the object is on the left side of the lens)\nObject height (h) = 10 cm\n\na) We need to find the image distance (v) and image height (h').\n\nUsing the lens formula:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/30\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 60\n1/v = 5/60\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\nM = -v/u = h'/h\nM = -12 / (-30)\nM = 2/5\n\nNow, we can find the image height (h'):\nh' = M * h\nh' = (2/5) * 10\nh' = 4 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed 12 cm to the right of the lens, and its height is 4 cm.\n\nb) Since the image distance (v) is positive, the image is real.\n\nc) The magnification (M) is positive, which means the image is upright.\n\nIn summary:\na) The image is formed 12 cm to the right of the lens, and its height is 4 cm.\nb) The image is real.\nc) The image is upright."
