    "message_1": "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, for the reaction of the combustion of methane (CH4) at 298 K, given the standard enthalpy of combustion of methane, ΔH°comb = -890.4 kJ/mol, and the standard entropy change, ΔS°, of the reaction = -242.8 J/K. Is the reaction spontaneous at standard conditions?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nGiven values:\nΔH°comb = -890.4 kJ/mol\nΔS° = -242.8 J/K\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert ΔS° to kJ/K:\n\nΔS° = -242.8 J/K * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.2428 kJ/K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-890.4 kJ/mol) - (298 K * -0.2428 kJ/K)\nΔG = -890.4 kJ/mol + 72.4 kJ/mol\nΔG = -818 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of methane at 298 K is -818 kJ/mol.\n\nSince ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous at standard conditions."
