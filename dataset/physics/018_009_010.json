    "message_2": "To find the temperature of a black hole, we can use the formula for the Hawking temperature, which is given by:\n\nT = (ħc^3) / (8πGMk_B)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a black hole with a mass equivalent to the Sun, we have:\n\nM = M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nThe values of the constants are:\n\nħ = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js\nc = 2.998 x 10^8 m/s\nG = 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2\nk_B = 1.381 x 10^-23 J/K\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nT = (1.054 x 10^-34 Js * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^3) / (8π * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) * (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K))\n\nT ≈ 6.17 x 10^-8 K\n\nSo, the maximum temperature of a black hole with a mass equivalent to the Sun is approximately 6.17 x 10^-8 K.\n\nAs the black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation, its temperature will increase. This is because the temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, as seen in the formula. As the mass decreases, the temperature will increase. However, the rate at which the black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation is extremely slow, especially for a black hole with a mass equivalent to the Sun. It would take an incredibly long time, much longer than the current age of the universe, for the black hole to lose a significant amount of mass and for its temperature to increase noticeably."
