    "message_2": "The presence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a distant galaxy can have an observable effect on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation through a phenomenon called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. The SZ effect occurs when CMB photons interact with the hot electrons in the vicinity of the SMBH, causing a distortion in the CMB spectrum.\n\nThe SZ effect can be divided into two main components: the thermal SZ effect and the kinetic SZ effect. The thermal SZ effect is caused by the inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons by the hot electrons in the intracluster medium (ICM) surrounding the SMBH. This effect causes a distortion in the CMB spectrum, which can be observed as a decrement in the CMB temperature at frequencies below 217 GHz and an increment at higher frequencies.\n\nThe kinetic SZ effect is caused by the peculiar motion of the galaxy cluster hosting the SMBH relative to the CMB rest frame. This effect induces a Doppler shift in the CMB spectrum, which can be observed as a temperature shift in the CMB radiation.\n\nThe expected observable signal in the CMB due to the presence of a SMBH depends on several factors, such as the mass of the black hole, the temperature and density of the ICM, and the distance of the SMBH from Earth.\n\n1. Black hole mass: The mass of the SMBH affects the temperature and density of the ICM. More massive black holes can heat the ICM to higher temperatures, leading to a stronger thermal SZ effect. However, the relationship between the SMBH mass and the SZ effect is not straightforward, as other factors like the cooling mechanisms and the feedback processes in the galaxy cluster can also influence the ICM properties.\n\n2. Distance from Earth: The observed amplitude of the SZ effect depends on the angular diameter distance to the galaxy cluster hosting the SMBH. As the distance from Earth increases, the angular diameter distance also increases, causing a decrease in the observed amplitude of the SZ effect. However, the SZ effect is redshift-independent, meaning that the shape of the distortion in the CMB spectrum remains the same regardless of the distance.\n\nIn summary, the expected observable signal in the CMB due to the presence of a SMBH in a distant galaxy depends on the mass of the black hole and its distance from Earth, as well as the properties of the ICM surrounding the SMBH. Observations of the SZ effect can provide valuable information about the properties of SMBHs and the galaxy clusters they reside in, helping to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of these massive objects."
