    "message_1": "What is the maximum energy of an ejected photoelectron from a copper surface illuminated with violet light of wavelength 400 nm, given that the work function of copper is 4.7 eV?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum energy of an ejected photoelectron, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE_max = hf - Φ\n\nwhere E_max is the maximum energy of the ejected photoelectron, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the light, and Φ is the work function of the material.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the violet light. We can do this using the speed of light (c) and the given wavelength (λ):\n\nc = λf\n\nRearranging for f:\n\nf = c / λ\n\nThe speed of light (c) is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s, and the given wavelength (λ) is 400 nm, which is equivalent to 400 x 10^-9 m. Plugging in these values:\n\nf = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (400 x 10^-9 m)\n\nf = 7.5 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow we can plug the frequency (f) and the work function (Φ) into the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE_max = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (7.5 x 10^14 Hz) - (4.7 eV)\n\nE_max = 4.97 x 10^-19 J - (4.7 eV)\n\nTo subtract the work function, we need to convert it to joules. We know that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so:\n\nΦ = 4.7 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 7.53 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can subtract the work function:\n\nE_max = 4.97 x 10^-19 J - 7.53 x 10^-19 J\n\nE_max = -2.56 x 10^-19 J\n\nSince the maximum energy of an ejected photoelectron cannot be negative, this means that the violet light with a wavelength of 400 nm does not have enough energy to eject a photoelectron from the copper surface. The work function of copper (4.7 eV) is higher than the energy provided by the violet light."
