    "message_2": "To determine the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator (60) and rewrite the equation:\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/v\n\nSubtracting 2/60 from both sides, we get:\n\n1/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed 60 cm away from the mirror along the principal axis.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification is -2, which means the image is inverted (since the magnification is negative) and twice the size of the object (since the absolute value of the magnification is 2).\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is 60 cm away from the mirror along the principal axis, inverted, and twice the size of the object."
