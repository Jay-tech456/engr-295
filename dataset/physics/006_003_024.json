    "message_2": "To calculate the splitting of the spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field, we can use the Zeeman effect equation:\n\nΔE = μ * B * m\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the split levels, μ is the magnetic moment of the hydrogen atom, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values -1, 0, and 1 for the Balmer-β line.\n\nGiven the magnetic moment μ = 9.27 × 10^-24 J/T and the magnetic field strength B = 0.1 T, we can calculate the energy difference for each value of m:\n\nΔE = (9.27 × 10^-24 J/T) * (0.1 T) * m\n\nFor m = -1:\nΔE = (9.27 × 10^-24 J/T) * (0.1 T) * (-1) = -9.27 × 10^-25 J\n\nFor m = 0:\nΔE = 0 J (no energy difference)\n\nFor m = 1:\nΔE = (9.27 × 10^-24 J/T) * (0.1 T) * (1) = 9.27 × 10^-25 J\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding wavelength shifts using the energy-wavelength relationship:\n\nΔE = h * c * (1/λ - 1/λ')\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), λ is the original wavelength (486.1 nm), and λ' is the shifted wavelength.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ':\n\nλ' = 1 / ((1/λ) - (ΔE / (h * c)))\n\nFor m = -1:\nλ' = 1 / ((1/(486.1 × 10^-9 m)) - ((-9.27 × 10^-25 J) / (6.626 × 10^-34 Js * 3 × 10^8 m/s))) ≈ 486.099 nm\n\nFor m = 0:\nλ' = λ = 486.1 nm (no wavelength shift)\n\nFor m = 1:\nλ' = 1 / ((1/(486.1 × 10^-9 m)) - ((9.27 × 10^-25 J) / (6.626 × 10^-34 Js * 3 × 10^8 m/s))) ≈ 486.101 nm\n\nSo, the splitting of the spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field of strength 0.1 T for the hydrogen atom's Balmer-β line (λ=486.1 nm) results in wavelengths of approximately 486.099 nm, 486.1 nm, and 486.101 nm."
