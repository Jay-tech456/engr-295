    "message_2": "To estimate the expected rate of gravitational wave detections from binary white dwarfs (BWDs) within a distance of 100 Mpc and a total mass range of 1.2-1.4 solar masses, we need to consider the sensitivity of current gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo and the merger rate of BWDs.\n\n1. Merger rate of BWDs: Observations of Galactic binary white dwarfs suggest a merger rate of about 1 per 1000 years per Milky Way-sized galaxy (Maoz et al. 2018). \n\n2. Number of galaxies within 100 Mpc: The average number density of galaxies is about 0.01 Mpc^(-3) (Conselice et al. 2016). Within a sphere of radius 100 Mpc, there are approximately 4.19 million Mpc^3 (volume of a sphere = 4/3 * pi * r^3). Therefore, there are about 41,900 galaxies within 100 Mpc.\n\n3. Total merger rate within 100 Mpc: Considering the merger rate of 1 per 1000 years per galaxy, the total merger rate within 100 Mpc is about 41,900/1000 = 41.9 mergers per year.\n\n4. Sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo: The sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo to BWDs is limited, as their frequency range is optimized for higher-mass compact binaries like binary neutron stars and black holes. BWDs emit gravitational waves at lower frequencies, which are less detectable by LIGO and Virgo. The expected detection rate of BWDs by LIGO and Virgo is currently very low (Korol et al. 2017).\n\nConsidering the limited sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo to BWDs, the expected rate of gravitational wave detections from BWDs within a distance of 100 Mpc and a total mass range of 1.2-1.4 solar masses is likely to be very low, possibly less than one detection per year. Future detectors like LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) will be more sensitive to the frequency range of BWDs and are expected to significantly increase the detection rate of BWD mergers."
