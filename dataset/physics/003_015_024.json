    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is symmetric, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the square and then multiply the result by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square. We can divide the side into small segments (dl) and integrate the magnetic field contribution from each segment. The angle between dl and r will be the same for all segments, so we can take it out of the integral. The magnitude of the cross product dl x r will be equal to dl * r * sin(θ), where θ is the angle between dl and r.\n\nFor a square loop, the angle θ is 45 degrees or π/4 radians. Therefore, sin(θ) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the magnetic field due to one side of the square:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r * sin(θ)) / r³\n\nIntegrating over the length of the side (from 0 to L):\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r * sin(θ)) / r³ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) * ∫(dl) / r²\n\nThe distance r from the center to any point on the side is constant and equal to (L/2) / cos(θ), where L is the side length of the square. So, r² = (L²/4) / cos²(θ).\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * sin(θ)) * (L/2) / ((L²/4) / cos²(θ))\n\nSince there are 4 sides, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nI = 5 A\nL = 0.2 m\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\nsin(θ) = 1/√2\ncos²(θ) = 1/2\n\nB_total = 4 * ((4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 4π) * (5 A * (1/√2) * (0.2 m / 2)) / ((0.2 m² / 4) / (1/2))\nB_total = 10^(-6) * (5 * 0.1) / (0.02 / 2)\nB_total = 5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is 5 × 10^(-5) T or 50 μT."
