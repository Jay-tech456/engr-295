    "message_2": "In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the relationship between the external magnetic field strength (B0) and the resonance frequency (ν) is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nν = γ * B0 / (2 * π)\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is a constant specific to a particular nucleus. The gyromagnetic ratio is the proportionality constant that relates the magnetic moment of a nucleus to its angular momentum. Different nuclei have different gyromagnetic ratios, which leads to different resonance frequencies for the same external magnetic field strength.\n\nThe relationship between the external magnetic field strength and the resonance frequency varies for different nuclei due to the differences in their gyromagnetic ratios. For example, let's compare two common nuclei used in NMR spectroscopy: ¹H (proton) and ¹³C (carbon-13).\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratios for ¹H and ¹³C are:\n\nγ(¹H) = 267.513 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1\nγ(¹³C) = 67.262 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1\n\nLet's calculate the resonance frequencies for both nuclei in a magnetic field strength of 11.7 T (Tesla), which is a common field strength for NMR spectrometers.\n\nFor ¹H:\n\nν(¹H) = (267.513 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1) * (11.7 T) / (2 * π)\nν(¹H) ≈ 499.839 * 10^6 Hz\n\nFor ¹³C:\n\nν(¹³C) = (67.262 * 10^6 rad T^-1 s^-1) * (11.7 T) / (2 * π)\nν(¹³C) ≈ 125.692 * 10^6 Hz\n\nAs we can see, the resonance frequencies for ¹H and ¹³C are different due to their different gyromagnetic ratios. In general, the relationship between the external magnetic field strength and the resonance frequency will vary for different nuclei because of the differences in their gyromagnetic ratios."
