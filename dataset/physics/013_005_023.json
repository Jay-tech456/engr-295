    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is a key piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The CMB provides evidence for the Big Bang theory in several ways:\n\n1. Uniformity: The CMB radiation is remarkably uniform across the sky, with only tiny fluctuations in temperature (about 1 part in 100,000). This uniformity supports the idea that the early universe was in a state of thermal equilibrium, which is consistent with the Big Bang model.\n\n2. Blackbody spectrum: The CMB radiation has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum, which means that its intensity at different frequencies follows a specific pattern that is characteristic of thermal radiation. This is exactly what would be expected if the CMB originated from the hot, dense early universe, as predicted by the Big Bang theory.\n\n3. Temperature: The current temperature of the CMB is about 2.7 Kelvin, which is very close to the predicted temperature based on the expansion and cooling of the universe since the Big Bang. This agreement between observation and prediction further supports the Big Bang model.\n\n4. Fluctuations: The tiny fluctuations in the CMB temperature provide important information about the early moments of the universe. These fluctuations are thought to be the result of small density variations in the early universe, which later grew into the large-scale structures (galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc.) that we see today. The pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang theory and the theory of cosmic inflation, which suggests that the universe underwent a brief period of rapid expansion shortly after the Big Bang.\n\nIn summary, the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation provides strong evidence for the Big Bang theory by showing that the early universe was hot, dense, and in thermal equilibrium, and by providing a detailed picture of the small-scale density fluctuations that gave rise to the large-scale structures we observe today."
