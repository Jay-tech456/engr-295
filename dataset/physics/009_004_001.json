    "message_1": "A student is conducting an experiment with a glass prism and has noticed that when the angle of incidence of light at the surface of the prism is greater than a certain value, the light is totally reflected back into the prism. The refractive index of the glass prism is given. What is the critical angle of incidence for the glass prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the critical angle of incidence for the glass prism, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. In this case, the two media are the glass prism and air. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of refraction must be 90 degrees. Let's denote the critical angle of incidence as θc and the refractive index of the glass prism as n.\n\nUsing Snell's Law:\n\nn * sin(θc) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nn * sin(θc) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle θc:\n\nsin(θc) = 1/n\n\nθc = arcsin(1/n)\n\nSo, the critical angle of incidence for the glass prism is θc = arcsin(1/n), where n is the given refractive index of the glass prism."
