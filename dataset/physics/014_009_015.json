    "message_2": "The expected frequency range of gravitational waves as predicted by general relativity depends on the astrophysical sources that produce them. These sources include binary systems of compact objects (such as neutron stars or black holes), supernovae, and the early universe's cosmic processes. The frequency range of gravitational waves can span from very low frequencies (around 10^-16 Hz) to very high frequencies (up to 10^4 Hz).\n\nFor example, the frequency range of gravitational waves produced by binary systems of compact objects, which are the primary targets for detectors like LIGO and Virgo, is typically between 10 Hz and a few kHz. The frequency of these waves increases as the objects spiral closer together and eventually merge.\n\nThe design and sensitivity of modern gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo are tailored to detect gravitational waves within this frequency range. LIGO and Virgo are ground-based interferometers that use laser beams to measure the tiny changes in the distance between mirrors caused by passing gravitational waves. These detectors are most sensitive in the frequency range of about 10 Hz to a few kHz, which matches the expected frequency range of gravitational waves from binary systems of compact objects.\n\nTo detect gravitational waves at lower frequencies, other types of detectors are being developed. For example, the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect gravitational waves in the frequency range of 10^-4 Hz to 10^-1 Hz, which will allow it to observe different types of astrophysical sources, such as massive black hole mergers and binary systems of compact objects in the early stages of their evolution.\n\nIn summary, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves as predicted by general relativity depends on the astrophysical sources, and the design and sensitivity of modern gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo are tailored to detect these waves within specific frequency ranges. This allows scientists to observe and study various astrophysical phenomena and further our understanding of the universe."
