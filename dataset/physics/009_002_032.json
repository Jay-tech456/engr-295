    "message_1": "A physics student is trying to conduct an experiment on the refraction of light. The experiment involves a glass block placed on a white sheet of paper with a light ray directed at it from air. If the angle of incidence is 40 degrees and the refractive index of the glass block is 1.5, what would be the angle of refraction inside the glass block?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction inside the glass block, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of the glass block), and θ1 = 40 degrees. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(40°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(40°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(θ2) = sin(40°) / 1.5\n\nNow, we can find the angle of refraction:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(40°) / 1.5)\n\nθ2 ≈ 24.9°\n\nSo, the angle of refraction inside the glass block is approximately 24.9 degrees."
