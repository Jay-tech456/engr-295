    "message_2": "The current leading theory about the nature of dark matter is that it consists of undiscovered subatomic particles, specifically Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making them invisible to our current detection methods. However, they do interact through gravity and weak nuclear force, which could explain the observed gravitational effects on galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nExperiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) play crucial roles in testing this theory. The LHC, a particle accelerator, is designed to collide particles at extremely high energies, potentially producing new particles, including WIMPs, if they exist. By analyzing the results of these collisions, physicists can search for evidence of dark matter particles and learn more about their properties.\n\nThe Dark Energy Survey, on the other hand, is an astronomical survey that aims to map the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. By observing the large-scale structure of the universe, including the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, the DES can provide indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter and help constrain its properties.\n\nBoth the LHC and DES experiments are complementary in their approaches to understanding dark matter. While the LHC searches for direct evidence of dark matter particles through high-energy collisions, the DES provides indirect evidence by studying the large-scale structure of the universe. Together, these experiments help physicists test the WIMP hypothesis and advance our understanding of the nature of dark matter."
