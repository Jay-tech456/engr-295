    "message_2": "The temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), or about -270.425 degrees Celsius. This temperature is derived from the blackbody radiation spectrum of the CMB, which is a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum with a peak wavelength of around 1.9 millimeters.\n\nThe CMB temperature is closely related to the Big Bang theory, as it provides strong evidence for this cosmological model. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. As the universe expanded, the radiation within it also cooled down and lost energy. The CMB is the relic radiation from this early hot phase of the universe, which has now cooled down to the observed temperature of 2.725 K.\n\nThe discovery of the CMB in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was a major milestone in the confirmation of the Big Bang theory. The nearly uniform temperature of the CMB across the sky, along with its blackbody spectrum, supports the idea that the universe was once in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling over time. Additionally, the tiny fluctuations in the CMB temperature (on the order of 10^-5 K) provide crucial information about the initial conditions and the large-scale structure of the universe."
