    "message_1": "A laser beam with a wavelength of 600 nm is diffracted through a single slit of width 0.025 mm. If the distance between the slit and the screen is 2.5 m, what is the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of bright fringes in single-slit diffraction:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the bright fringe, m is the order of the fringe (1 for the first bright fringe, 2 for the second bright fringe, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.025 mm = 0.025 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second bright fringes:\n\nθ1 = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.025 * 10^(-3))\nθ1 = 0.000024 rad\n\nθ2 = (2 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (0.025 * 10^(-3))\nθ2 = 0.000048 rad\n\nNext, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * θ\n\nwhere y is the linear distance on the screen, L is the distance between the slit and the screen, and θ is the angular position of the bright fringe.\n\ny1 = 2.5 * 0.000024 = 0.00006 m\ny2 = 2.5 * 0.000048 = 0.00012 m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first and second bright fringes:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = 0.00012 - 0.00006 = 0.00006 m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second bright fringes on the screen is 0.00006 m or 60 μm."
