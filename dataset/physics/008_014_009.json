Provide the theoretical calculation of the branching ratio and compare it with available experimental measurements.",
    "message_2": "The branching ratio of the rare decay process B→K(*)μ+μ− in the Standard Model of particle physics is a result of the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process, which is forbidden at the tree level. However, it can occur through higher-order loop diagrams, such as the electroweak penguin and box diagrams.\n\nThe theoretical calculation of the branching ratio involves several inputs, including the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, Wilson coefficients, form factors, and phase space factors. The differential branching ratio with respect to the dimuon invariant mass squared (q²) can be expressed as:\n\ndBR(B→K(*)μ+μ−)/dq² ∝ |C_eff|^2 * |F_K(*)|^2 * β(q²)\n\nHere, C_eff represents the effective Wilson coefficients, which include the contributions from the short-distance electroweak penguin and box diagrams. F_K(*) represents the form factors, which describe the hadronic matrix elements and depend on the specific decay mode (B→K or B→K*). β(q²) is the phase space factor, which depends on the kinematics of the decay.\n\nThe branching ratio can be obtained by integrating the differential branching ratio over the allowed range of q²:\n\nBR(B→K(*)μ+μ−) = ∫(dBR(B→K(*)μ+μ−)/dq²) dq²\n\nThe branching ratios for these decays in the Standard Model are predicted to be:\n\nBR(B→Kμ+μ−) ≈ (4.0 - 5.0) × 10^(-7)\nBR(B→K*μ+μ−) ≈ (1.0 - 1.5) × 10^(-6)\n\nThese theoretical predictions can be compared with the experimental measurements from the LHCb, Belle, and BaBar collaborations. The experimental results are generally consistent with the Standard Model predictions, with some deviations observed in certain kinematic regions (e.g., low q² region for B→K*μ+μ−). However, more precise measurements and theoretical calculations are needed to confirm whether these deviations are due to new physics beyond the Standard Model or are just statistical fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, the branching ratio of the rare decay process B→K(*)μ+μ− in the Standard Model can be calculated using higher-order loop diagrams, CKM matrix elements, Wilson coefficients, form factors, and phase space factors. The theoretical predictions are generally consistent with experimental measurements, but further studies are needed to explore potential deviations in specific kinematic regions."
