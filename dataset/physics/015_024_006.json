    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbital): f_orbital = (1 / 2π) * √(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW): f_GW = 2 * f_orbital\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h): h = (4 * G * M_chirp * (π * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\n\nHere, \n- M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg)\n- a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (in meters)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- c is the speed of light (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)\n- d is the distance from Earth (in meters)\n- M_chirp is the chirp mass, given by M_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kg. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg.\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 5 solar masses = 5 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to estimate the semi-major axis (a) of the binary system. For simplicity, we can assume that the black holes are in a circular orbit and use the following formula:\n\na = (G * (M1 + M2) / (4 * π^2 * f_orbital^2))^(1/3)\n\nHowever, we don't have the orbital frequency yet. We can estimate it using the following approximation for the last stable orbit before the merger of two black holes:\n\na = 6 * G * (M1 + M2) / c^2\n\na = 6 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.99792 x 10^8 m/s)^2\na ≈ 8.87 x 10^6 m\n\nNow we can calculate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / 2π) * √(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 2.19 x 10^-4 Hz\n\nThe gravitational wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbital\nf_GW ≈ 4.38 x 10^-4 Hz\n\nNext, we need to calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 6.76 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves. First, we need to convert the distance from Earth to meters:\n\n1 billion light-years = 1 x 10^9 light-years = 1 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 m ≈ 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * (π * f_GW)^2/3) / (c^4 * d)\nh ≈ 1.21 x 10^-22\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system is approximately 4.38 x 10^-4 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.21 x 10^-22."
