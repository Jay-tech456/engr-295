    "message_1": "A transformer is 10 cm long and has 1000 turns. It is supplied with a current of 5 A. Determine the magnetic field inside the transformer if the core has a relative permeability of 2000.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field inside the transformer, we can use Ampere's law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀), the relative permeability of the material (μr), the number of turns (N), and the current (I) divided by the length of the loop (l).\n\nThe formula for Ampere's law is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * μr * N * I) / l\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the transformer from centimeters to meters:\n\nl = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNext, we can plug in the given values:\n\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (permeability of free space)\nμr = 2000 (relative permeability of the core)\nN = 1000 turns\nI = 5 A\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 * 1000 * 5 A) / 0.1 m\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-4) T * 5) / 0.1 m\n\nB = (40π × 10^(-4) T) / 0.1 m\n\nB ≈ 12.57 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field inside the transformer is approximately 12.57 Tesla."
