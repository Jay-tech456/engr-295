    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of successful quantum teleportation, we need to know the initial state of the qubit to be teleported, the entangled pair of qubits used for teleportation, and the measurements made during the teleportation process.\n\nLet's denote the initial state of the qubit to be teleported as |ψ⟩, which can be represented as:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nHere, α and β are complex coefficients such that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider an entangled pair of qubits shared between Alice and Bob, which is in the Bell state:\n\n|Φ^+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nAlice has the qubit to be teleported (|ψ⟩) and one qubit from the entangled pair. Bob has the other qubit from the entangled pair.\n\nThe total state of the three qubits (Alice's qubit to be teleported, Alice's qubit from the entangled pair, and Bob's qubit from the entangled pair) can be represented as:\n\n|Ψ_total⟩ = |ψ⟩ ⊗ |Φ^+⟩ = (1/√2)(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell basis measurement on her two qubits. This measurement projects the total state into one of the four Bell states:\n\n1. |Φ^+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n2. |Φ^−⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ - |11⟩)\n3. |Ψ^+⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ + |10⟩)\n4. |Ψ^−⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ - |10⟩)\n\nThe probability of each outcome is given by the squared amplitude of the corresponding term in the total state. After Alice's measurement, the state of Bob's qubit will be one of the following, depending on the measurement outcome:\n\n1. α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n2. α|0⟩ - β|1⟩\n3. α|1⟩ + β|0⟩\n4. α|1⟩ - β|0⟩\n\nAlice then sends her measurement result (2 classical bits) to Bob. Based on this information, Bob can perform the necessary operations on his qubit to obtain the original state |ψ⟩:\n\n1. If Alice's measurement is |Φ^+⟩, Bob does nothing.\n2. If Alice's measurement is |Φ^−⟩, Bob applies a Z gate.\n3. If Alice's measurement is |Ψ^+⟩, Bob applies an X gate.\n4. If Alice's measurement is |Ψ^−⟩, Bob applies both X and Z gates.\n\nSince the success of quantum teleportation depends on the correct transmission of classical information and the application of the appropriate operations by Bob, the probability of successful teleportation is 1, assuming no errors in the process."
