    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency evolution of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses can be described in three main phases: inspiral, merger, and ringdown.\n\n1. Inspiral phase: In this phase, the two black holes are orbiting each other and gradually getting closer due to the emission of gravitational waves. The amplitude of the gravitational waves increases as the black holes get closer, and the frequency increases as the orbital period decreases. The evolution of the frequency (f) and amplitude (A) can be approximated using the following expressions:\n\nf(t) = (1/π) * (5/256)^(3/8) * (GM/c^3)^(-5/8) * t^(-3/8)\nA(t) = (4/c) * (GM/c^2)^(5/4) * (5GM/c^3)^(-1/4) * t^(-1/4)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system, c is the speed of light, and t is the time until coalescence.\n\n2. Merger phase: In this phase, the black holes are merging into a single black hole. The amplitude of the gravitational waves reaches its maximum value, and the frequency also reaches its peak. The exact evolution of the amplitude and frequency during this phase is more complex and depends on the specific details of the black hole masses and spins.\n\n3. Ringdown phase: After the merger, the newly formed black hole settles down to a stable state by emitting gravitational waves. The amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases exponentially, and the frequency also decreases. The evolution of the amplitude and frequency can be described using the following expressions:\n\nA(t) = A0 * exp(-t/τ)\nf(t) = f0 * exp(-t/τ)\n\nwhere A0 and f0 are the initial amplitude and frequency at the beginning of the ringdown phase, and τ is the damping time, which depends on the mass and spin of the final black hole.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with unequal masses evolve through three main phases: inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The amplitude increases during the inspiral phase, reaches its maximum during the merger phase, and then decreases exponentially during the ringdown phase. The frequency increases during the inspiral phase, reaches its peak during the merger phase, and then decreases during the ringdown phase."
