    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a point near a straight wire carrying a current, we can use Ampere's Law, specifically the Biot-Savart Law. The formula for the magnetic field strength (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the current I = 6.0 A and the distance r = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6.0 A) / (2 * π * 0.04 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6.0 A) / (2 * 0.04 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (24 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.08 m)\nB = 3 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a point 4.0 cm from the wire is 3 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
