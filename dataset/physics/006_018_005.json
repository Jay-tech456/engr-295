    "message_2": "To calculate the Auger decay width and the lifetime for the KVV and LMM Auger transitions in a copper atom, we need to know the theoretical values for the Auger decay rates and the shell-specific binding energies. \n\nFor copper, the shell-specific binding energies are as follows:\n- K-shell: E_K = 8.98 keV\n- L-shell: E_L = 0.93 keV\n- M-shell: E_M = 0.12 keV\n\nThe Auger decay rates for copper are:\n- KVV transition: Γ_KVV = 1.7 x 10^15 s^-1\n- LMM transition: Γ_LMM = 2.2 x 10^14 s^-1\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Auger decay width (Γ) for both transitions using the decay rates:\n\n1. KVV transition:\nΓ_KVV = 1.7 x 10^15 s^-1\n\n2. LMM transition:\nΓ_LMM = 2.2 x 10^14 s^-1\n\nNext, we'll calculate the lifetime (τ) for both transitions using the decay rates:\n\n1. KVV transition:\nτ_KVV = 1/Γ_KVV = 1/(1.7 x 10^15 s^-1) ≈ 5.88 x 10^-16 s\n\n2. LMM transition:\nτ_LMM = 1/Γ_LMM = 1/(2.2 x 10^14 s^-1) ≈ 4.55 x 10^-15 s\n\nSo, the Auger decay width and lifetime for the KVV and LMM Auger transitions in a copper atom are:\n\n- KVV transition: Γ_KVV = 1.7 x 10^15 s^-1 and τ_KVV ≈ 5.88 x 10^-16 s\n- LMM transition: Γ_LMM = 2.2 x 10^14 s^-1 and τ_LMM ≈ 4.55 x 10^-15 s"
