    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a black hole is given by the Penrose process, which is a theoretical method of extracting energy from a rotating black hole. The energy is extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole, and the process adheres to the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nIn the Penrose process, a particle falls into the ergosphere of the rotating black hole. The ergosphere is a region outside the event horizon where the spacetime is dragged along with the black hole's rotation. Within the ergosphere, the particle splits into two, with one part falling into the black hole and the other part escaping to infinity.\n\nThe escaping particle has more energy than the original particle, and this energy gain comes at the expense of the black hole's rotational energy. As a result, the black hole slows down. The maximum efficiency of this process is around 20.7%, which means that up to 20.7% of the black hole's mass can be converted into energy.\n\nThis process is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In the Penrose process, the energy is converted from the black hole's rotational energy to the kinetic energy of the escaping particle. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase. In this case, the entropy of the black hole increases as its rotational energy decreases, and the overall entropy of the system increases.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a black hole is given by the Penrose process, with an efficiency of up to 20.7%. This process is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, as it involves the conversion of energy from one form to another and an increase in the overall entropy of the system."
