    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves generated by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * π * 2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the masses of the two black holes are:\n\nM1 = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 3.978 x 10^31 kg) * π * 2)\nf ≈ 76 Hz\n\nThe frequency range of the gravitational waves generated by the merger of these two black holes is around 76 Hz.\n\nAs for the amplitude of the gravitational waves when detected on Earth, it depends on several factors, including the distance to the black hole merger and the sensitivity of the detectors. The amplitude of gravitational waves decreases as they propagate through space, so the farther away the merger is, the smaller the amplitude will be when the waves reach Earth.\n\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp * c^(-2))^(1/2) * (π * f * D)^(-1)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational waves, M_chirp is the chirp mass of the binary system (a combination of the masses of the two black holes), f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, D is the distance to the binary system, and the other variables are as previously defined.\n\nThe chirp mass can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_chirp = (M1 * M2)^(3/5) / (M1 + M2)^(1/5)\n\nFor our black holes:\n\nM_chirp = (1.989 x 10^31 kg * 3.978 x 10^31 kg)^(3/5) / (1.989 x 10^31 kg + 3.978 x 10^31 kg)^(1/5)\nM_chirp ≈ 2.692 x 10^31 kg\n\nTo calculate the amplitude, we need to know the distance to the binary system, which is not provided in the problem. However, we can express the amplitude as a function of distance:\n\nh(D) = (4 * G * 2.692 x 10^31 kg * c^(-2))^(1/2) * (π * 76 Hz * D)^(-1)\n\nThis formula gives the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves as a function of the distance to the black hole merger. The actual amplitude detected on Earth will depend on the sensitivity of the detectors and the distance to the merger."
