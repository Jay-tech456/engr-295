    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter significantly affects the strength and orientation of gravitational lensing observed in a galaxy cluster. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a distant source, such as a background galaxy, due to its gravitational influence. This bending of light causes the background galaxy to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light but has a significant gravitational influence on the visible matter in the universe. It is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while visible matter (stars, planets, etc.) accounts for only about 5%. The remaining 68% is dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nIn a galaxy cluster, dark matter is distributed throughout the cluster and forms a massive \"halo\" around it. This dark matter halo increases the total mass of the cluster, which in turn enhances the gravitational lensing effect. The strength of the lensing depends on the mass of the lensing object (in this case, the galaxy cluster including its dark matter component) and the alignment between the observer, the lens, and the background source.\n\nThe presence of dark matter also affects the orientation of the gravitational lensing. The distribution of dark matter within the cluster can be non-uniform, causing the lensing effect to be more pronounced in certain directions. This can lead to an asymmetric distortion of the background galaxy's image, which can provide valuable information about the distribution of dark matter within the galaxy cluster.\n\nBy studying the strength and orientation of gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, astronomers can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter. This is one of the primary methods used to detect and study dark matter, as it cannot be directly observed through telescopes due to its lack of interaction with light."
