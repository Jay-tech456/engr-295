    "message_2": "The Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition refers to the transition between the hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phases. This transition is expected to occur at high temperatures and densities, which can be achieved in heavy-ion collisions. Observable signatures of the QCD phase transition in heavy-ion collisions can be distinguished from other collision types such as proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions. Some of these signatures are:\n\n1. Jet quenching: In heavy-ion collisions, the produced QGP can cause a significant energy loss of high-energy partons (quarks and gluons) traversing the medium, leading to the suppression of high transverse momentum (pT) hadron production. This effect, known as jet quenching, is not expected in proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions where the QGP is not formed.\n\n2. Elliptic flow: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the initial spatial anisotropy of the collision zone leads to an anisotropic pressure gradient, which results in anisotropic particle emission, known as elliptic flow. The magnitude of elliptic flow is sensitive to the properties of the created medium, such as its viscosity. In proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions, the initial spatial anisotropy is much smaller, leading to weaker elliptic flow signals.\n\n3. Strangeness enhancement: The production of strange quarks is expected to be enhanced in the QGP due to the reduced mass threshold for strange quark-antiquark pair production. This leads to an increased production of strange and multi-strange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions, where strangeness production is mainly governed by the fragmentation of high-pT partons.\n\n4. Quarkonium suppression: Quarkonium states (bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, such as J/ψ or Υ) are expected to be suppressed in the QGP due to color screening, which reduces the binding potential between the heavy quarks. This effect is not expected in proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions, where the QGP is not formed.\n\n5. HBT (Hanbury-Brown-Twiss) interferometry: This technique measures the space-time extent of the particle-emitting source by analyzing the correlations between identical particles. In heavy-ion collisions, the source size extracted from HBT measurements can provide information about the lifetime and expansion dynamics of the QGP. In proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions, the source size is typically smaller and less sensitive to the QCD phase transition.\n\nIn summary, the observable signatures of the QCD phase transition in heavy-ion collisions, such as jet quenching, elliptic flow, strangeness enhancement, quarkonium suppression, and HBT interferometry, are distinct from those in proton-proton or proton-nucleus collisions, where the QGP is not expected to be formed. These signatures provide valuable information about the properties of the QGP and the QCD phase transition."
