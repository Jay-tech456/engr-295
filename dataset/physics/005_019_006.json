    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a velocity of 0.6c towards a planet which is emitting light waves of frequency 6 x 10^14 Hz. If the wavelength of the light waves is 5 x 10^-7 m, what will be the frequency and wavelength of the light waves as observed by an observer on board the spaceship? Determine also the distance between two consecutive wave crests as observed by the observer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the observer is on a spaceship moving towards the planet emitting the light waves.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler effect formula for frequency is:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the observed frequency on the spaceship\nf_emitted is the emitted frequency from the planet (6 x 10^14 Hz)\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.6c)\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf_observed = (6 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\nf_observed = (6 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\nf_observed = (6 x 10^14 Hz) * sqrt(4)\nf_observed = (6 x 10^14 Hz) * 2\nf_observed = 12 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the speed of light to find the observed wavelength:\n\nc = f_emitted * λ_emitted = f_observed * λ_observed\n\nwhere:\nλ_emitted is the emitted wavelength (5 x 10^-7 m)\nλ_observed is the observed wavelength on the spaceship\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for λ_observed, we get:\n\nλ_observed = (f_emitted * λ_emitted) / f_observed\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nλ_observed = ((6 x 10^14 Hz) * (5 x 10^-7 m)) / (12 x 10^14 Hz)\nλ_observed = (30 x 10^7 m) / (12 x 10^14 Hz)\nλ_observed = 2.5 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the observed frequency on the spaceship is 12 x 10^14 Hz, and the observed wavelength is 2.5 x 10^-7 m.\n\nThe distance between two consecutive wave crests as observed by the observer is the same as the observed wavelength, which is 2.5 x 10^-7 m."
