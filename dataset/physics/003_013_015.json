    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius R = 0.1 meters and the current I = 2 amps, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (8π x 10^-7 Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ (25.13 x 10^-7 T) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ 125.66 x 10^-7 T\n\nB ≈ 1.26 x 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is approximately 1.26 x 10^-5 Tesla."
