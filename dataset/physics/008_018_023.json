    "message_2": "To determine the value of the strong coupling constant (αs) at a specific energy scale, you would need to analyze the experimental data from the LHC experiment. This data would typically include cross-section measurements and particle production rates in proton-proton collisions at the given energy scale.\n\nThe strong coupling constant depends on the energy scale (Q) at which it is measured, and its value decreases as the energy scale increases. This behavior is known as asymptotic freedom. The relationship between αs and the energy scale is given by the renormalization group equation, which can be solved using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations.\n\nTo extract the value of αs from the experimental data, you would need to:\n\n1. Perform a global fit of the experimental data to the theoretical predictions from pQCD, taking into account the uncertainties in the data and the theoretical calculations.\n\n2. Determine the value of αs that provides the best agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions.\n\n3. Estimate the uncertainties in the extracted value of αs, considering both experimental and theoretical sources of uncertainty.\n\nWithout the specific experimental data from the LHC experiment, it is not possible to provide a numerical value for the strong coupling constant at the given energy scale. However, the current world-average value of αs at the Z boson mass scale (MZ ≈ 91.2 GeV) is approximately αs(MZ) ≈ 0.1181, with an uncertainty of about 0.0011. The value of αs at other energy scales can be obtained by solving the renormalization group equation using this reference value."
