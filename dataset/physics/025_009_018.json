    "message_2": "The human ear distinguishes between different frequencies of sound waves through a complex process involving several physical properties and structures within the ear. The primary components involved in this process are the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.\n\n1. Outer ear: The outer ear consists of the pinna (the visible part of the ear) and the ear canal. The pinna helps to collect and funnel sound waves into the ear canal. The shape of the pinna also helps to amplify certain frequencies and provides some directionality to the sound.\n\n2. Middle ear: The sound waves travel through the ear canal and reach the tympanic membrane (eardrum), causing it to vibrate. These vibrations are then transferred to three small bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), which amplify the sound and transmit it to the inner ear.\n\n3. Inner ear: The inner ear contains the cochlea, a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure that plays a crucial role in frequency detection. The cochlea is lined with the basilar membrane, which has varying stiffness and width along its length. When the stapes bone pushes on the oval window (a membrane-covered opening between the middle and inner ear), it creates pressure waves in the fluid within the cochlea.\n\nThe basilar membrane responds differently to these pressure waves depending on their frequency. High-frequency sounds cause the membrane to vibrate near the base (the narrower and stiffer part), while low-frequency sounds cause vibrations near the apex (the wider and more flexible part). This spatial separation of frequencies is known as tonotopy.\n\n4. Hair cells and nerve signals: Along the basilar membrane, there are specialized sensory cells called hair cells. These cells have tiny hair-like projections called stereocilia that move in response to the vibrations of the basilar membrane. The movement of the stereocilia triggers the release of neurotransmitters, which generate electrical signals in the auditory nerve. These signals are then sent to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as sound.\n\nIn summary, the human ear distinguishes between different frequencies of sound waves through a combination of mechanical vibrations, fluid pressure waves, and tonotopic organization within the cochlea. The physical properties involved in this process include the shape and stiffness of the basilar membrane, the movement of the hair cells, and the transmission of electrical signals to the brain."
