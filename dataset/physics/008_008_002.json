    "message_2": "The probability of detecting a supersymmetric particle in a proton-proton collision at a given energy level depends on several factors, including the energy of the collision, the specific supersymmetric particles involved, and the efficiency of the detectors used in the experiment.\n\nIn general, the probability can be estimated using the cross-section of the production process for the supersymmetric particles and the integrated luminosity of the proton-proton collisions. The cross-section is a measure of the likelihood of a specific process occurring, while the integrated luminosity represents the total number of collisions in the experiment.\n\nTo calculate the probability, you would need to know the specific supersymmetric particles you are looking for, their production cross-sections, and the integrated luminosity of the experiment. Additionally, you would need to account for the efficiency of the detectors and any background processes that could mimic the signal of the supersymmetric particles.\n\nIt is important to note that, so far, no supersymmetric particles have been detected in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or other particle colliders. This has led to increasingly stringent constraints on the properties of supersymmetric particles and their possible masses. However, the search for supersymmetry continues, as it is a promising candidate for explaining various open questions in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem."
