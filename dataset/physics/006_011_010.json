    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) of a hydrogen atom is the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in the ground state. It is given by the formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0ħ²) / (mee²)\n\nwhere ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/N·m²), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js), me is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg), and e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na0 = (4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12) * (1.054 x 10^(-34))^2) / (9.109 x 10^(-31) * (1.602 x 10^(-19))^2)\n\na0 ≈ 5.291 x 10^(-11) meters\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is approximately 5.291 x 10^(-11) meters."
