    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of a black hole is the radius of the event horizon, which is the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 3 × (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 5.967 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 × 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 × 5.967 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ (7.956 × 10^20 m^3 s^-2) / (8.988 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nRs ≈ 8.861 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 8,861 meters or 8.861 kilometers.\n\nThe significance of the Schwarzschild radius is that it defines the event horizon of a black hole. If an object is closer to the black hole than its Schwarzschild radius, it cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull, even if it is traveling at the speed of light. This is why black holes are \"black\" - no light can escape from within the event horizon, making them invisible to direct observation."
