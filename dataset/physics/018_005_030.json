    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an electron neutrino oscillating into a muon neutrino after traveling a distance of 500 km through vacuum, we need to know the initial energy of the neutrino and the mixing angle between the electron and muon neutrino states. Let's denote the initial energy as E and the mixing angle as θ.\n\nThe probability of neutrino oscillation is given by the formula:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere Δm² is the difference in the squared masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²), L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km), and E is the initial energy of the neutrino (in GeV).\n\nAssuming you have the values for the initial energy E, the mixing angle θ, and the mass squared difference Δm², you can plug them into the formula and calculate the probability of the electron neutrino oscillating into a muon neutrino after traveling 500 km through vacuum."
