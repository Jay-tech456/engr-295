    "message_2": "The latent heat of vaporization (L) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nL = Q / m\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed (2257 Joules) and m is the mass of the water (10 grams).\n\nL = 2257 J / 10 g = 225.7 J/g\n\nThe latent heat of vaporization of water is 225.7 Joules per gram."
