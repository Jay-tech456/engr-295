    "message_1": "Using X-ray diffraction, a student wants to determine the crystal structure of a new material. The student knows that the material contains only two types of atoms, has a lattice constant of 4.2 Å, and the X-ray wavelength used for the measurement is 1.54 Å. What is the crystal structure of this material?",
    "message_2": "To determine the crystal structure of the material, the student needs to analyze the X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the experiment. The diffraction pattern will provide information about the positions and intensities of the diffracted beams, which can be used to deduce the crystal structure.\n\nHowever, without the actual diffraction pattern data, it is impossible to determine the crystal structure of the material just based on the given information (lattice constant and X-ray wavelength). The material could have various crystal structures, such as simple cubic, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, or any other type of crystal structure.\n\nThe student should perform the X-ray diffraction experiment and analyze the obtained diffraction pattern to determine the crystal structure of the material."
