    "message_2": "The Penrose process is a mechanism by which energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole, specifically from its ergosphere. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a rotating black hole using the Penrose process is approximately 29% of the black hole's initial mass-energy.\n\nThe process involves the following steps:\n\n1. A particle enters the ergosphere of the rotating black hole.\n2. Inside the ergosphere, the particle splits into two smaller particles.\n3. One of the particles falls into the black hole, while the other escapes to infinity.\n4. The escaping particle has more energy than the original particle, which means that energy has been extracted from the black hole.\n\nThe energy extraction affects the black hole's mass and angular momentum as follows:\n\n1. Mass: The energy extracted from the black hole is equivalent to a decrease in its mass. This is due to the mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc^2). As energy is extracted, the mass of the black hole decreases.\n\n2. Angular momentum: The Penrose process also causes a decrease in the black hole's angular momentum. The particle that falls into the black hole has negative angular momentum relative to the black hole's rotation. This causes the black hole to lose angular momentum, slowing down its rotation.\n\nIn summary, the Penrose process allows for the extraction of up to 29% of a rotating black hole's initial mass-energy, which results in a decrease in both its mass and angular momentum."
