    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of energy levels in an atom due to the presence of an external magnetic field. In the case of hydrogen, we can calculate the energy splitting using the following formula:\n\nΔE = (μ_B * B) * (g_l * m_l + g_s * m_s)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy splitting, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (0.25 T), g_l and g_s are the Landé g-factors for the orbital and spin angular momenta, m_l and m_s are the magnetic quantum numbers for the orbital and spin angular momenta.\n\nFor hydrogen, g_l = 1 and g_s ≈ 2.0023 (approximately 2). The magnetic quantum numbers m_l and m_s can take the following values:\n\nm_l = -1, 0, 1 (for orbital angular momentum L = 1)\nm_s = -1/2, 1/2 (for spin angular momentum S = 1/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy splitting for each combination of m_l and m_s:\n\n1. m_l = -1, m_s = -1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (-1) + 2 * (-1/2))\nΔE = -2.3185 x 10^-23 J\n\n2. m_l = -1, m_s = 1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (-1) + 2 * (1/2))\nΔE = -4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\n3. m_l = 0, m_s = -1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (0) + 2 * (-1/2))\nΔE = -9.274 x 10^-24 J\n\n4. m_l = 0, m_s = 1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (0) + 2 * (1/2))\nΔE = 9.274 x 10^-24 J\n\n5. m_l = 1, m_s = -1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (1) + 2 * (-1/2))\nΔE = 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\n6. m_l = 1, m_s = 1/2\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.25 T) * (1 * (1) + 2 * (1/2))\nΔE = 2.3185 x 10^-23 J\n\nThese values represent the energy splitting for each combination of m_l and m_s in the presence of a 0.25 T magnetic field."
