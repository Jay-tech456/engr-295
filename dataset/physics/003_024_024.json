    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, and R is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven:\nI = 1.5 A\nN = 20 turns\nR = 8 cm = 0.08 m\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1.5 A * 20) / (2 * 0.08 m)\n\nB = (6π × 10^(-7) Tm * 20) / 0.16 m\n\nB = (120π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.16 m\n\nB ≈ 0.0002355 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the coil is approximately 0.0002355 Tesla."
