    "message_1": "A sodium atom is irradiated with light of wavelength 500 nm. A portion of the light with an intensity of 2.00 mW/m² falls on the surface of the metal and is absorbed by the electrons. Calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons from the sodium atom.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons, we need to use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nKE = hf - Φ\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), f is the frequency of the incident light, and Φ is the work function of the sodium atom.\n\nFirst, we need to find the frequency (f) of the incident light. We are given the wavelength (λ) of the light, which is 500 nm. We can use the speed of light (c) to find the frequency:\n\nc = λf\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s). Rearranging the equation to solve for f:\n\nf = c / λ\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5.00 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (5.00 x 10^-7 m) = 6.00 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNext, we need to find the work function (Φ) of the sodium atom. The work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material. For sodium, the work function is approximately 2.28 eV (electron volts). To use this value in our equation, we need to convert it to joules:\n\nΦ = 2.28 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.65 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons using the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nKE = hf - Φ\nKE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (6.00 x 10^14 Hz) - (3.65 x 10^-19 J)\nKE = 3.98 x 10^-19 J - 3.65 x 10^-19 J\nKE = 3.30 x 10^-20 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the ejected electrons from the sodium atom is approximately 3.30 x 10^-20 J."
