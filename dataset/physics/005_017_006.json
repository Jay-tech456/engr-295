    "message_1": "A particle is moving at a speed of 0.8c in a straight line towards a stationary target. What is the angle of deflection of the particle's trajectory as it passes the target?",
    "message_2": "To determine the angle of deflection of the particle's trajectory as it passes the target, we need more information about the interaction between the particle and the target. The angle of deflection depends on the forces acting on the particle as it approaches and passes the target.\n\nFor example, if the target is charged and the particle is also charged, then the electrostatic force between them will cause the particle to deflect. In this case, we would need to know the charges of the particle and the target, as well as the distance of closest approach between them, to calculate the angle of deflection.\n\nSimilarly, if the target has a magnetic field and the particle has a charge, then the magnetic force will cause the particle to deflect. In this case, we would need to know the magnetic field strength, the charge of the particle, and its velocity to calculate the angle of deflection.\n\nWithout more information about the interaction between the particle and the target, it is not possible to determine the angle of deflection of the particle's trajectory as it passes the target."
