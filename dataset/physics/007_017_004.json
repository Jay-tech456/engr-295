    "message_2": "The cross section for a neutron to cause fission in a uranium-235 nucleus at a thermal energy of 0.025 eV is approximately 584 barns (1 barn = 10^-24 cm^2). This value is obtained from experimental data and can be found in nuclear data tables.\n\nFor comparison, the cross section for a neutron to cause fission in a plutonium-239 nucleus at the same energy (0.025 eV) is approximately 748 barns.\n\nIn conclusion, the cross section for neutron-induced fission in plutonium-239 at a thermal energy of 0.025 eV is larger than that in uranium-235. This means that, at this energy, a neutron is more likely to cause fission in a plutonium-239 nucleus than in a uranium-235 nucleus."
