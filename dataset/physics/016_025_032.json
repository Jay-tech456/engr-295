    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field strength required for a superconductor to be used in a fusion reactor depends on the specific superconducting material and its critical temperature. In general, fusion reactors require very high magnetic field strengths to confine the plasma and maintain the necessary conditions for fusion to occur. \n\nFor example, in a tokamak fusion reactor, magnetic field strengths on the order of several tesla (T) are needed. High-temperature superconductors (HTS), such as yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) and bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO), are promising candidates for use in fusion reactors due to their ability to maintain superconductivity at higher temperatures and magnetic fields compared to conventional low-temperature superconductors (LTS) like niobium-titanium (NbTi) and niobium-tin (Nb3Sn).\n\nFor YBCO, the critical magnetic field strength can be as high as 100 T at low temperatures (around 10 K), while for BSCCO, it can be around 50 T at similar temperatures. However, the actual critical magnetic field strength required for a specific fusion reactor design will depend on factors such as the reactor's size, plasma confinement method, and operating conditions."
