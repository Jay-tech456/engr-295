    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the form of gravitational waves during the supernova explosion, we can use the formula derived by Einstein for the energy emitted in gravitational waves due to symmetric mass motion:\n\nE = (G/c^5) * (d^3 * I^2 * ω^6) * t\n\nwhere:\nE is the energy emitted in gravitational waves,\nG is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nc is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s),\nd is the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution,\nI is the moment of inertia of the star,\nω is the angular frequency of the oscillation,\nt is the duration of the emission.\n\nHowever, this formula is quite complex and requires knowledge of the quadrupole moment, moment of inertia, and angular frequency of the oscillation. Instead, we can use a simplified estimation for the energy released in gravitational waves during a supernova explosion:\n\nE ≈ 0.1 * M * c^2\n\nwhere:\nE is the energy emitted in gravitational waves,\nM is the mass of the star,\nc is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the star to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so a star with a mass of 20 times that of the sun would have a mass of:\n\nM = 20 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 3.978 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released in gravitational waves:\n\nE ≈ 0.1 * (3.978 × 10^31 kg) * (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 0.1 * (3.978 × 10^31 kg) * (8.987 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nE ≈ 3.578 × 10^48 kg m^2/s^2\nE ≈ 3.578 × 10^48 Joules\n\nSo, the approximate energy released in the form of gravitational waves during the supernova explosion of a star with a mass of 20 times that of the sun and a radius of 10 kilometers is about 3.578 × 10^48 Joules. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimation and the actual energy released could be different depending on various factors."
