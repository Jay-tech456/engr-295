    "message_1": "What is the probability that a neutron will be captured by a target nucleus, resulting in the formation of a compound nucleus and emission of gamma rays with energies between 1 and 2 MeV, given the cross-section data for the target nucleus in the evaluated nuclear data library? Additionally, the student should validate their results by comparing them with experimental measurements recorded in a database such as EXFOR.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of neutron capture and subsequent gamma-ray emission, we need to use the cross-section data provided in the evaluated nuclear data library. The cross-section data typically includes the total cross-section for neutron capture (σ_total) and the partial cross-sections for different gamma-ray energy ranges (σ_partial).\n\n1. First, find the partial cross-section (σ_partial) for gamma-ray emission between 1 and 2 MeV from the evaluated nuclear data library.\n\n2. Next, calculate the probability of neutron capture and gamma-ray emission in the specified energy range using the following formula:\n\nProbability = (σ_partial / σ_total) * 100\n\nThis will give you the probability in percentage.\n\n3. To validate the results, compare the calculated probability with experimental measurements available in a database such as EXFOR. This can be done by searching for the specific target nucleus and neutron energy in the database and checking if the experimental measurements match the calculated probability within the uncertainties.\n\nKeep in mind that the cross-section data and experimental measurements may have uncertainties associated with them, so the comparison should take these uncertainties into account. If the calculated probability is within the range of experimental measurements, it can be considered validated."
