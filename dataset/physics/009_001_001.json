    "message_1": "A physics student is standing in front of a plane mirror that is 1 meter tall. The student is 2 meters away from the mirror. If the student's eyes are 1.5 meters above the ground, what is the minimum height the mirror must be so that the student can see their entire body in the mirror standing 2 meters away from it? Assume the student's body is 1.5 meters tall.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum height of the mirror required for the student to see their entire body, we can use the law of reflection and similar triangles.\n\nLet's denote the height of the mirror as h, the distance between the student and the mirror as d, and the height of the student's eyes as e. In this case, d = 2 meters and e = 1.5 meters.\n\nWe can form two similar triangles: one with the height of the student's eyes and the distance to the mirror (1.5 meters and 2 meters), and another with the height of the mirror and the distance to the mirror (h meters and 2 meters).\n\nUsing the similar triangles, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(height of the student's eyes) / (distance to the mirror) = (height of the mirror) / (distance to the mirror)\ne / d = h / d\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n1.5 / 2 = h / 2\n\nNow, solve for h:\n\n1.5 * 2 = h * 2\n3 = h * 2\nh = 3 / 2\nh = 1.5 meters\n\nSo, the minimum height of the mirror must be 1.5 meters for the student to see their entire body while standing 2 meters away from it."
