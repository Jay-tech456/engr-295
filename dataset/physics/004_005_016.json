    "message_2": "The solution of the Einstein field equations for a static and spherically symmetric mass distribution in general relativity is known as the Schwarzschild solution or Schwarzschild metric. It is given by the following line element:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)\n\nwhere:\n- ds² is the spacetime interval\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- M is the mass of the spherically symmetric object\n- c is the speed of light\n- r, θ, and φ are the standard spherical coordinates\n- t is the time coordinate\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution describes the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass, such as a non-rotating star or a black hole. It is an important solution in general relativity and has been experimentally verified through various observations, such as the bending of light around massive objects and the precession of Mercury's orbit."
