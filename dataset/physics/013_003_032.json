    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first need to determine the redshift factor (z) that corresponds to the energy drop from 10^18 eV to 10^10 eV. The energy of a photon is given by the equation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. When the photon is redshifted, its energy decreases, and we can write the equation for the redshifted energy as:\n\nE' = h * f' = E / (1 + z)\n\nwhere E' is the redshifted energy, f' is the redshifted frequency, and z is the redshift factor. We can now solve for z:\n\nz = E / E' - 1 = (10^18 eV) / (10^10 eV) - 1 = 10^8 - 1\n\nNow that we have the redshift factor, we can use the relativistic Doppler formula to find the velocity of the cosmic ray relative to the Earth when its energy has dropped to 10^10 eV:\n\nv = c * (1 - (1 + z)^(-2))^(1/2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity and c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = c * (1 - (1 + 10^8 - 1)^(-2))^(1/2) ≈ 0.9999c\n\nSince the cosmic ray is moving at a constant velocity, we can use the equation for distance:\n\nd = v * t\n\nwhere d is the distance and t is the time it takes for the cosmic ray's energy to drop to 10^10 eV. To find t, we can use the equation:\n\nt = (1 + z) * t'\n\nwhere t' is the time in the rest frame of the cosmic ray. Since the cosmic ray is a proton, we can assume that its rest frame time is negligible compared to the time it takes for the energy to drop to 10^10 eV. Therefore, we can approximate t ≈ t':\n\nt ≈ (1 + 10^8 - 1) * 0 = 0\n\nSince the time is approximately zero, the distance the cosmic ray travels before its energy drops to 10^10 eV due to redshift is also approximately zero:\n\nd ≈ 0.9999c * 0 ≈ 0\n\nTherefore, the cosmic ray does not travel any significant distance before its energy drops to 10^10 eV due to redshift."
