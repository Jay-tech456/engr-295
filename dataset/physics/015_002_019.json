    "message_1": "What is the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger with a total mass of 3 solar masses and a distance of 400 Mpc from Earth?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the inspiral phase of the merger as a reference. During this phase, the two neutron stars orbit each other and lose energy due to the emission of gravitational waves, causing their orbits to shrink and their orbital frequency to increase.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase is twice the orbital frequency of the neutron stars. We can approximate the orbital frequency using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit:\n\nT^2 ∝ a^3\n\nThe proportionality constant depends on the total mass (M) of the system:\n\nT^2 = (4π^2/GM) * a^3\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nFor a neutron star merger, the semi-major axis (a) is very small, and the orbital period (T) is very short. As the neutron stars get closer, the orbital frequency (f_orbital) increases:\n\nf_orbital = 1/T\n\nThe frequency of the emitted gravitational waves (f_gravitational) is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_gravitational = 2 * f_orbital\n\nSince we don't have enough information to calculate the exact orbital frequency, we can only provide a rough estimate. For neutron star mergers, the gravitational wave frequency during the late inspiral phase is typically in the range of hundreds to thousands of Hz.\n\nIt's important to note that the distance of the merger from Earth (400 Mpc) does not affect the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. However, it does affect the amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth, making them weaker and more challenging to detect."
