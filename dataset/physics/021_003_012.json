    "message_2": "As matter and radiation approach the event horizon of a black hole, they experience extreme gravitational forces. These forces cause the matter and radiation to be stretched and compressed in a process known as spaghettification. This is due to the difference in gravitational forces acting on the near and far sides of the object, causing it to be stretched into a long, thin shape like a spaghetti strand.\n\nAs the matter and radiation get closer to the event horizon, their velocities increase, and they emit energy in the form of radiation. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation, which is a theoretical process where black holes can lose mass over time due to quantum effects near the event horizon.\n\nThe behavior of light is also affected as it passes by a black hole. Light, like any other object with mass or energy, is subject to the gravitational force of a black hole. When light passes close to a black hole, its path is bent due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the black hole's mass. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing.\n\nIf light gets too close to the event horizon, it can be trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape. This is why black holes appear black - they do not emit or reflect any light that can be detected by an observer. The boundary at which light can no longer escape the black hole's gravity is called the event horizon.\n\nIn summary, as matter and radiation approach the event horizon of a black hole, they experience extreme gravitational forces that cause spaghettification and emit Hawking radiation. The behavior of light is also affected as it passes by a black hole, with its path being bent due to gravitational lensing and potentially being trapped by the black hole's gravity at the event horizon."
