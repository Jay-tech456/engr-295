    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition, we can use the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/n1² - 1/n2²)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹), n1 and n2 are the initial and final energy levels of the electron, respectively (n1 < n2).\n\nIn this case, the electron transitions from n = 5 to n = 3, so n1 = 3 and n2 = 5.\n\n1/λ = R_H * (1/3² - 1/5²)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 * (1/9 - 1/25)\n1/λ = 1.097 x 10^7 * (16/225)\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = 1 / (1.097 x 10^7 * 16/225)\nλ ≈ 1.282 x 10^-6 m\n\nThe wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition is approximately 1.282 x 10^-6 meters, or 1282 nm."
