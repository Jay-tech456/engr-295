    "message_2": "When polarized light passes through a polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light. This relationship is described by Malus's Law:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(theta)\n\nwhere I_transmitted is the intensity of the transmitted light, I_incident is the intensity of the incident light, and theta is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light is 45 degrees. Therefore, we can calculate the intensity of the transmitted light as follows:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(45)\n\nSince cos(45) = 1/sqrt(2), we have:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * (1/sqrt(2))^2\nI_transmitted = I_incident * 1/2\n\nNow, to find the maximum possible reflection, we need to find the difference between the incident light intensity and the transmitted light intensity:\n\nI_reflected = I_incident - I_transmitted\nI_reflected = I_incident - (1/2)I_incident\nI_reflected = (1/2)I_incident\n\nSo, the maximum possible reflection of polarized light when it passes through a polarizer whose transmission axis is at an angle of 45 degrees to the incident polarization is 50% of the incident light intensity."
