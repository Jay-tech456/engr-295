    "message_2": "To calculate the resistivity of the copper wire, we can use the formula:\n\nResistivity (ρ) = Resistance (R) * Cross-sectional area (A) / Length (L)\n\nFirst, we need to find the resistance of the copper wire. The resistivity of copper at 20°C is approximately 1.68 x 10^-8 ohm meters. However, since the temperature is 25°C, we need to adjust the resistivity for temperature using the following formula:\n\nρ(T) = ρ(20°C) * [1 + α * (T - 20°C)]\n\nwhere α is the temperature coefficient of resistivity for copper, which is approximately 3.9 x 10^-3 K^-1.\n\nρ(25°C) = 1.68 x 10^-8 * [1 + 3.9 x 10^-3 * (25 - 20)]\nρ(25°C) ≈ 1.78 x 10^-8 ohm meters\n\nNow, we can find the resistance of the copper wire:\n\nR = ρ(25°C) * L / A\nR = (1.78 x 10^-8) * (10) / (0.5 x 10^-6)\nR ≈ 0.356 ohms\n\nFinally, we can calculate the resistivity of the copper wire:\n\nρ = R * A / L\nρ = 0.356 * (0.5 x 10^-6) / 10\nρ ≈ 1.78 x 10^-8 ohm meters\n\nSo, the resistivity of the copper wire at 25°C is approximately 1.78 x 10^-8 ohm meters."
