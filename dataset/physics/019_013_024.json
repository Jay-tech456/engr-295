    "message_2": "To calculate the instanton contribution to the vacuum energy of a U(1) gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions with a Chern-Simons term, we first need to write down the action for the theory. The action consists of the Maxwell term and the Chern-Simons term:\n\n$$S = S_{\\text{Maxwell}} + S_{\\text{CS}}$$\n\nThe Maxwell term in 2+1 dimensions is given by:\n\n$$S_{\\text{Maxwell}} = \\int d^3x \\, \\frac{1}{4e^2} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}$$\n\nwhere $F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu$ is the field strength tensor, and $e$ is the coupling constant.\n\nThe Chern-Simons term is given by:\n\n$$S_{\\text{CS}} = k \\int d^3x \\, \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} A_\\mu \\partial_\\nu A_\\rho$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Chern-Simons level, and $\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nNow, we need to find the instanton solutions, which are the classical solutions that minimize the action. For this, we need to solve the equations of motion derived from the action:\n\n$$\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta A_\\mu} = 0$$\n\nThe equation of motion for the gauge field $A_\\mu$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{e^2} \\partial_\\nu F^{\\nu\\mu} + k \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu A_\\rho = 0$$\n\nInstanton solutions are non-trivial solutions of the above equation that satisfy the boundary conditions:\n\n$$A_\\mu \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad r \\rightarrow \\infty$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radial coordinate in 2+1 dimensions.\n\nTo find the instanton solutions, we can use the ansatz:\n\n$$A_\\mu = \\frac{1}{g(r)} \\partial_\\mu f(r)$$\n\nwhere $g(r)$ and $f(r)$ are functions of the radial coordinate $r$. Substituting this ansatz into the equation of motion, we can find the functions $g(r)$ and $f(r)$ that satisfy the boundary conditions.\n\nOnce we have the instanton solutions, we can calculate the instanton contribution to the vacuum energy by evaluating the action on the instanton solutions:\n\n$$E_{\\text{inst}} = S(A_\\mu^{\\text{inst}})$$\n\nFinally, we can show that the instanton contribution to the vacuum energy is given by the product of the Chern-Simons level $k$ with a certain function of the coupling constant $e$. This function will depend on the specific form of the instanton solutions and can be determined by evaluating the action on the instanton solutions."
