    "message_2": "For nuclear fusion to occur in a plasma consisting of deuterium and tritium, the temperature and pressure must be extremely high to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. \n\nThe temperature required for deuterium-tritium fusion is typically around 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 million degrees Celsius). At this temperature, the plasma has enough kinetic energy for the nuclei to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and cause them to fuse.\n\nThe pressure required for nuclear fusion is more difficult to quantify, as it depends on factors such as confinement time and density of the plasma. In general, the pressure must be high enough to maintain the necessary temperature and density for a sufficient amount of time to achieve a self-sustaining fusion reaction. In experimental fusion reactors like tokamaks, the pressure can be on the order of several atmospheres or higher.\n\nIt is important to note that achieving these conditions for sustained nuclear fusion is still a significant challenge, and ongoing research is focused on developing practical methods for achieving and maintaining the required temperature and pressure in a controlled environment."
