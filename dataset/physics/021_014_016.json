    "message_2": "Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are the extremely bright and distant active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes at their centers. They are among the most luminous objects in the universe, emitting enormous amounts of energy, primarily in the form of light. The formation and intense brightness of quasars can be explained through the following processes:\n\n1. Accretion disk formation: When a supermassive black hole attracts nearby matter, such as gas and dust, the matter forms an accretion disk around the black hole. This disk is a rotating, flattened structure where the matter spirals inwards towards the black hole due to its strong gravitational pull.\n\n2. Friction and heating: As the matter in the accretion disk moves closer to the black hole, it experiences increasing friction and collisions with other particles. This friction generates a tremendous amount of heat, causing the particles to emit radiation in the form of light. The temperature of the accretion disk can reach millions of degrees, making it extremely bright.\n\n3. Relativistic jets: In some cases, a portion of the infalling matter does not get swallowed by the black hole but is instead ejected in the form of high-speed jets perpendicular to the accretion disk. These jets, composed of charged particles, can travel at nearly the speed of light and emit strong synchrotron radiation, which contributes to the overall brightness of the quasar.\n\n4. Gravitational energy conversion: The intense gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole converts the potential energy of the infalling matter into kinetic energy and radiation. This process is highly efficient, with up to 10% of the mass-energy of the infalling matter being converted into radiation. This efficiency is much higher than that of nuclear fusion in stars, which is around 0.7%.\n\nDespite the intense gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, the processes mentioned above allow quasars to shine brightly. The energy emitted by the accretion disk and relativistic jets can outshine the entire host galaxy, making quasars some of the most luminous objects in the universe."
