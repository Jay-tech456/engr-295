    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the particle, we can use the formula:\n\nF = q * v * B * sin(θ)\n\nwhere F is the magnetic force, q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the magnetic field strength, and θ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.\n\nGiven:\nq = +2.0 nC = 2.0 × 10^(-9) C\nv = 0.70 c = 0.70 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 2.1 × 10^8 m/s\nB = 1.5 T\n\nWe don't have information about the angle θ, so we'll assume the worst-case scenario, which is when the angle is 90 degrees (sin(90) = 1), and the magnetic force is at its maximum.\n\nF = (2.0 × 10^(-9) C) * (2.1 × 10^8 m/s) * (1.5 T) * sin(90)\nF = (2.0 × 10^(-9) C) * (2.1 × 10^8 m/s) * (1.5 T) * 1\nF = 6.3 × 10^(-1) N\nF ≈ 0.63 N\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the particle is approximately 0.63 N.\n\nFor the direction of the magnetic force, we can use the right-hand rule. Since the particle has a positive charge, the force will be in the direction of the thumb when the fingers of the right hand point in the direction of the velocity vector and are curled towards the direction of the magnetic field vector. Without information about the orientation of the magnetic field, we cannot determine the exact direction of the force. However, we know that it will be perpendicular to both the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector."
