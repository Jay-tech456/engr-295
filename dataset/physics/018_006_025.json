    "message_2": "The exact composition of dark matter and dark energy is still unknown and remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. However, I can provide you with the current understanding and theories about them.\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. It is believed to account for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. Although we cannot directly observe dark matter, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThere are several theories about the composition of dark matter. One leading candidate is Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with normal matter through gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force. Another candidate is axions, which are very light particles that could be produced in the early universe and could account for dark matter.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. It is estimated to account for about 68% of the mass-energy content of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but one possibility is that it is a property of space itself, represented by the cosmological constant in Einstein's equations of general relativity.\n\nDark energy does not interact with normal matter directly, but its influence on the expansion of the universe affects the distribution and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter, while not interacting with normal matter through electromagnetic forces, does interact through gravity. This gravitational interaction is responsible for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and filaments.\n\nIn summary, the exact composition of dark matter and dark energy is still unknown, and their interactions with normal matter are primarily through gravity and the expansion of the universe. Further research and observations are needed to uncover the true nature of these mysterious components of our universe."
