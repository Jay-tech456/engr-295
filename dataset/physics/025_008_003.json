    "message_2": "To find the force generated during a muscle contraction, we can use the formula:\n\nForce (F) = Tension (T) × Cross-sectional area (A)\n\nGiven the maximum tension (T) is 80 N/cm² and the cross-sectional area (A) is 50 cm², we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nF = 80 N/cm² × 50 cm²\n\nF = 4000 N\n\nTherefore, the force generated during a muscle contraction is 4000 Newtons."
