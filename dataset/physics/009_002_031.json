    "message_1": "A physics student wants to calculate the angle of refraction when a light ray passes from air (with an refractive index of 1.00) into a glass medium (with an refractive index of 1.50). The incident angle of the light ray from air is 30 degrees. What is the angle of refraction in the glass medium using Snell's Law?",
    "message_2": "Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this problem, we have n1 = 1.00 (air), n2 = 1.50 (glass), and θ1 = 30 degrees. We want to find θ2.\n\n1.00 * sin(30) = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.50 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.50:\n\n0.5 / 1.50 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.3333 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction in the glass medium is approximately 19.47 degrees."
