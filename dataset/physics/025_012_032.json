    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the binding of a ligand to a protein, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.\n\nOnce we have calculated the ΔG, we can determine the equilibrium constant (K_eq) using the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K_eq)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for K_eq, we get:\n\nK_eq = e^(-ΔG / RT)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values for ΔH, T, and ΔS to calculate ΔG and K_eq."
