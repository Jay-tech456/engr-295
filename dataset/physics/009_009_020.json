    "message_1": "A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of 20 cm. An object is placed in front of the mirror at a distance of 30 cm. Calculate the distance of the object's image from the mirror, the magnification, and the nature (real or virtual) of the image.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(3 + v) / (30v) = 1/10\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n10(3 + v) = 30v\n\n30 + 10v = 30v\n\nNow, solve for v:\n\n20v = 30\n\nv = 30/20 = 1.5\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 15 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -15/30 = -0.5\n\nThe magnification is -0.5, which means the image is inverted and half the size of the object.\n\nSince the magnification is negative and the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted."
