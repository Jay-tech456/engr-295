    "message_2": "The supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), has a significant impact on the motion of surrounding stars and the overall structure of the galaxy. With a mass of around 4 million times that of our Sun, the gravitational influence of Sgr A* plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the central region of the Milky Way.\n\n1. Impact on surrounding stars' motion: The gravitational pull of the SMBH causes nearby stars to orbit around it at high velocities. Observations have shown that some stars can reach speeds of up to thousands of kilometers per second as they move in their elliptical orbits around Sgr A*. These high-velocity stars can help us study the properties of the SMBH, such as its mass and distance from Earth.\n\n2. Impact on the overall structure of the galaxy: The presence of a SMBH at the center of a galaxy can influence the overall distribution of stars and gas in the galaxy. The strong gravitational force can cause gas to accumulate near the center, potentially triggering star formation and the growth of a dense central bulge. Additionally, the SMBH can interact with other massive objects, such as nearby stars or smaller black holes, leading to the ejection of these objects from the galactic center or even the merging of black holes.\n\nUnderstanding the role of black holes in galactic evolution can help us study and classify other galaxies. By observing the motion of stars and gas in the central regions of other galaxies, we can infer the presence of a SMBH and estimate its mass. This information can be used to classify galaxies based on the properties of their central black holes, such as mass and activity level.\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between the mass of a SMBH and the properties of its host galaxy, such as the mass of the central bulge or the total stellar mass, can provide insights into the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes. This can help us understand the processes that drive the growth of SMBHs and their influence on the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nIn summary, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy plays a significant role in shaping the motion of surrounding stars and the overall structure of the galaxy. By studying the role of black holes in galactic evolution, we can gain valuable insights into the formation and classification of other galaxies."
