    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas, we first need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nNext, we need the standard enthalpies of formation for all the substances involved in the reaction. We are given the values for CH4(g) and H2O(l), but we also need the values for O2(g) and CO2(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for O2(g) is 0 kJ/mol (since it is an element in its standard state), and the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2(g) is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nNow we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n\n∆H = [∑(moles of products × standard enthalpies of formation of products)] - [∑(moles of reactants × standard enthalpies of formation of reactants)]\n\n∆H = [(1 × -393.5) + (2 × -285.8)] - [(1 × -74.8) + (2 × 0)]\n\n∆H = (-393.5 - 571.6) - (-74.8)\n\n∆H = -965.1 + 74.8\n\n∆H = -890.3 kJ/mol\n\nThe enthalpy change for the combustion of methane gas at constant pressure is -890.3 kJ/mol."
