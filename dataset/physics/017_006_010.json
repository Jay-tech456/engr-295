    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field of a superconductor is the maximum magnetic field that a superconducting material can withstand while maintaining its superconducting state. When the magnetic field exceeds the critical magnetic field, the superconductor transitions to a normal (non-superconducting) state.\n\nThe critical magnetic field of a superconductor is temperature-dependent. As the temperature of the superconductor increases, the critical magnetic field decreases. This relationship can be described by the empirical formula known as the Ginzburg-Landau equation:\n\nH_c(T) = H_c(0) * (1 - (T/T_c)^2)\n\nwhere:\n- H_c(T) is the critical magnetic field at temperature T,\n- H_c(0) is the critical magnetic field at absolute zero temperature (0 K),\n- T is the temperature of the superconductor,\n- T_c is the critical temperature of the superconductor, which is the temperature at which the superconductor transitions from a normal state to a superconducting state.\n\nAccording to this equation, the critical magnetic field decreases as the temperature increases, and it becomes zero when the temperature reaches the critical temperature (T_c). At temperatures below T_c, the material is in a superconducting state, and at temperatures above T_c, it is in a normal state."
