    "message_2": "To calculate the expected duration of the gravitational waves produced during the merger of two neutron stars, we need to consider the inspiral phase of the merger, which is the phase when the two neutron stars are spiraling towards each other and emitting gravitational waves. The duration of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the neutron stars and their distance from the observer.\n\nLet's denote the masses of the neutron stars as m1 and m2, where m1 = m2 = 1.5 times the mass of the sun. The total mass M = m1 + m2 = 3 times the mass of the sun. The reduced mass μ = (m1 * m2) / M. Since m1 = m2, μ = (1.5 * 1.5) / 3 = 0.75 times the mass of the sun.\n\nThe chirp mass, which is a combination of the masses that determines the evolution of the inspiral, is given by:\n\nMc = μ^(3/5) * M^(2/5)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nMc = (0.75)^(3/5) * (3)^(2/5) ≈ 1.19 times the mass of the sun.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for the neutron stars to merge, known as the coalescence time. The coalescence time is given by:\n\nTc ≈ 5/256 * (c^5 / (G^3 * M * Mc^2)) * (r^4 / M^4)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, r is the distance between the neutron stars, and M is the total mass.\n\nHowever, we are given the distance between the observer and the source (400 Mpc), not the distance between the neutron stars. The distance between the neutron stars does not directly affect the duration of the gravitational waves observed. Therefore, we can calculate the duration of the gravitational waves without knowing the distance between the neutron stars.\n\nThe coalescence time formula can be simplified as:\n\nTc ≈ 5/256 * (c^5 / (G^3 * M^3)) * (1 / Mc^2)\n\nPlugging in the values for c, G, M, and Mc, and converting the mass of the sun to kilograms, we get:\n\nTc ≈ 5/256 * ((3 * 10^8 m/s)^5 / ((6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2)^3 * (3 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^3)) * (1 / (1.19 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^2)\n\nTc ≈ 1.57 * 10^-3 seconds\n\nSo, the expected duration of the gravitational waves produced during the merger of the two neutron stars is approximately 1.57 milliseconds. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual duration may vary depending on various factors such as the initial distance between the neutron stars, their spins, and the eccentricity of their orbits."
