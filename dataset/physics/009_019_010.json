    "message_1": "What is the distance between the two slits in Young's Double Slit Experiment if a monochromatic light with a wavelength of 600 nm creates an interference pattern on a screen that has a separation of 1 meter from the slits, and the 3rd bright fringe is located at an angle of 0.034 radians with respect to the central maximum? (Assuming the distance from the slits to the screen is much larger than the distance between the two slits.)",
    "message_2": "In Young's Double Slit Experiment, the condition for constructive interference (bright fringes) is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two slits, θ is the angle of the fringe with respect to the central maximum, m is the order of the fringe (m = 1 for the first bright fringe, m = 2 for the second, etc.), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following information:\n\n- λ = 600 nm = 6 * 10^(-7) m\n- The screen is 1 meter away from the slits.\n- The 3rd bright fringe (m = 3) is located at an angle of 0.034 radians.\n\nWe are asked to find the distance between the two slits (d). Since the distance from the slits to the screen is much larger than the distance between the two slits, we can use the small angle approximation:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ\n\nSo, the equation for constructive interference becomes:\n\nd * θ = m * λ\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for d:\n\nd * 0.034 = 3 * (6 * 10^(-7))\n\nd = (3 * (6 * 10^(-7))) / 0.034\n\nd ≈ 5.29 * 10^(-5) m\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two slits in this experiment is approximately 5.29 * 10^(-5) meters or 52.9 micrometers."
