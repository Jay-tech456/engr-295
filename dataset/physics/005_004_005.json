    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic energy and momentum of the spaceship, we will use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic energy (E) = γmc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n2. Relativistic momentum (p) = γmv, where v is the velocity of the spaceship.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ) using the equation:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nGiven that the spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.6c, we can substitute v = 0.6c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = γmc^2\nE = 1.25 * 5000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 9.375 * 10^17 Joules\n\nNext, we can calculate the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = γmv\np = 1.25 * 5000 kg * 0.6c\np = 1.25 * 5000 kg * 0.6 * (3 * 10^8 m/s)\np ≈ 1.125 * 10^12 kg m/s\n\nSo, the relativistic energy of the spaceship is approximately 9.375 * 10^17 Joules, and the relativistic momentum is approximately 1.125 * 10^12 kg m/s."
