    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of a hydrogen atom in its first excited state (n=2), we can use the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, which is related to the probability of an atom transitioning from a higher energy level to a lower one while emitting radiation.\n\nThe Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission (A) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA = (64π^4 * e^2 * f) / (3h * c^3 * λ^3)\n\nwhere:\n- e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C)\n- f is the oscillator strength (for the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen, f ≈ 0.416)\n- h is the Planck's constant (6.63 × 10^-34 Js)\n- c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s)\n- λ is the wavelength of the emitted radiation (656.3 nm)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 656.3 nm × (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.563 × 10^-7 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the Einstein coefficient A:\n\nA = (64π^4 * (1.6 × 10^-19 C)^2 * 0.416) / (3 * (6.63 × 10^-34 Js) * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^3 * (6.563 × 10^-7 m)^3)\nA ≈ 4.577 × 10^7 s^-1\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of the hydrogen atom in its first excited state is the inverse of the Einstein coefficient:\n\nτ = 1 / A\nτ ≈ 1 / (4.577 × 10^7 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 2.183 × 10^-8 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of a hydrogen atom in its first excited state (n=2) emitting radiation of wavelength 656.3 nm is approximately 2.183 × 10^-8 seconds."
