    "message_2": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Orbital frequency (f_orbit):\n\nf_orbit = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes (in kg), and r is the distance between them (in meters).\n\n2. Gravitational wave frequency (f_GW):\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbit\n\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * G * M_chirp / (c^2 * d)) * (pi * f_GW * G * M_chirp / c^3)^2/3\n\nwhere M_chirp is the chirp mass, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and d is the distance from the observer to the binary system (assumed to be much larger than the orbital separation).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms:\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 30 solar masses = 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = ((M1 * M2)^(3/5)) / ((M1 + M2)^(1/5))\n\nNow, we can calculate the orbital frequency, gravitational wave frequency, and amplitude:\n\n1. Orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbit = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / r^3)\nf_orbit ≈ 1.55 Hz\n\n2. Gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf_GW = 2 * f_orbit\nf_GW ≈ 3.10 Hz\n\n3. Gravitational wave amplitude:\n\nh ≈ (4 * G * M_chirp / (c^2 * d)) * (pi * f_GW * G * M_chirp / c^3)^2/3\n\nSince the distance d from the observer to the binary system is not given, we cannot calculate the exact amplitude. However, the formula above can be used to estimate the amplitude for a given distance.\n\nIn summary, the expected gravitational wave frequency is approximately 3.10 Hz, and the amplitude depends on the distance from the observer to the binary system."
