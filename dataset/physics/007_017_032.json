    "message_2": "To calculate the cross section (σ) for the nuclear reaction (n,γ) on a target nucleus of nitrogen-14 (14N) at a neutron energy of 2 MeV, we need to use the following formula:\n\nσ = (πħ²)/(2μE) * (2Jf + 1)/(2Ji + 1) * |<Jf||M||Ji>|²\n\nwhere:\n- ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π, where h = 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js)\n- μ is the reduced mass of the neutron-nucleus system\n- E is the neutron energy (2 MeV)\n- Ji and Jf are the initial and final angular momenta of the nucleus\n- |<Jf||M||Ji>|² is the square of the reduced matrix element of the nuclear transition operator M\n\nFirst, we need to find the reduced mass (μ) of the neutron-nucleus system. The reduced mass is given by:\n\nμ = (mn * mN) / (mn + mN)\n\nwhere mn is the mass of the neutron (1.0087 amu) and mN is the mass of the nitrogen-14 nucleus (14.0031 amu). Converting these masses to kilograms (1 amu = 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg):\n\nmn = 1.0087 amu * 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg/amu = 1.675 x 10^(-27) kg\nmN = 14.0031 amu * 1.66054 x 10^(-27) kg/amu = 2.325 x 10^(-26) kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the reduced mass:\n\nμ = (1.675 x 10^(-27) kg * 2.325 x 10^(-26) kg) / (1.675 x 10^(-27) kg + 2.325 x 10^(-26) kg) = 1.573 x 10^(-27) kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the neutron energy from MeV to Joules:\n\nE = 2 MeV * (1.60218 x 10^(-13) J/MeV) = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J\n\nNow, we need to determine the initial and final angular momenta of the nucleus (Ji and Jf). For nitrogen-14, the ground state has a spin-parity of 1+ (Ji = 1). In the (n,γ) reaction, the neutron is captured, and the resulting nitrogen-15 nucleus can be in various excited states. For simplicity, let's assume the first excited state with a spin-parity of 1/2- (Jf = 1/2).\n\nFinally, we need the square of the reduced matrix element of the nuclear transition operator M, |<Jf||M||Ji>|². This value depends on the specific nuclear structure and is typically obtained from experimental data or theoretical calculations. For the sake of this problem, let's assume |<Jf||M||Ji>|² = 0.01.\n\nNow we can calculate the cross section:\n\nσ = (πħ²)/(2μE) * (2Jf + 1)/(2Ji + 1) * |<Jf||M||Ji>|²\nσ = (π * (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js / 2π)²) / (2 * 1.573 x 10^(-27) kg * 3.204 x 10^(-13) J) * (2 * 1/2 + 1)/(2 * 1 + 1) * 0.01\nσ ≈ 2.61 x 10^(-29) m²\n\nSo, the cross section for the nuclear reaction (n,γ) on a target nucleus of nitrogen-14 (14N) at a neutron energy of 2 MeV is approximately 2.61 x 10^(-29) m². Keep in mind that this value is a rough estimate, as the matrix element and other factors can vary depending on the specific reaction and nuclear structure."
