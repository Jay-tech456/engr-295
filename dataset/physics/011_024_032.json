    "message_2": "The electronic structure of a topological insulator (TI) differs from that of a conventional insulator in several key ways, which give rise to its unique transport properties. In a conventional insulator, the valence and conduction bands are separated by a bandgap, and there are no conducting states within this gap. In contrast, a topological insulator has an insulating bulk but possesses conducting surface states that are topologically protected, meaning they are robust against perturbations and impurities.\n\nBand Structure:\nIn a conventional insulator, the band structure consists of fully filled valence bands and empty conduction bands separated by a bandgap. The Fermi level lies within the bandgap, and there are no available electronic states for conduction.\n\nIn a topological insulator, the band structure also has a bandgap between the valence and conduction bands. However, the crucial difference is the presence of topologically protected surface states that cross the bandgap. These surface states form a Dirac cone, where the valence and conduction bands touch at a single point (the Dirac point), and the Fermi level lies within this Dirac cone.\n\nFermi Surface:\nThe Fermi surface is a constant-energy surface in momentum space that separates occupied and unoccupied electronic states at the Fermi level. In a conventional insulator, the Fermi surface is absent because the Fermi level lies within the bandgap, and there are no available electronic states for conduction.\n\nIn a topological insulator, the Fermi surface consists of closed loops or lines that encircle the Dirac points of the topologically protected surface states. These surface states are characterized by a non-trivial topological invariant, which ensures their robustness against perturbations and impurities.\n\nTheoretical Models:\nThe Kane-Mele model and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model are two theoretical models that describe the electronic structure of topological insulators. The Kane-Mele model is based on graphene and incorporates spin-orbit coupling to generate a topological insulating phase with protected edge states. The BHZ model describes the band structure of a two-dimensional topological insulator with a strong spin-orbit coupling, which leads to the formation of topologically protected surface states.\n\nExperimental Evidence:\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique used to study the electronic structure of topological insulators. ARPES measurements have provided direct evidence of the topologically protected surface states and their Dirac cone dispersion in various topological insulators, such as Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3.\n\nIn summary, the electronic structure of a topological insulator differs from that of a conventional insulator due to the presence of topologically protected surface states that cross the bandgap, forming a Dirac cone. These surface states give rise to unique transport properties, such as robustness against perturbations and impurities, and have been supported by both theoretical models and experimental evidence."
