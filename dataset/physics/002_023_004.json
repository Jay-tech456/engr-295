    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nWe are given the temperature T2 (50°C) and the enthalpy of vaporization (40.7 kJ/mol). We need to find the vapor pressure P2 at this temperature. To do this, we need to know the vapor pressure P1 at a known temperature T1. We can use the normal boiling point of water (100°C) as our reference point. At this temperature, the vapor pressure of water is equal to 1 atm (101.325 kPa).\n\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K\nP1 = 101.325 kPa\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40700 J/mol\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/323.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 12.33 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 50°C with an enthalpy of vaporization of 40.7 kJ/mol is approximately 12.33 kPa."
