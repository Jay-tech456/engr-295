    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic susceptibility of a specific material, we need to know the material's properties and its response to the applied magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibility (Ï‡) is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.\n\nIn general, the magnetic susceptibility can be calculated using the Curie-Weiss law for paramagnetic materials or the Langevin function for diamagnetic and ferromagnetic materials. However, without knowing the specific material and its properties, we cannot provide an exact value for the magnetic susceptibility.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the material and its properties, we can help you calculate the magnetic susceptibility."
