    "message_2": "To calculate the Jeans mass (M_J) and Jeans radius (R_J) of a molecular cloud, we can use the following formulas:\n\nM_J = (4 * pi * (rho) * (R_J)^3) / 3\nR_J = sqrt((15 * k_B * T) / (4 * pi * G * (rho) * (mu) * m_H))\n\nwhere:\nrho = density of the molecular cloud (10^3 atoms/m^3)\nT = temperature of the molecular cloud (50 K)\nmu = mean molecular weight (2.33)\nk_B = Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K)\nG = gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2)\nm_H = mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Jeans radius (R_J):\n\nR_J = sqrt((15 * (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) * 50 K) / (4 * pi * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2) * (10^3 atoms/m^3) * 2.33 * (1.67 x 10^-27 kg)))\nR_J ≈ 1.22 x 10^4 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the Jeans mass (M_J):\n\nM_J = (4 * pi * (10^3 atoms/m^3) * (1.22 x 10^4 m)^3) / 3\nM_J ≈ 7.23 x 10^13 kg\n\nSo, the Jeans mass of the molecular cloud is approximately 7.23 x 10^13 kg, and the Jeans radius is approximately 1.22 x 10^4 m."
