    "message_2": "To find the energy difference between the n = 3 and n = 2 energy levels in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the n = 3 level:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the n = 2 level:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 ≈ -3.4 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels is:\n\nΔE = E_3 - E_2 = -1.51 eV - (-3.4 eV) ≈ 1.89 eV\n\nNow, we can use the energy-wavelength relationship to find the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted during the transition:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s), c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nλ = (4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s) * (2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s) / 1.89 eV ≈ 6.564 × 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted during the transition from n = 3 to n = 2 is approximately 656.4 nm."
