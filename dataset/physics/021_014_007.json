    "message_2": "The relationship between the mass of a black hole and the luminosity of the quasar it powers can be described using the Eddington luminosity. The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity a celestial body (like a quasar) can achieve when there is a balance between the gravitational force pulling material inwards and the radiation pressure pushing material outwards.\n\nThe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nL_Edd = (4πG * M * c) / κ\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the mass of the black hole\n- c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- κ is the opacity, which is the measure of how easily radiation can pass through the material (approximately 0.34 cm^2 g^-1 for electron scattering in a hydrogen plasma)\n\nThe mass of the black hole is directly proportional to the Eddington luminosity. As the mass of the black hole increases, so does the Eddington luminosity, which means the quasar it powers will also become more luminous. However, it is important to note that not all black holes power quasars, and the actual luminosity of a quasar depends on various factors, such as the accretion rate of the material falling into the black hole and the efficiency of the energy conversion process."
