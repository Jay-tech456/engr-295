    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. The most precise experimental measurement of the strong coupling constant to date is αs(MZ) = 0.1181 ± 0.0011, where MZ is the mass of the Z boson. This value was obtained by the Particle Data Group (PDG) in their 2020 review, which combines various experimental measurements from high-energy physics experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nTheoretical predictions of the strong coupling constant are based on perturbative QCD calculations and lattice QCD simulations. The current theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. For example, a recent lattice QCD calculation gives a value of αs(MZ) = 0.11852(69), which is consistent with the PDG value.\n\nIt is important to note that both experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the strong coupling constant are continually being refined as new data and improved methods become available. The ongoing efforts to reduce uncertainties in the determination of αs are crucial for testing the validity of the Standard Model of particle physics and for exploring potential new physics beyond the Standard Model."
