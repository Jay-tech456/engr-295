    "message_2": "High-energy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are some of the most energetic and luminous events in the universe. They are short-lived, lasting from a few milliseconds to several minutes, and are detected in the gamma-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The exact mechanisms behind the emission of GRBs are still not completely understood, but there are two leading models that explain their origin: the collapsar model and the merger model.\n\n1. Collapsar model: This model suggests that GRBs are produced during the core-collapse of massive stars, specifically those with a mass greater than 25-30 solar masses. When the core of such a star collapses, it forms a black hole or a neutron star, and the outer layers of the star fall inward. The infalling material forms an accretion disk around the compact object, and the release of gravitational energy heats up the disk. This process generates a pair of highly relativistic jets, which are ejected along the rotational axis of the star. When these jets interact with the surrounding medium, they produce gamma-ray photons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, resulting in a gamma-ray burst.\n\n2. Merger model: This model proposes that GRBs are produced during the merger of two compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. The merger process leads to the formation of a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. Similar to the collapsar model, the release of gravitational energy heats up the disk, and a pair of relativistic jets are ejected. These jets interact with the surrounding medium and produce gamma-ray photons, resulting in a gamma-ray burst.\n\nQuasars, on the other hand, are extremely luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. They emit energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including gamma rays. However, the gamma-ray emission from quasars is not in the form of short-lived bursts like GRBs. Instead, it is a continuous emission that can last for millions of years.\n\nWhile quasars and GRBs both involve the accretion of matter onto black holes and the production of relativistic jets, they are distinct phenomena. Quasars are associated with supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, while GRBs are related to the core-collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects. Therefore, quasars do not play a direct role in the production of gamma-ray bursts."
