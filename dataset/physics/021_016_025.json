    "message_2": "The presence of one or multiple black holes can have significant effects on the distribution and structure of the cosmic web. The cosmic web is a large-scale structure of the universe, consisting of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and dark matter, interconnected by filaments of baryonic matter and dark matter. Here are some changes that can be observed due to the presence of black holes:\n\n1. Gravitational influence: Black holes, especially supermassive ones, have strong gravitational effects on their surroundings. They can attract nearby matter, including gas, dust, and even stars, altering the distribution of matter in the cosmic web. This can lead to the formation of denser regions around the black holes, which may eventually evolve into galaxy clusters or larger structures.\n\n2. Galaxy formation and evolution: Black holes play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can release enormous amounts of energy in the form of radiation and jets. This energy can heat up the surrounding gas, preventing it from cooling and forming new stars. This feedback mechanism can regulate the growth of galaxies and influence their structure.\n\n3. Mergers and interactions: When two or more galaxies containing black holes collide or interact, their black holes can eventually merge, forming a more massive black hole. This process releases gravitational waves and can also trigger star formation and other processes that reshape the structure of the cosmic web.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: Black holes can bend light due to their strong gravitational fields, acting as gravitational lenses. This can cause the appearance of multiple images or distortions of background galaxies, providing valuable information about the distribution of mass in the cosmic web.\n\n5. Cosmic voids: The presence of black holes can influence the formation and evolution of cosmic voids, which are large, underdense regions in the cosmic web. The gravitational pull of black holes can draw matter away from these voids, making them even more underdense and affecting the overall structure of the cosmic web.\n\nIn summary, the presence of one or multiple black holes can significantly impact the distribution and structure of the cosmic web through various processes, including gravitational influence, galaxy formation and evolution, mergers and interactions, gravitational lensing, and the formation of cosmic voids."
