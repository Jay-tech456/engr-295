    "message_1": "What is the change in free energy (ΔG) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at a temperature of 37°C and a pH of 7.4 if the reaction has a standard free energy change (ΔG°) of -45 kJ/mol? Assume that the substrate concentration is at equilibrium and that the enzyme is operating at maximum velocity.",
    "message_2": "If the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is at equilibrium, then the change in free energy (ΔG) is equal to zero. This is because, at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and there is no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products.\n\nIn this case, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) of -45 kJ/mol represents the free energy change under standard conditions (1 M concentrations of reactants and products, 1 atm pressure, and 25°C temperature). However, since the reaction is at equilibrium and the enzyme is operating at maximum velocity, the actual free energy change (ΔG) is zero."
