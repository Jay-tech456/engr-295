    "message_1": "A 3m-long, 40cm-diameter cylinder is filled with water and suspended horizontally by two cables. The cylinder is then struck by a sound wave with a frequency of 2000Hz, creating vibrations. Calculate the amplitude of the resulting vibrations if the natural frequency of the cylinder-water system is 1800Hz.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of the resulting vibrations, we need to consider the resonance phenomenon. When the frequency of the external force (sound wave) is close to the natural frequency of the system (cylinder-water), the amplitude of the vibrations increases significantly. The amplitude can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA = F0 / (k - mω^2)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, F0 is the amplitude of the external force, k is the spring constant of the system, m is the mass of the system, and ω is the angular frequency of the external force.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to calculate the amplitude directly. We need to know the amplitude of the external force (F0) and the spring constant (k) or the mass (m) of the system.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the system, such as the mass of the cylinder and water, or the spring constant, we can proceed with the calculation."
