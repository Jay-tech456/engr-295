    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of dimensions 0.2 m x 0.1 m carries a current of 2 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a rectangular loop, we can break the problem into four segments (the four sides of the rectangle). We will calculate the magnetic field due to each segment and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the four corners of the rectangle as follows: A (bottom left), B (bottom right), C (top right), and D (top left). The dimensions are AB = 0.2 m and AD = 0.1 m. The current is flowing counterclockwise.\n\n1. Segment AB:\nThe magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing into the plane (using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of the magnetic field can be found using the formula:\n\ndB_AB = (μ₀ * I * AD) / (4π * r_AB²)\n\nwhere r_AB is the distance from the center of the loop to the middle of segment AB.\n\n2. Segment BC:\nThe magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing out of the plane (using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of the magnetic field can be found using the formula:\n\ndB_BC = (μ₀ * I * AD) / (4π * r_BC²)\n\nwhere r_BC is the distance from the center of the loop to the middle of segment BC.\n\n3. Segment CD:\nThe magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing into the plane (using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of the magnetic field can be found using the formula:\n\ndB_CD = (μ₀ * I * AB) / (4π * r_CD²)\n\nwhere r_CD is the distance from the center of the loop to the middle of segment CD.\n\n4. Segment DA:\nThe magnetic field due to this segment will be pointing out of the plane (using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of the magnetic field can be found using the formula:\n\ndB_DA = (μ₀ * I * AB) / (4π * r_DA²)\n\nwhere r_DA is the distance from the center of the loop to the middle of segment DA.\n\nNow, we can notice that dB_AB = dB_CD and dB_BC = dB_DA due to symmetry. Therefore, the total magnetic field at the center of the loop will be the sum of the magnetic fields due to segments AB and BC (or CD and DA):\n\nB_total = dB_AB + dB_BC\n\nWe can calculate the distances r_AB and r_BC:\n\nr_AB = AD / 2 = 0.1 m / 2 = 0.05 m\nr_BC = AB / 2 = 0.2 m / 2 = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field magnitudes:\n\ndB_AB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m) / (4π * (0.05 m)²) = 1.6 × 10^(-5) T (into the plane)\ndB_BC = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 0.1 m) / (4π * (0.1 m)²) = 4 × 10^(-6) T (out of the plane)\n\nFinally, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop:\n\nB_total = dB_AB - dB_BC = 1.6 × 10^(-5) T - 4 × 10^(-6) T = 1.2 × 10^(-5) T (into the plane)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 1.2 × 10^(-5) T, and its direction is into the plane."
