    "message_2": "The relativistic wave equation for a free particle is given by the Klein-Gordon equation, which is derived from the energy-momentum relation in special relativity. The energy-momentum relation is:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nThe Klein-Gordon equation is:\n\n(∇^2 - (1/c^2) ∂^2/∂t^2) ψ(x, t) = (m^2 c^2/ħ^2) ψ(x, t)\n\nwhere ψ(x, t) is the wave function of the particle, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ∇^2 is the Laplacian operator.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the wave function can be written as a product of a spatial part and a temporal part:\n\nψ(x, t) = ψ_s(x) ψ_t(t)\n\nPlugging this into the Klein-Gordon equation, we get:\n\n(∇^2 ψ_s(x)) ψ_t(t) - (1/c^2) (ψ_s(x) ∂^2 ψ_t(t)/∂t^2) = (m^2 c^2/ħ^2) ψ_s(x) ψ_t(t)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by ψ_s(x) ψ_t(t) to separate the variables:\n\n(1/ψ_s(x)) ∇^2 ψ_s(x) - (1/c^2) (1/ψ_t(t)) ∂^2 ψ_t(t)/∂t^2 = m^2 c^2/ħ^2\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call k:\n\n(1/ψ_s(x)) ∇^2 ψ_s(x) = k\n(1/c^2) (1/ψ_t(t)) ∂^2 ψ_t(t)/∂t^2 = k - m^2 c^2/ħ^2\n\nNow, we can solve these two ordinary differential equations separately. The spatial part is a standard eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian operator, and its solutions are plane waves:\n\nψ_s(x) = e^(i p·x/ħ)\n\nwhere p is the momentum vector.\n\nThe temporal part is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its solutions are complex exponentials:\n\nψ_t(t) = e^(-i Et/ħ)\n\nwhere E is the energy.\n\nNow, we can combine the spatial and temporal parts to get the full solution to the relativistic wave equation for a free particle:\n\nψ(x, t) = ψ_s(x) ψ_t(t) = e^(i (p·x - Et)/ħ)\n\nThis is the solution to the relativistic wave equation for a free particle of energy E and momentum p."
