    "message_2": "To find the image distance and magnification of the object, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave lens, the focal length is negative. So, f = -10 cm.\nThe object distance, u = -15 cm (negative because the object is on the same side as the light source).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(-15 - 10) / (10 * 15) = 1/v\n\n-25 / 150 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to find v:\n\nv = -150 / 25\n\nv = -6 cm\n\nThe image distance is -6 cm, which means the image is formed 6 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-6)/(-15)\n\nM = 6/15\n\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification of the object is 2/5 or 0.4. This means the image is 0.4 times the size of the object and is diminished and upright since the magnification is positive."
