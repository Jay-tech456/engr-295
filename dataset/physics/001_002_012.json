    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js).\n\nFirst, we need to find the momentum of the electron. We can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.62607015 × 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the electron. Rearranging the formula to solve for p:\n\np = h / λ\n\nGiven the wavelength λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10^-9 m, we can find the momentum:\n\np = (6.62607015 × 10^-34 Js) / (500 × 10^-9 m)\np ≈ 1.32521403 × 10^-27 kg m/s\n\nNow, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx):\n\nΔx ≥ ħ / (2 * Δp)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1.32521403 × 10^-27 kg m/s)\nΔx ≈ 3.9793105 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) is approximately 3.98 × 10^-11 m, and the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is approximately 1.33 × 10^-27 kg m/s."
