    "message_2": "The maximum efficiency of energy extraction from a rotating black hole through the Penrose process is approximately 20.7%. This value is derived from the angular momentum of the black hole, which is related to its mass and spin.\n\nThe Penrose process occurs in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole, where particles can have negative energy with respect to an observer at infinity. When a particle with negative energy falls into the black hole, the conservation of energy and angular momentum causes the black hole to lose energy and angular momentum, effectively transferring energy to the escaping particle.\n\nThe efficiency of this process depends on the black hole's angular momentum, which is determined by its mass (M) and dimensionless spin parameter (a). The maximum efficiency is achieved when the black hole has the maximum possible spin, which is when a = 1 (a black hole with a spin parameter between 0 and 1 is considered to be a Kerr black hole).\n\nFor a maximally spinning black hole (a = 1), the maximum efficiency of the Penrose process can be calculated as:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - sqrt(1 - a^2)) / (1 + sqrt(1 - a^2))\n\nWhen a = 1, the efficiency is approximately 20.7%.\n\nIt is important to note that this maximum efficiency is a theoretical value, and actual energy extraction from a rotating black hole would likely be lower due to various factors, such as the presence of an accretion disk and the complexity of the process itself."
