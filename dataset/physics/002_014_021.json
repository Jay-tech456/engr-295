    "message_1": "A refrigerator operates between 233K and 303K and uses 800 J of work to remove 400 J of heat from inside the refrigerator. Calculate the efficiency of the refrigerator.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of the refrigerator, we need to use the Coefficient of Performance (COP) formula for refrigerators:\n\nCOP = Q_cold / W\n\nwhere Q_cold is the amount of heat removed from the inside of the refrigerator (400 J) and W is the work done by the refrigerator (800 J).\n\nCOP = 400 J / 800 J = 0.5\n\nThe efficiency of the refrigerator is 0.5 or 50%."
