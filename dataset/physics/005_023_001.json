    "message_2": "To calculate the radius of the event horizon for a black hole, we use the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (radius of the event horizon), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole into kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 6.7 billion suns * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/sun) = 6.7 x 10^9 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg ≈ 1.333 x 10^40 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 1.333 x 10^40 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nR_s ≈ 1.975 x 10^13 m\n\nNow, we need to account for the observer's motion relative to the black hole at a speed of 0.8c. According to special relativity, the length contraction formula is:\n\nL = L_0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length (in this case, the contracted Schwarzschild radius), L_0 is the proper length (the Schwarzschild radius), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nL = 1.975 x 10^13 m * sqrt(1 - (0.8 * 3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nL ≈ 1.975 x 10^13 m * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL ≈ 1.975 x 10^13 m * sqrt(0.36)\nL ≈ 1.975 x 10^13 m * 0.6\nL ≈ 1.185 x 10^13 m\n\nSo, the radius of the event horizon for a black hole with a mass of 6.7 billion suns, as observed by an observer in motion relative to the black hole at a speed of 0.8c, is approximately 1.185 x 10^13 meters."
