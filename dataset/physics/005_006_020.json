    "message_1": "A physics student is required to determine the gravitational redshift experienced by an object in free fall from a height of 50 meters above the Earth's surface. The object is being observed by an observer on the ground using a laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm. Assuming the gravitational acceleration is constant, calculate the wavelength of the light observed by the object just before it hits the ground.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the gravitational redshift experienced by the object, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nΔλ/λ = GM/c^2 * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the Earth (5.972 × 10^24 kg), c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), R1 is the initial distance from the center of the Earth, and R2 is the final distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to find R1 and R2. The Earth's radius is approximately 6,371,000 meters. So:\n\nR1 = Earth's radius + height = 6,371,000 m + 50 m = 6,371,050 m\nR2 = Earth's radius = 6,371,000 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2 * (1/6,371,050 m - 1/6,371,000 m)\n\nΔλ/λ = 4.464 × 10^-10\n\nNow, we can find the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = λ * (Δλ/λ) = 632.8 nm * 4.464 × 10^-10 = 2.825 × 10^-7 nm\n\nFinally, we can find the new wavelength observed by the object just before it hits the ground:\n\nλ_new = λ + Δλ = 632.8 nm + 2.825 × 10^-7 nm = 632.8000002825 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the light observed by the object just before it hits the ground is approximately 632.8000002825 nm."
