    "message_2": "When a star comes close to a black hole, its orbit and trajectory can be significantly affected due to the strong gravitational pull of the black hole. The interaction between the star and the black hole depends on several factors, including the mass and distance of the black hole, as well as the star's own mass and speed.\n\n1. Mass of the black hole: The more massive the black hole, the stronger its gravitational pull. This means that a more massive black hole will have a greater effect on the star's orbit and trajectory. A star passing close to a massive black hole may experience significant changes in its orbit, such as being captured into an elliptical or highly eccentric orbit around the black hole, or even being flung out of the system entirely.\n\n2. Distance from the black hole: The closer the star is to the black hole, the stronger the gravitational pull it experiences. As the star gets closer to the black hole, the gravitational force increases, which can lead to more significant changes in the star's orbit and trajectory. If the star gets too close to the black hole, it may experience tidal forces strong enough to tear it apart, a process known as tidal disruption.\n\n3. Mass of the star: The mass of the star also plays a role in the interaction with the black hole. A more massive star will experience a stronger gravitational pull from the black hole, which can lead to more significant changes in its orbit and trajectory. However, a more massive star is also more resistant to tidal disruption due to its stronger self-gravity.\n\n4. Speed of the star: The speed of the star as it approaches the black hole can also impact the interaction. A faster-moving star has more kinetic energy, which can help it resist being captured by the black hole's gravity. However, if the star is moving too fast, it may not be able to escape the black hole's gravitational pull and could be captured into a highly eccentric orbit or even be flung out of the system entirely.\n\nIn summary, the effect of a black hole on a star's orbit and trajectory depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, as well as the star's own mass and speed. The interaction can result in changes to the star's orbit, capture into an eccentric orbit around the black hole, or even ejection from the system. In extreme cases, the star may be torn apart by tidal forces if it gets too close to the black hole."
