    "message_2": "To find the minimum frequency of light required to emit an electron from a silver atom, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nThe energy required to emit an electron from a silver atom is equal to the work function, which is given as 4.63 eV. We need to convert this energy from electron volts to joules:\n\nE = 4.63 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 7.42 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow we can solve for the frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (7.42 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 1.12 x 10^15 Hz\n\nSo the minimum frequency of light required to emit an electron from a silver atom is approximately 1.12 x 10^15 Hz."
