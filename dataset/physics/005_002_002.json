    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the moving object, we can use the formula for length contraction:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the rest length (100 meters), v is the relative velocity (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value inside the square root:\n\n1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.36c^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the contracted length:\n\nL = 100 meters * sqrt(0.64) = 100 meters * 0.8 = 80 meters\n\nSo, the length of the moving object in the direction of its motion when it is travelling at a speed of 0.6c relative to an observer is 80 meters."
