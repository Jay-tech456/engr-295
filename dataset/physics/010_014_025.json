    "message_2": "To determine the change in static pressure due to a shock wave, we can use the normal shock relations. For a given Mach number (M1) before the shock, the ratio of static pressure after the shock (P2) to the static pressure before the shock (P1) can be determined using the following formula:\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * γ * M1^2 - (γ - 1)) / (γ + 1)\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the ratio of specific heats for air, which is approximately 1.4.\n\nGiven the Mach number M1 = 2.5:\n\nP2/P1 = (2 * 1.4 * (2.5)^2 - (1.4 - 1)) / (1.4 + 1)\nP2/P1 ≈ 4.5\n\nThis means that the static pressure after the shock is 4.5 times the static pressure before the shock.\n\nNow, we need to find the static pressure at sea level (P1). The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 101325 Pa (Pascals).\n\nSince the shock wave is generated by an aircraft flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet, the pressure at that altitude will be different from the sea level pressure. However, the problem asks for the change in static pressure at sea level, so we can assume that the shock wave has propagated down to sea level and use the sea level pressure as our initial pressure (P1).\n\nNow we can find the static pressure after the shock at sea level (P2):\n\nP2 = P1 * (P2/P1)\nP2 = 101325 Pa * 4.5\nP2 ≈ 456462.5 Pa\n\nFinally, we can find the change in static pressure (ΔP):\n\nΔP = P2 - P1\nΔP ≈ 456462.5 Pa - 101325 Pa\nΔP ≈ 355137.5 Pa\n\nSo, the change in the static pressure of air at sea level when it is subjected to a shock wave of Mach 2.5 generated by a supersonic aircraft flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet is approximately 355,137.5 Pa."
