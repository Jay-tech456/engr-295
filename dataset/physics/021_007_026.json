    "message_2": "The proximity of a black hole can significantly affect the orbit of a nearby celestial body, such as a planet or a star, due to its strong gravitational pull. The interaction between the black hole and the celestial body can lead to various observable consequences. Here are some key points:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: A black hole has an extremely strong gravitational field, which can cause nearby celestial bodies to be attracted towards it. This can result in the celestial body's orbit becoming distorted or elongated, potentially leading to an unstable orbit.\n\n2. Tidal forces: The difference in gravitational pull between the side of the celestial body closest to the black hole and the side farthest away can create tidal forces. These forces can cause the celestial body to stretch and compress, potentially leading to tidal heating and, in extreme cases, the disintegration of the celestial body.\n\n3. Accretion disk formation: If a celestial body gets too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart by the black hole's tidal forces. The material from the celestial body can then form an accretion disk around the black hole. As the material in the accretion disk spirals inwards, it heats up and emits radiation, which can be observed as X-rays or other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\n\n4. Gravitational waves: The interaction between a black hole and a nearby celestial body can cause the emission of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime. These waves can be detected by observatories such as LIGO and Virgo, providing valuable information about the masses and properties of the interacting objects.\n\n5. Orbital decay: The emission of gravitational waves can cause the orbit of the celestial body to decay, meaning it gradually spirals closer to the black hole. This process can eventually lead to the merging of the two objects, with the celestial body being consumed by the black hole.\n\n6. Gravitational lensing: The strong gravitational field of a black hole can bend light from a more distant object, causing the object to appear distorted or magnified. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to study the properties of the black hole and its environment.\n\nIn summary, the proximity of a black hole can significantly affect the orbit and properties of a nearby celestial body, leading to various observable consequences such as accretion disk formation, gravitational waves, and gravitational lensing. These interactions provide valuable insights into the nature of black holes and their effects on the surrounding environment."
