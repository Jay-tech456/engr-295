    "message_2": "To determine the mass ratio of a binary neutron star system emitting gravitational waves, we can use the chirp mass formula and the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. The chirp mass (M_c) is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. The mass ratio (q) is defined as:\n\nq = m2 / m1\n\nThe frequency of the emitted gravitational waves (f) is related to the chirp mass by the following equation:\n\nf = (5/8Ï€) * (GM_c/c^3)^(5/8) * (t_c - t)^(3/8)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, t_c is the time of coalescence, and t is the time before coalescence.\n\nGiven the waveform frequency (f) of 100 Hz and amplitude (A) of 10^-22, we can estimate the chirp mass. However, without more information about the time to coalescence or the individual masses of the neutron stars, we cannot directly determine the mass ratio.\n\nTo obtain the mass ratio, additional information about the binary system or the masses of the neutron stars is required."
