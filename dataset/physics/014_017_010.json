    "message_2": "The maximum energy that a cosmic ray particle can possess is around 10^20 electron volts (eV). Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. They travel at nearly the speed of light and can interact with Earth's atmosphere, producing secondary particles such as muons, electrons, and neutrinos.\n\nCosmic rays can affect electronics on Earth, particularly in devices with miniaturized components and low voltage levels. The high-energy particles can cause single-event effects (SEEs) in electronic devices, which can lead to temporary or permanent malfunctions. Some examples of electronic devices that can be impacted by cosmic rays include:\n\n1. Microprocessors and memory chips: Cosmic rays can cause bit flips in memory cells, changing the stored data. This can lead to software crashes or incorrect data processing. In microprocessors, cosmic rays can cause transient faults, leading to incorrect calculations or system crashes.\n\n2. Satellite electronics: Satellites are particularly vulnerable to cosmic rays due to their exposure to higher radiation levels in space. Cosmic rays can cause SEEs in satellite components, leading to data corruption, loss of communication, or even complete satellite failure.\n\n3. Avionics systems: Aircraft electronics, especially those in high-altitude flights, can be affected by cosmic rays. SEEs in avionics systems can lead to navigation errors, communication failures, or other system malfunctions.\n\n4. Power grid systems: Cosmic rays can induce currents in power lines and transformers, causing voltage fluctuations and potentially damaging equipment.\n\nThe mechanisms behind the effects of cosmic rays on electronic devices are mainly due to ionization and charge deposition. When a high-energy cosmic ray particle interacts with a semiconductor material, it can generate electron-hole pairs, creating a transient current. This current can cause a voltage glitch or a change in the stored data, leading to the aforementioned single-event effects.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of cosmic rays on electronics, engineers use various techniques such as error detection and correction codes, redundant systems, and radiation-hardened components. These measures help to ensure the reliability and proper functioning of electronic devices in the presence of cosmic rays."
