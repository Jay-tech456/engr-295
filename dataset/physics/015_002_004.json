    "message_2": "To find the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two neutron stars just before they collide, we can use the Kepler's third law of planetary motion and the fact that the frequency of gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency.\n\nFirst, let's find the orbital frequency. According to Kepler's third law:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere T is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis (half the distance between the two stars), G is the gravitational constant, and M1 and M2 are the masses of the two neutron stars.\n\nGiven that the distance between the two neutron stars is 10 km, the semi-major axis (a) is 5 km. We also need to convert the masses of the neutron stars from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n\nM1 = M2 = 1.4 solar masses = 1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.7846 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug in the values into Kepler's third law equation:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * (5 x 10^3 m)^3) / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (2.7846 x 10^30 kg + 2.7846 x 10^30 kg))\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT ≈ 0.000102 seconds\n\nNow we can find the orbital frequency (f_orbital):\n\nf_orbital = 1 / T ≈ 1 / 0.000102 s ≈ 9806 Hz\n\nFinally, the frequency of gravitational waves (f_gravitational) is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_gravitational = 2 * f_orbital ≈ 2 * 9806 Hz ≈ 19612 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the two neutron stars just before they collide and merge into a black hole is approximately 19,612 Hz."
