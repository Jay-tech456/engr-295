    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the running of the fine structure constant (α) with respect to the energy scale (Q) can be calculated using perturbative methods. At one-loop order, the running of α is determined by the renormalization group equation (RGE). The RGE for the running coupling constant in QED at one-loop order is given by:\n\ndα/d(log Q) = β(α),\n\nwhere β(α) is the beta function.\n\nFor QED, the one-loop beta function is:\n\nβ(α) = (e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * α^2,\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the RGE as:\n\ndα/d(log Q) = (e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * α^2.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can separate variables and integrate:\n\n∫(dα / α^2) = ∫(e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) d(log Q).\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-1/α = (e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q) + C,\n\nwhere C is the integration constant.\n\nNow, we can solve for α as a function of Q:\n\nα(Q) = -1 / ((e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q) + C).\n\nTo determine the integration constant C, we can use the initial condition at a reference energy scale Q0:\n\nα(Q0) = α0,\n\nwhere α0 is the fine structure constant at the reference energy scale Q0. Plugging this into the equation above, we get:\n\nα0 = -1 / ((e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q0) + C).\n\nSolving for C, we obtain:\n\nC = -1/α0 - (e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q0).\n\nFinally, we can write the running fine structure constant as a function of the energy scale Q:\n\nα(Q) = -1 / ((e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q) - 1/α0 - (e^2 / (12π^2)) * (4π) * log(Q0)).\n\nThis equation describes the running of the fine structure constant in QED at one-loop order as a function of the energy scale Q."
