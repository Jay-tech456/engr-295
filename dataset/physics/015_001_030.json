    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula for the dimensionless strain amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / (c⁴ * D)\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\n- M is the total mass of the system (20 + 30 = 50 solar masses)\n- ω is the angular frequency of the orbit\n- r is the separation between the black holes (500 km)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\n- D is the distance from the observer to the system\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses and distance to SI units:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg\n50 solar masses = 50 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 9.945 × 10³¹ kg\n\n500 km = 500 * 10³ m = 5 × 10⁵ m\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) of the orbit. We can use Kepler's third law to find the orbital period (T):\n\nT² = (4 * π² * r³) / (G * M)\n\nT² = (4 * π² * (5 × 10⁵ m)³) / (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 9.945 × 10³¹ kg)\nT ≈ 0.0015 s\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = 2 * π / T\nω ≈ 4194.4 s⁻¹\n\nFinally, we can calculate the dimensionless strain amplitude (h):\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 9.945 × 10³¹ kg * (4194.4 s⁻¹)² * 5 × 10⁵ m) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴ * D\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) depends on the distance (D) from the observer to the system. To get a specific value for h, you would need to provide the distance to the binary black hole system."
