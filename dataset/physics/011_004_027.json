    "message_1": "Calculate the thermal conductivity of a copper rod with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 2 cm, if the temperature difference between both of its ends is 100 °C. The heat energy supplied to one end of the rod is 100 J/s. The specific heat and density of copper are 385 J/kg K and 8,960 kg/m³, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity (k) of the copper rod, we can use the formula for the rate of heat transfer through the rod, which is given by Fourier's law:\n\nQ = (k * A * ΔT) / L\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer rate (100 J/s), A is the cross-sectional area of the rod, ΔT is the temperature difference between the ends of the rod (100 °C), and L is the length of the rod (50 cm or 0.5 m).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area (A) of the rod. Since the rod has a circular cross-section, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the rod (1 cm or 0.01 m). \n\nA = π * (0.01 m)²\nA ≈ 3.14 * 0.0001 m²\nA ≈ 0.000314 m²\n\nNow we can plug the values into Fourier's law equation and solve for the thermal conductivity (k):\n\n100 J/s = (k * 0.000314 m² * 100 °C) / 0.5 m\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = (100 J/s * 0.5 m) / (0.000314 m² * 100 °C)\nk ≈ (50 J/m) / (0.0314 °C)\nk ≈ 1592.36 W/m·K\n\nThe thermal conductivity of the copper rod is approximately 1592.36 W/m·K."
