    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the focal length of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 20 cm, using the formula 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance and di is the image distance. The student places an object 10 cm away from the mirror and measures the distance of the resulting image. What is the focal length of the concave mirror?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the focal length (f) of the concave mirror using the relation between the radius of curvature (R) and the focal length. For a concave mirror, the focal length is half the radius of curvature:\n\nf = R/2\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, the focal length is:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we have the object distance (do) which is 10 cm. We can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (di):\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nSubstitute the values of f and do:\n\n1/10 = 1/10 + 1/di\n\nNow, we need to solve for di:\n\n1/di = 1/10 - 1/10 = 0\n\nSince 1/di = 0, this means di is infinite. In this case, the object is placed at the focal point of the concave mirror, and the image is formed at infinity."
