    "message_2": "The electronic band structure of graphene plays a crucial role in determining its electrical conductivity at different temperatures. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, and its unique electronic properties arise from its linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points in the Brillouin zone.\n\nThe band structure of graphene consists of two bands, the valence band and the conduction band, which touch each other at the Dirac points. This makes graphene a zero-bandgap semiconductor or a semimetal. The linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points gives rise to massless Dirac fermions, which are responsible for the high electrical conductivity of graphene.\n\nAt low temperatures, the electrical conductivity of graphene is dominated by the contribution from the massless Dirac fermions. Due to their unique properties, these fermions lead to a minimum conductivity in graphene, which is independent of the carrier concentration and temperature. This minimum conductivity is a universal property of graphene and has been experimentally observed.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the thermal excitation of carriers across the Dirac points becomes more significant. This leads to an increase in the carrier concentration and, consequently, an increase in the electrical conductivity of graphene. However, at very high temperatures, the increased carrier scattering due to lattice vibrations (phonons) can cause the electrical conductivity to decrease.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the electronic band structure of graphene and its electrical conductivity at different temperatures can be described as follows:\n\n1. At low temperatures, the conductivity is dominated by the massless Dirac fermions, leading to a minimum conductivity that is independent of temperature and carrier concentration.\n2. At moderate temperatures, the conductivity increases due to the thermal excitation of carriers across the Dirac points.\n3. At very high temperatures, the conductivity may decrease due to increased carrier scattering by lattice vibrations (phonons).\n\nOverall, the unique electronic band structure of graphene, characterized by the linear dispersion relation and massless Dirac fermions, is responsible for its exceptional electrical conductivity properties at different temperatures."
