    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel through the universe at nearly the speed of light. They were first discovered in 1912 by physicist Victor Hess, who found that the ionization of the Earth's atmosphere increased with altitude, indicating the presence of these energetic particles.\n\nThe origin of cosmic rays can be traced to several sources:\n\n1. Supernova remnants: The most widely accepted source of cosmic rays is the remnants of supernovae, which are the explosive deaths of massive stars. When a star explodes, it releases a tremendous amount of energy and accelerates particles to extremely high speeds. These particles then propagate through the interstellar medium and contribute to the cosmic ray flux.\n\n2. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): These are the central regions of galaxies that contain supermassive black holes. The intense gravitational forces and magnetic fields around these black holes can accelerate particles to high energies, which then escape into the intergalactic medium as cosmic rays.\n\n3. Gamma-ray bursts: These are extremely energetic explosions that occur in distant galaxies, possibly due to the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. Gamma-ray bursts can also accelerate particles to high energies, contributing to the cosmic ray flux.\n\n4. Other sources: There are other potential sources of cosmic rays, such as pulsars, quasars, and even exotic phenomena like dark matter annihilation. However, the contribution of these sources to the overall cosmic ray flux is still uncertain and under investigation.\n\nAs cosmic rays travel through the Solar System, they interact with the magnetic and electric fields present in the interplanetary medium. The Sun's magnetic field, also known as the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), plays a crucial role in shaping the trajectories of cosmic rays. Due to their charged nature, cosmic rays are deflected by the IMF, causing them to follow helical paths around the magnetic field lines.\n\nAdditionally, the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, carries the IMF throughout the Solar System. This causes the cosmic rays to experience a \"drift\" motion, which depends on their charge and energy. Lower-energy cosmic rays are more strongly affected by the solar wind and IMF, leading to a modulation in the cosmic ray intensity observed near Earth.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays originate from various astrophysical sources, with supernova remnants being the most significant contributor. As they travel through the Solar System, cosmic rays interact with the magnetic and electric fields present, causing their trajectories to be influenced by the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind."
