    "message_2": "The largest known structure in the cosmic web is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall (Her-CrB GW). This massive structure is a galactic filament composed of galaxy clusters and spans approximately 10 billion light-years across. It was discovered in 2013 and is considered the largest known structure in the observable universe.\n\nThe size of the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall affects the distribution of galaxies within it by creating a higher density of galaxies in the regions where the filament is located. The cosmic web is a vast network of interconnected filaments and voids, with filaments containing the majority of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The immense size of the Her-CrB GW means that it contains a significant number of galaxies and galaxy clusters, which are distributed along its length.\n\nThe presence of such a large structure can also influence the formation and evolution of galaxies within it. The gravitational forces within the filament can cause galaxies to merge or interact with one another, leading to the formation of larger galaxies or triggering star formation. Additionally, the large-scale distribution of dark matter within the filament can affect the overall distribution of galaxies and their properties.\n\nIn summary, the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, as the largest known structure in the cosmic web, plays a significant role in the distribution of galaxies within it and can influence their formation and evolution."
