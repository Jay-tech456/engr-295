    "message_2": "To calculate the stopping power of a 2 MeV alpha particle in air, we can use the Bethe-Bloch formula. The stopping power (S) is defined as the energy loss per unit path length of the particle in the medium. The Bethe-Bloch formula is given by:\n\nS = (4πe⁴z²N)/(m_ev²) * (ln(2m_ev²γ²β²/I) - β²)\n\nwhere:\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- z is the charge of the incident particle (for an alpha particle, z = 2)\n- N is the number density of atoms in the medium (for air, N ≈ 2.5 x 10^(25) m^(-3))\n- m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\n- v is the velocity of the incident particle\n- γ is the Lorentz factor (γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²))\n- β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light (β = v/c)\n- I is the mean excitation energy of the medium (for air, I ≈ 85.7 eV)\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity (v) of the alpha particle. We can do this by using the kinetic energy formula:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv²\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy (2 MeV = 2 x 10^6 eV = 3.204 x 10^(-13) J) and m is the mass of the alpha particle (6.644 x 10^(-27) kg).\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * KE / m) = sqrt(2 * 3.204 x 10^(-13) J / 6.644 x 10^(-27) kg) ≈ 1.45 x 10^7 m/s\n\nNow we can calculate β:\n\nβ = v/c = 1.45 x 10^7 m/s / 3 x 10^8 m/s ≈ 0.0483\n\nNext, we find the Lorentz factor γ:\n\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.0483²) ≈ 1.0012\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the Bethe-Bloch formula:\n\nS = (4π(1.602 x 10^(-19) C)⁴(2)²(2.5 x 10^(25) m^(-3)))/(9.109 x 10^(-31) kg * (1.45 x 10^7 m/s)²) * (ln(2(9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)(1.45 x 10^7 m/s)²(1.0012)²(0.0483)²/(85.7 eV)) - 0.0483²)\n\nS ≈ 1.61 x 10^(-15) J/m\n\nThe stopping power of a 2 MeV alpha particle in air is approximately 1.61 x 10^(-15) J/m."
