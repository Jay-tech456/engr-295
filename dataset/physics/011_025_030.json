    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal conductivity of the nanowire, we can use the formula for heat transfer through a cylindrical object:\n\nQ = (2 * π * k * L * ΔT) / ln(R2/R1)\n\nWhere:\nQ = heat transfer rate (W)\nk = thermal conductivity of the material (W/m-K)\nL = length of the nanowire (m)\nΔT = temperature difference between the two ends (K)\nR1 = inner radius of the nanowire (m)\nR2 = outer radius of the nanowire (m)\n\nWe are given:\nk = 5 W/m-K\nL = 100 nm = 100 * 10^(-9) m\nR1 = 0 (since it's a solid wire)\nR2 = 10 nm = 10 * 10^(-9) m\nΔT = 310 K - 290 K = 20 K\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (2 * π * 5 * 100 * 10^(-9) * 20) / ln(10 * 10^(-9) / 0)\n\nHowever, we cannot divide by zero in the denominator. Since the nanowire is a solid wire, we can assume that the heat transfer is taking place through the entire cross-sectional area of the wire. In this case, we can use the formula for heat transfer through a solid cylinder:\n\nQ = k * A * ΔT / L\n\nWhere:\nA = cross-sectional area of the nanowire (m^2)\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the nanowire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * R2^2\n\nA = π * (10 * 10^(-9))^2\nA = π * 10^(-16) m^2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for heat transfer through a solid cylinder:\n\nQ = 5 * π * 10^(-16) * 20 / (100 * 10^(-9))\n\nQ = 100 * π * 10^(-16) W\n\nNow, we can find the thermal conductivity (k') of the nanowire at 300 K by rearranging the formula for heat transfer through a solid cylinder:\n\nk' = (Q * L) / (A * ΔT)\n\nk' = (100 * π * 10^(-16) * 100 * 10^(-9)) / (π * 10^(-16) * 20)\n\nk' = 5 W/m-K\n\nThe thermal conductivity of the nanowire at 300 K is the same as the given thermal conductivity of the material, which is 5 W/m-K."
