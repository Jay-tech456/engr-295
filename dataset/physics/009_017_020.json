    "message_2": "To find the angle of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction minima:\n\nmλ = a * sin(θ)\n\nwhere m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, a is the width of the slit, and θ is the angle of the minimum.\n\nGiven:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nFor the first minimum (m = 1):\n\n1 * (600 * 10^(-9) m) = (0.2 * 10^(-3) m) * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * (600 * 10^(-9) m)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\nsin(θ) = 0.003\n\nθ = arcsin(0.003) ≈ 0.171°\n\nThe angle of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.171°.\n\nTo find the angle of the first maximum, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction maxima:\n\n(m + 1/2)λ = a * sin(θ)\n\nFor the first maximum (m = 0):\n\n(0 + 1/2) * (600 * 10^(-9) m) = (0.2 * 10^(-3) m) * sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for θ:\n\nsin(θ) = (1/2 * (600 * 10^(-9) m)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3) m)\nsin(θ) = 0.0015\n\nθ = arcsin(0.0015) ≈ 0.086°\n\nThe angle of the first maximum in the diffraction pattern is approximately 0.086°."
