    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, we can use the following formula:\n\nK.E. = (γ - 1) * m * c^2\n\nwhere K.E. is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor (γ), which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. In this case, v = 0.6c.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nK.E. = (1.25 - 1) * 1 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2\nK.E. = 0.25 * 1 kg * (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK.E. = 2.25 * 10^16 J\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is approximately 2.25 * 10^16 joules."
