    "message_2": "In general relativity, a black hole is described by the Schwarzschild solution, which is a spherically symmetric, non-rotating black hole. The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. The radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe mass of the black hole is entirely contained within the event horizon. Therefore, the maximum amount of matter that can be contained within the event horizon of a black hole of a given mass is simply the mass of the black hole itself, M.\n\nIt is important to note that black holes can also have angular momentum (rotation) and charge, which would be described by the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr√∂m solutions, respectively. However, the basic idea remains the same: the maximum amount of matter contained within the event horizon is equal to the mass of the black hole."
