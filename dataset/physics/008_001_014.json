    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The mass of the Higgs boson is approximately 125.1 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), which is equivalent to about 2.24 x 10^-25 kg.\n\nThe Higgs boson plays a crucial role in the Standard Model as it is responsible for the Higgs mechanism, which gives mass to other particles. It couples to other particles through a process called the Yukawa coupling. The strength of the coupling is proportional to the mass of the particle it is interacting with. This means that heavier particles, such as the top quark, have a stronger coupling to the Higgs boson than lighter particles, like electrons.\n\nIn summary, the Higgs boson has a mass of approximately 125.1 GeV/c² and couples to other particles in the Standard Model through the Yukawa coupling, with the strength of the coupling being proportional to the mass of the interacting particle."
