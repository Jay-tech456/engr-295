    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop and then sum up the contributions from all the loops.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field B due to a single circular loop at a point on its axis is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point on the axis.\n\nIn our case, we have a coil with 10 turns, so we need to multiply the magnetic field due to a single loop by the number of turns (N = 10).\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n- Radius of the wire: 2 mm = 0.002 m\n- Distance from the center of the coil: 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB_single_loop = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * (0.002 m)²) / (2 * ((0.002 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB_single_loop ≈ 9.6 × 10^(-8) T\n\nNow, we multiply the magnetic field due to a single loop by the number of turns:\n\nB_total = 10 * B_single_loop ≈ 10 * 9.6 × 10^(-8) T ≈ 9.6 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the coil, 5 cm away from the center of the coil, is approximately 9.6 × 10^(-7) T."
