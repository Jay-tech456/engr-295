    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton.\n\nThe work-energy theorem states that the work done on the proton is equal to its change in kinetic energy. In a linear accelerator, the work done on the proton is given by:\n\nW = qV\n\nwhere q is the charge of the proton and V is the accelerating voltage.\n\nSince the work done on the proton is equal to its change in kinetic energy, we have:\n\nK = qV\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity of the proton at the end of the accelerator. The work done on the proton is also equal to the relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nqV = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nWe know the mass of the proton (m = 1.67 × 10^-27 kg), the charge of the proton (q = 1.6 × 10^-19 C), the speed of light (c = 3 × 10^8 m/s), and the accelerating voltage (V = 10 MV = 10 × 10^6 V). We need to find the Lorentz factor γ.\n\nFirst, let's solve for γ in terms of qV and mc^2:\n\nγ = (qV/mc^2) + 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nγ = ((1.6 × 10^-19 C)(10 × 10^6 V)) / ((1.67 × 10^-27 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2) + 1\nγ ≈ 6.37\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the maximum kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (6.37 - 1)(1.67 × 10^-27 kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 2.69 × 10^-10 J\n\nSo, the maximum kinetic energy that can be attained by a proton in this linear accelerator is approximately 2.69 × 10^-10 Joules."
