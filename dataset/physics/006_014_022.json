    "message_1": "What is the formula for calculating the lifetime of an excited state in an atom, given its decay rate and the probability of decay for that state? Use the formula to determine the lifetime of the n=2 excited state in a hydrogen atom, which has a decay rate of 6.3 x 10^8 s^-1 and a probability of decay of 0.5.",
    "message_2": "The lifetime (τ) of an excited state in an atom can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nτ = 1 / (decay rate × probability of decay)\n\nGiven the decay rate (Γ) of 6.3 x 10^8 s^-1 and the probability of decay (P) of 0.5 for the n=2 excited state in a hydrogen atom, we can calculate the lifetime as follows:\n\nτ = 1 / (6.3 x 10^8 s^-1 × 0.5)\n\nτ = 1 / (3.15 x 10^8 s^-1)\n\nτ ≈ 3.17 x 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the n=2 excited state in a hydrogen atom is approximately 3.17 x 10^-9 seconds."
