    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.02 m from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (circumferential direction), and its magnitude is constant at a given radial distance (r) from the center of the cable. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the magnetic field at a point 0.02 m from the center of the cable. Since this point is inside the inner conductor (r < 0.03 m), the enclosed current is the current density (J) times the area enclosed by the loop.\n\nFirst, let's find the current density (J). The total current (I) is 5.0 A, and it is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of the inner conductor (A_inner). The area of the inner conductor can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA_inner = π(R_inner)^2\nA_inner = π(0.03 m)^2\nA_inner ≈ 0.002827 m²\n\nNow, we can find the current density (J):\n\nJ = I / A_inner\nJ ≈ 5.0 A / 0.002827 m²\nJ ≈ 1769.4 A/m²\n\nNext, we need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) at a radial distance of 0.02 m. The enclosed area (A_enclosed) is:\n\nA_enclosed = π(r)^2\nA_enclosed = π(0.02 m)^2\nA_enclosed ≈ 0.001257 m²\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current (I_enclosed):\n\nI_enclosed = J * A_enclosed\nI_enclosed ≈ 1769.4 A/m² * 0.001257 m²\nI_enclosed ≈ 2.223 A\n\nFinally, we can find the magnetic field (B) at a radial distance of 0.02 m using Ampere's Law:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = [(4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 2.223 A] / (2π * 0.02 m)\nB ≈ 1.1145 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point 0.02 m from the center of the cable is approximately 1.1145 × 10^(-5) T."
