    "message_2": "The critical angle of incidence (θc) can be found using Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the critical angle (θc) at which the light ray will undergo total internal reflection when traveling from water to diamond. At the critical angle, the angle of refraction (θ2) will be 90 degrees.\n\nGiven the refractive indices of water (n1 = 1.33) and diamond (n2 = 2.42), we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\n1.33 * sin(θc) = 2.42 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n1.33 * sin(θc) = 2.42\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θc):\n\nsin(θc) = 2.42 / 1.33\nsin(θc) ≈ 1.821\n\nHowever, the sine function cannot have a value greater than 1, which means that total internal reflection is not possible in this case. Light will always be transmitted from water to diamond, regardless of the angle of incidence."
