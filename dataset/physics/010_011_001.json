    "message_1": "A cylindrical vessel is filled with water and rotated steadily around a vertical axis. If the radius of the vessel is 0.1 m and the rotational speed is 100 rpm, determine the critical speed above which the water in the vessel will start to form vortexes. (Assume the water behaves as an ideal fluid and neglect the effect of surface tension.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the critical speed above which the water in the vessel will start to form vortexes, we can use the concept of centrifugal force and gravitational force acting on the water.\n\nWhen the water starts to form a vortex, the centrifugal force acting on the water at the edge of the vessel will be equal to the gravitational force acting on the water. We can write this as:\n\nFc = Fg\n\nwhere Fc is the centrifugal force and Fg is the gravitational force.\n\nThe centrifugal force acting on the water can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nFc = m * ω^2 * r\n\nwhere m is the mass of the water, ω is the angular velocity in rad/s, and r is the radius of the vessel.\n\nThe gravitational force acting on the water can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nFg = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the water and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nNow, we can equate the two forces:\n\nm * ω^2 * r = m * g\n\nSince we are interested in finding the critical angular velocity (ω), we can cancel out the mass (m) from both sides and rearrange the equation:\n\nω^2 = g / r\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for g and r:\n\nω^2 = 9.81 m/s² / 0.1 m\n\nω^2 = 98.1 s^(-2)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nω = sqrt(98.1 s^(-2)) = 9.9 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to convert the angular velocity from rad/s to rpm (revolutions per minute):\n\nω (rpm) = ω (rad/s) * (60 s/min) / (2π rad/rev)\n\nω (rpm) = 9.9 rad/s * (60 s/min) / (2π rad/rev)\n\nω (rpm) ≈ 94.5 rpm\n\nTherefore, the critical speed above which the water in the vessel will start to form vortexes is approximately 94.5 rpm."
