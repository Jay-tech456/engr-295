    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and stability of galaxies of different sizes. It is a mysterious form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. Dark matter is estimated to make up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content.\n\nThe impact of dark matter on the formation and stability of galaxies can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to pull together the initial gas clouds that eventually form galaxies. Without dark matter, the gravitational pull from the visible matter alone might not be strong enough to initiate galaxy formation.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold the galaxies together. This extra mass helps maintain the stability of galaxies by preventing them from flying apart due to their high rotational speeds.\n\n3. Large-scale structure: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters. These structures are formed due to the gravitational attraction of dark matter, which acts as a cosmic scaffold for the visible matter to clump together.\n\n4. Dwarf galaxies: Dark matter is particularly important for the stability of small galaxies, such as dwarf galaxies. These galaxies have a higher dark matter to visible matter ratio compared to larger galaxies. The presence of dark matter helps to maintain their stability and prevents them from being disrupted by the tidal forces of neighboring galaxies.\n\n5. Galaxy mergers: Dark matter also plays a role in the merging of galaxies, which is a common process in the universe. During a merger, the dark matter halos of the colliding galaxies interact with each other, influencing the dynamics and final structure of the resulting galaxy.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter has a significant impact on the formation and stability of galaxies of different sizes. Its gravitational influence is essential for initiating galaxy formation, maintaining the stability of galaxies, and shaping the large-scale structure of the universe."
