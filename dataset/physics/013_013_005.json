    "message_2": "The maximum mass that a neutron star can attain before collapsing into a black hole is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit depends on the equation of state of the neutron star's matter, which describes how the pressure of the matter depends on its density. The exact equation of state for neutron star matter is still a topic of ongoing research in nuclear physics and astrophysics.\n\nHowever, based on current understanding and observations, the maximum mass of a neutron star is estimated to be around 2 to 2.5 solar masses (where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun, approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg). If a neutron star exceeds this mass, it will collapse under its own gravity and form a black hole. It is important to note that this value is an approximation and may be refined as our understanding of neutron star matter and equations of state improves."
