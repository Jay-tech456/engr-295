    "message_2": "To calculate the change in the black hole's mass and angular momentum due to the interaction with the star, we need to consider the energy and angular momentum transferred from the star to the black hole during the encounter. This is a complex problem that depends on several factors, such as the masses of the black hole and the star, their initial velocities, and the distance of closest approach.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the star passes close enough to the black hole that a significant fraction of its mass is transferred to the black hole via tidal forces. We can use the following variables:\n\nM_bh: mass of the black hole\nM_star: mass of the star\nR_bh: Schwarzschild radius of the black hole\nR_star: radius of the star\nd: distance of closest approach between the black hole and the star\nG: gravitational constant\n\nFirst, let's calculate the tidal force acting on the star:\n\nF_tidal = (G * M_bh * M_star) / d^2\n\nNow, let's assume that a fraction f of the star's mass is transferred to the black hole. The change in the black hole's mass is then:\n\nΔM = f * M_star\n\nThe angular momentum of the star can be approximated as:\n\nL_star = I_star * ω_star\n\nwhere I_star is the moment of inertia of the star and ω_star is its angular velocity. Assuming the star is a uniform sphere, its moment of inertia is:\n\nI_star = (2/5) * M_star * R_star^2\n\nNow, let's assume that a fraction g of the star's angular momentum is transferred to the black hole. The change in the black hole's angular momentum is then:\n\nΔL = g * L_star\n\nTo find the exact values of f and g, we would need to perform a detailed numerical simulation of the encounter, taking into account the complex dynamics of the system. However, the above equations provide a general framework for understanding how the mass and angular momentum of the black hole can change due to the interaction with a passing star."
