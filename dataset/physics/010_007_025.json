    "message_2": "To find the fraction of the block's volume that is submerged in water, we can use the principle of buoyancy. When an object is floating, the buoyant force acting on it is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nThe buoyant force (F_b) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_b = V_submerged * ρ_water * g\n\nwhere V_submerged is the volume of the submerged part of the block, ρ_water is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nThe weight of the block (W_block) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW_block = V_block * ρ_block * g\n\nwhere V_block is the volume of the block and ρ_block is the density of the block (800 kg/m³).\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the block:\n\nV_block = 0.5 m * 0.3 m * 0.2 m = 0.03 m³\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the block:\n\nW_block = V_block * ρ_block * g = 0.03 m³ * 800 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 235.44 N\n\nSince the block is floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the block:\n\nF_b = W_block = 235.44 N\n\nNow, we can solve for the volume of the submerged part of the block:\n\nV_submerged = F_b / (ρ_water * g) = 235.44 N / (1000 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s²) ≈ 0.024 m³\n\nFinally, we can find the fraction of the block's volume that is submerged in water:\n\nFraction_submerged = V_submerged / V_block = 0.024 m³ / 0.03 m³ ≈ 0.8\n\nSo, approximately 80% of the block's volume is submerged in water."
