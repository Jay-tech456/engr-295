    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, we can find the magnetic field due to each side and then sum them up to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nConsider one side of the square loop. Let's say we are looking at the bottom side, with current flowing from left to right. The position vector r for the center of the loop is at a distance a/2 from the middle of the side, perpendicular to the current. The magnetic field dB due to a small current element dl on this side can be found using the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nSince the current is flowing horizontally and r is vertical, the cross product dl x r will be in the direction perpendicular to both (out of the plane). The magnitude of the cross product is given by:\n\n|dl x r| = dl * r * sin(90°) = dl * r\n\nThe angle between dl and r is 90°, so sin(90°) = 1. Thus, the magnetic field dB due to this small current element is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire side, we get:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dl * r) / r³ = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * (a / (a/2)²) = (μ₀ * I * 2) / (4 * a)\n\nSince the square loop has four sides, the total magnetic field at the center is:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side = 4 * (μ₀ * I * 2) / (4 * a) = (μ₀ * I) / a\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / a"
