    "message_1": "A container with a volume of 0.5 m³ initially contains 0.05 kg of air at a pressure of 1.2 bar and a temperature of 27°C. If an additional 0.1 kg of air is pumped into the container and the temperature is raised to 37°C, what is the final internal energy of the system in Joules?",
    "message_2": "To find the final internal energy of the system, we first need to determine the final pressure and the specific heat capacity of air at constant volume (Cv).\n\n1. Convert the given temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K\nT2 = 37°C + 273.15 = 310.15 K\n\n2. The total mass of air in the container after pumping in additional air:\nm_total = 0.05 kg + 0.1 kg = 0.15 kg\n\n3. The specific heat capacity of air at constant volume (Cv) is approximately 717 J/(kg·K) for diatomic gases like air.\n\n4. The ideal gas law can be used to find the final pressure (P2) after the additional air is pumped in and the temperature is raised:\nP1 * V = m1 * R * T1\nP2 * V = m_total * R * T2\n\nWhere P1 is the initial pressure, V is the volume, m1 is the initial mass of air, R is the specific gas constant for air (approximately 287 J/(kg·K)), and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.\n\n1.2 bar * 100,000 Pa/bar * 0.5 m³ = 0.05 kg * 287 J/(kg·K) * 300.15 K\nP2 * 0.5 m³ = 0.15 kg * 287 J/(kg·K) * 310.15 K\n\nSolve for P2:\nP2 = (0.15 kg * 287 J/(kg·K) * 310.15 K) / (0.5 m³) = 263,738.675 Pa\n\n5. Now we can find the change in internal energy (ΔU) using the formula:\nΔU = m_total * Cv * (T2 - T1)\n\nΔU = 0.15 kg * 717 J/(kg·K) * (310.15 K - 300.15 K)\nΔU = 0.15 kg * 717 J/(kg·K) * 10 K\nΔU = 1075.5 J\n\nThe final internal energy of the system is 1075.5 Joules."
