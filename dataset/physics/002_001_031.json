    "message_2": "To calculate the work done during an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere:\nW is the work done,\nn is the number of moles of the gas,\nR is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)),\nT is the constant temperature in Kelvin,\nVf is the final volume, and\nVi is the initial volume.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nn = 1 mole,\nT = 273 K,\nVi = 10 L, and\nVf = 20 L.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume from liters to cubic meters (m³) since the gas constant R is in J/(mol·K). There are 1000 L in 1 m³, so:\n\nVi = 10 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.01 m³\nVf = 20 L * (1 m³ / 1000 L) = 0.02 m³\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nW = (1 mol) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (273 K) * ln(0.02 m³ / 0.01 m³)\n\nW = (1 mol) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (273 K) * ln(2)\n\nW ≈ 22.4 J\n\nSo, the work done when 1 mole of an ideal gas expands isothermally at a constant temperature of 273 K, from a volume of 10 L to 20 L, is approximately 22.4 Joules."
