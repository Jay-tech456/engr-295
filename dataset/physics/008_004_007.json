    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I cannot provide real-time data. However, as of my last update in September 2021, the most recent measurement of the top quark mass at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN was approximately 172.76 GeV/c², with an uncertainty of about 0.30 GeV/c². This value was obtained by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC.\n\nThis measurement is consistent with previous measurements and theoretical predictions. The top quark mass has been measured by various experiments, including the Tevatron at Fermilab, which reported a value of around 173.34 GeV/c² with an uncertainty of about 0.76 GeV/c². The precision of the LHC measurements has been continuously improving, and the uncertainties have been decreasing over time.\n\nIt is important to note that the top quark mass is a crucial parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics, and its precise determination is essential for testing the model's consistency and making predictions for other phenomena, such as the stability of the Higgs boson and the behavior of particles at high energies."
