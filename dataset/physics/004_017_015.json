    "message_2": "To calculate the deflection angle of a light ray passing near a massive object, we can use the formula derived from general relativity:\n\nDeflection angle (α) = (4 * G * M) / (r * c^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the object, r is the closest distance of the light ray from the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the mass M = 10^23 kg, the closest distance r = 10^9 meters, and the speed of light c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nα = (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 10^23 kg) / (10^9 m * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nα = (26.696 x 10^12) / (10^9 * 9 x 10^16)\n\nα = (26.696 x 10^12) / (9 x 10^25)\n\nα = 2.9662 x 10^-13 radians\n\nTo convert the deflection angle to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds:\n\nα = 2.9662 x 10^-13 radians * 206265 arcseconds/radian\n\nα ≈ 6.12 x 10^-8 arcseconds\n\nThe magnitude of the deflection angle of the light ray passing near the massive object is approximately 6.12 x 10^-8 arcseconds."
