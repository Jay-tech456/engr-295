    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located 6 cm from the center of the coil along its axis, we can use the formula for the axial magnetic field of a solenoid:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nR = 0.1 m (converted from 10 cm)\nN = 500 turns\nI = 2.5 A\nx = 0.06 m (converted from 6 cm)\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 * 2.5 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.06 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 9.96 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point located 6 cm from the center of the coil along its axis is approximately 9.96 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
