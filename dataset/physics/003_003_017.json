    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a toroidal solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). Since the toroid has 200 turns wound uniformly on a circular core of radius 6 cm, we can calculate the circumference of the core:\n\nC = 2πr\nC = 2π(0.06 m)\nC = 0.377 m\n\nNow we can find the number of turns per unit length:\n\nn = total number of turns / circumference\nn = 200 turns / 0.377 m\nn ≈ 530.5 turns/m\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field inside the toroidal solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (530.5 turns/m) * (5 A)\nB ≈ 4.19 × 10⁻³ T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic field inside the toroidal solenoid. The point we are interested in is on the axis of the toroid, 4 cm away from the center. In this case, the magnetic field at that point will be different.\n\nTo find the magnetic field at that point, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of current:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the toroid, and x is the distance from the center of the toroid.\n\nIn our case, R = 0.06 m and x = 0.04 m. We also need to consider that there are 200 turns, so the magnetic field will be 200 times the magnetic field due to a single loop.\n\nB_total = 200 * (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\nB_total = 200 * ((4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (5 A) * (0.06 m)²) / (2 * ((0.06 m)² + (0.04 m)²)^(3/2))\nB_total ≈ 1.34 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid having a distance of 4 cm from the center of the toroid is approximately 1.34 × 10⁻³ T."
