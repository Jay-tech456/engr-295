    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects gravitational lensing by contributing to the overall mass distribution in the universe. Gravitational lensing occurs when light from a distant object, such as a galaxy or a star, is bent by the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster or another galaxy, that lies between the observer and the distant object. This bending of light causes the distant object to appear distorted, magnified, or multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, makes up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. Although it cannot be directly observed, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light. Since dark matter contributes to the overall mass distribution, it also contributes to the gravitational lensing effect.\n\nTo distinguish gravitational lensing caused by dark matter from that caused by visible matter, astronomers look for specific observable features:\n\n1. Mass distribution: The distribution of mass in a lensing system can be inferred from the observed lensing effect. If the mass distribution inferred from lensing does not match the distribution of visible matter, it suggests the presence of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation curves of galaxies can provide information about the distribution of mass within the galaxy. If the observed rotation curve cannot be explained by the visible matter alone, it implies the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Weak lensing: Weak gravitational lensing is a subtle distortion of the shapes of background galaxies caused by the presence of a massive foreground object. By analyzing the weak lensing signal from a large number of galaxies, astronomers can map the distribution of mass, including dark matter, in the foreground object.\n\n4. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its photons have traveled through the universe for billions of years. As these photons pass through massive structures, they are gravitationally lensed. By analyzing the lensing effect on the CMB, astronomers can probe the distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter affects gravitational lensing by contributing to the overall mass distribution, which in turn influences the bending of light. Observable features such as mass distribution, galaxy rotation curves, weak lensing, and CMB lensing can be used to distinguish gravitational lensing caused by dark matter from that caused by visible matter."
