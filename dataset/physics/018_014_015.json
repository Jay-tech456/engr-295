    "message_2": "To find the frequency and wavelength of the gravitational wave, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f) = 1 / Period (T)\n2. Wavelength (λ) = Speed of light (c) / Frequency (f)\n\nGiven the period (T) of the gravitational wave is 5 milliseconds (0.005 seconds), we can find the frequency (f) using the first formula:\n\nf = 1 / T\nf = 1 / 0.005 s\nf ≈ 200 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can find the wavelength (λ) using the second formula. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second (m/s):\n\nλ = c / f\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / 200 Hz\nλ ≈ 1.5 x 10^6 meters\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational wave is approximately 200 Hz, and its wavelength is approximately 1.5 x 10^6 meters."
