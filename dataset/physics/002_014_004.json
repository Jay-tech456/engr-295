    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) to the work input (W). In a Carnot cycle, the efficiency of a refrigerator is given by:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nWe can also relate the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) and the heat rejected to the hot reservoir (Q_h) to the temperatures of the reservoirs:\n\nQ_c / Q_h = T_c / T_h\n\nWhere T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir (273 K) and T_h is the temperature of the hot reservoir (300 K).\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find Q_c:\n\nQ_c = Q_h * (T_c / T_h)\n\nIn a refrigerator, the work input (W) is used to transfer heat from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir. Therefore, the heat rejected to the hot reservoir (Q_h) is the sum of the heat removed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) and the work input (W):\n\nQ_h = Q_c + W\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for Q_c from the previous equation:\n\nQ_h = Q_h * (T_c / T_h) + W\n\nWe can solve for Q_h:\n\nQ_h * (1 - T_c / T_h) = W\n\nQ_h = W / (1 - T_c / T_h)\n\nSubstitute the given values of W, T_c, and T_h:\n\nQ_h = 500 J / (1 - 273 K / 300 K)\n\nQ_h = 500 J / (1 - 0.91)\n\nQ_h = 500 J / 0.09\n\nQ_h ≈ 5555.56 J\n\nNow we can find Q_c using the expression for Q_c:\n\nQ_c = Q_h * (T_c / T_h)\n\nQ_c = 5555.56 J * (273 K / 300 K)\n\nQ_c ≈ 5055.56 J\n\nFinally, we can find the coefficient of performance (COP) using the definition:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nCOP = 5055.56 J / 500 J\n\nCOP ≈ 10.11\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the refrigerator operating on a Carnot cycle between the given temperatures is approximately 10.11."
