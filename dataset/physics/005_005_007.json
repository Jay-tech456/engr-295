    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by a clock at a distance of 50,000 km from the center of the Earth, we can use the Schwarzschild metric from general relativity. The time dilation factor is given by:\n\nΔt' / Δt = sqrt(1 - 2GM/c²R)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time interval measured by the clock at the given distance, Δt is the time interval measured by a clock far away from the Earth (at infinity), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, c is the speed of light, and R is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nThe mass of the Earth (M) is approximately 5.972 × 10^24 kg, the gravitational constant (G) is approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², and the speed of light (c) is approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from the center of the Earth from kilometers to meters:\n\n50,000 km = 50,000 × 10^3 m = 5 × 10^7 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the time dilation equation:\n\nΔt' / Δt = sqrt(1 - 2(6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)(5.972 × 10^24 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²(5 × 10^7 m))\n\nΔt' / Δt = sqrt(1 - 2(6.674 × 10^-11)(5.972 × 10^24) / (2.998 × 10^8)²(5 × 10^7))\n\nΔt' / Δt ≈ sqrt(1 - 6.955 × 10^-10)\n\nΔt' / Δt ≈ sqrt(0.9999993045)\n\nΔt' / Δt ≈ 0.99999965225\n\nThe time dilation factor is approximately 0.99999965225. This means that the clock at a distance of 50,000 km from the center of the Earth will run slower than a clock far away from the Earth (at infinity) by a factor of 0.99999965225."
