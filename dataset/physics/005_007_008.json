    "message_1": "A twin who lives on Earth experiences time differently than her twin who travels on a spaceship at a near-light speed. What is the time difference experienced by the twins after the traveling twin returns to Earth, according to Special Relativity?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time difference experienced by the twins, we need to use the concept of time dilation in Special Relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere:\n- Δt' is the time experienced by the moving twin (in the spaceship)\n- Δt is the time experienced by the stationary twin (on Earth)\n- v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nTo find the time difference, we need to know the velocity of the spaceship (v) and the time experienced by the stationary twin (Δt). Once we have these values, we can plug them into the equation and solve for Δt'.\n\nAfter finding Δt', we can calculate the time difference between the twins by subtracting the time experienced by the stationary twin (Δt) from the time experienced by the moving twin (Δt'):\n\nTime difference = Δt' - Δt\n\nWithout specific values for v and Δt, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the time difference. However, this is the general approach to solving this problem using Special Relativity."
