    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, a light source (usually a laser) is shone through two narrow slits, and the interference pattern created by the light waves passing through the slits is observed on a screen. The interference pattern consists of alternating bright and dark fringes, which are the result of constructive and destructive interference between the light waves.\n\nThe distance between the double slits (denoted as d) is one of the key factors that affect the interference pattern. To analyze the effect of changing the distance between the double slits on the interference pattern, we need to consider the following formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / d\n\nwhere:\n- θ is the angle between the central maximum (m = 0) and the m-th maximum (bright fringe)\n- m is an integer representing the order of the maximum (m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...)\n- λ is the wavelength of the light source\n- d is the distance between the double slits\n\nNow, let's analyze the interference pattern with respect to the changing distance between the double slits (d):\n\n1. As the distance between the double slits (d) increases, the angle θ for each maximum (bright fringe) decreases. This means that the bright fringes will be closer together on the screen. Conversely, as the distance between the double slits decreases, the angle θ for each maximum increases, causing the bright fringes to be further apart on the screen.\n\n2. The fringe spacing (w) on the screen can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nw = L * (λ / d)\n\nwhere:\n- L is the distance between the double slits and the screen\n\nAs the distance between the double slits (d) increases, the fringe spacing (w) decreases, meaning that the bright fringes will be closer together on the screen. Conversely, as the distance between the double slits decreases, the fringe spacing increases, causing the bright fringes to be further apart on the screen.\n\n3. The visibility or contrast of the interference pattern is also affected by the distance between the double slits. When the distance between the double slits is larger, the visibility of the interference pattern tends to be better because the light waves from the two slits have a higher degree of spatial coherence. Conversely, as the distance between the double slits decreases, the visibility of the interference pattern may be reduced due to a lower degree of spatial coherence.\n\nIn summary, changing the distance between the double slits in the double-slit experiment affects the interference pattern in the following ways:\n- The angle between the central maximum and the other maxima (bright fringes) changes.\n- The fringe spacing on the screen changes.\n- The visibility or contrast of the interference pattern may be affected."
