    "message_2": "To estimate the energy of the gamma-ray photon emitted by the blazar, we need to consider the redshift effect due to the expansion of the universe. The redshift (z) can be calculated using the Hubble's law and the distance to the blazar.\n\nHubble's law: v = H0 * d\nwhere v is the recessional velocity, H0 is the Hubble constant (approximately 70 km/s/Mpc), and d is the distance to the blazar.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from light-years to megaparsecs (Mpc):\n1 light-year = 9.461 x 10^12 km\n1 Mpc = 3.086 x 10^19 km\n3 billion light-years = 3 x 10^9 light-years * (9.461 x 10^12 km/light-year) / (3.086 x 10^19 km/Mpc) ≈ 920 Mpc\n\nNow, we can calculate the recessional velocity:\nv = H0 * d = 70 km/s/Mpc * 920 Mpc ≈ 64400 km/s\n\nNext, we can calculate the redshift (z) using the recessional velocity and the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^5 km/s):\nz = v / c = 64400 km/s / (3 x 10^5 km/s) ≈ 0.2147\n\nNow, we can estimate the energy of the gamma-ray photon when it was emitted by the blazar. The energy of the photon will be higher at the source due to the redshift effect:\nE_emitted = E_detected * (1 + z)\nE_emitted = 20 GeV * (1 + 0.2147) ≈ 24.29 GeV\n\nSo, the estimated energy of the gamma-ray photon emitted by the blazar is approximately 24.29 giga-electron volts (GeV)."
