    "message_2": "The Meissner effect is a phenomenon observed in superconductors, where the superconductor expels the magnetic field from its interior when it transitions from the normal state to the superconducting state. This expulsion of the magnetic field is due to the perfect diamagnetism exhibited by superconductors, which means they have a magnetic susceptibility of -1. The Meissner effect is one of the key features that distinguish superconductors from perfect conductors.\n\nThe underlying principles behind the Meissner effect can be explained through two main theories: the London equations and the Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n\n1. London equations: In 1935, Fritz and Heinz London proposed two equations that describe the electromagnetic properties of superconductors. The first London equation states that the electric current density (J) in a superconductor is proportional to the vector potential (A) of the magnetic field:\n\nJ = - (1/μ₀λ²) A\n\nwhere μ₀ is the vacuum permeability and λ (London penetration depth) is a characteristic length that depends on the superconductor's material properties.\n\nThe second London equation relates the magnetic field (B) to the vector potential (A):\n\n∇ × B = μ₀J\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\n∇ × (∇ × B) = - (1/λ²) B\n\nThis equation shows that the magnetic field decays exponentially within the superconductor with a characteristic length scale λ. This exponential decay of the magnetic field is the essence of the Meissner effect.\n\n2. Ginzburg-Landau theory: In 1950, Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau developed a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near their critical temperature (Tc). The Ginzburg-Landau theory introduces a complex order parameter (ψ), which represents the amplitude and phase of the superconducting electron pairs (Cooper pairs).\n\nThe Ginzburg-Landau equations relate the order parameter to the magnetic field and the supercurrent density. The theory predicts that the magnetic field penetration depth (λ) and the coherence length (ξ) determine the behavior of the superconductor. When the ratio κ = λ/ξ is greater than 1/√2, the superconductor is classified as a type-II superconductor, which allows partial penetration of the magnetic field in the form of quantized vortices (Abrikosov vortices). When κ is less than 1/√2, the superconductor is classified as a type-I superconductor, which exhibits the Meissner effect without any magnetic field penetration.\n\nIn summary, the Meissner effect occurs in superconductors due to their perfect diamagnetism, which causes the magnetic field to be expelled from the superconductor's interior. The London equations and the Ginzburg-Landau theory provide the underlying principles that describe this phenomenon."
