    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, αs, is a measure of the strength of the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. The value of αs depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, due to a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. This means that the strength of the strong force decreases as the energy scale increases.\n\nAt the energy scale of 91.2 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the Z-boson, the value of the strong coupling constant can be inferred from the measurement of the hadronic cross-section at the Z-boson peak at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. The LEP experiments have provided a precise determination of αs at this energy scale.\n\nThe value of the strong coupling constant at the Z-boson mass (91.2 GeV) is approximately αs(MZ) ≈ 0.118. This value is obtained from a combination of measurements from the LEP experiments, as well as other experiments at different energy scales. It is important to note that there is some uncertainty in this value, with the typical range being around 0.116 to 0.120."
