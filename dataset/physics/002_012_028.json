    "message_2": "To calculate the isothermal work done during the expansion of the gas, we can use the formula:\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nWhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume. \n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law for this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. We are given the initial pressure (P = 5 atm), the initial volume (Vi = 2 L), and the temperature (T = 300 K). We can rearrange the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nWe also need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa (Pascals) and the volume from L to m³, as the ideal gas constant R is given in J/(mol·K). \n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n1 L = 0.001 m³\n\nP = 5 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 506625 Pa\nVi = 2 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.002 m³\n\nNow we can calculate the number of moles:\n\nR = 8.314 J/(mol·K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nn = (506625 Pa * 0.002 m³) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K) = 0.0405 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can calculate the isothermal work done:\n\nVf = 8 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.008 m³\n\nW = -nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\nW = -0.0405 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K * ln(0.008 m³ / 0.002 m³)\nW = -1012.57 J * ln(4)\nW ≈ -1012.57 J * 1.386\nW ≈ -1403.5 J\n\nThe isothermal work done during the expansion of the gas is approximately -1403.5 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas (expansion) rather than on the gas (compression)."
