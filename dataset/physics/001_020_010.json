    "message_2": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory that describes the interactions between charged particles and photons. It is a highly successful theory, but it has a major issue: it often leads to infinite values for physical quantities such as energy and charge. These infinities are unphysical and need to be removed to make meaningful predictions. This is where the process of renormalization comes in.\n\nRenormalization is a mathematical procedure that allows us to remove these infinities and obtain finite, measurable values for physical quantities. The basic idea is to separate the infinite parts from the finite parts and absorb the infinite parts into the redefinition of physical parameters, such as mass and charge.\n\nLet's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept of renormalization. In QED, the electron self-energy is a quantity that represents the interaction of an electron with its own electromagnetic field. This self-energy is divergent, meaning it leads to an infinite value. Mathematically, the self-energy Σ(p) can be written as:\n\nΣ(p) = Σ_infinite(p) + Σ_finite(p)\n\nHere, Σ_infinite(p) represents the infinite part, and Σ_finite(p) represents the finite part. The self-energy contributes to the electron's mass and charge, so we can write the observed (renormalized) mass and charge as:\n\nm_renormalized = m_bare + δm\ne_renormalized = e_bare + δe\n\nwhere m_bare and e_bare are the bare (unrenormalized) mass and charge, and δm and δe are the mass and charge counterterms that absorb the infinite parts of the self-energy.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the self-energy in terms of the renormalized mass and charge:\n\nΣ(p) = Σ_infinite(m_renormalized, e_renormalized) + Σ_finite(m_renormalized, e_renormalized)\n\nThe key step in renormalization is to choose the counterterms δm and δe such that the infinite parts of the self-energy are canceled out:\n\nΣ_infinite(m_renormalized, e_renormalized) = -δm - δe\n\nThis leaves us with a finite self-energy that can be used to make physical predictions:\n\nΣ(p) = Σ_finite(m_renormalized, e_renormalized)\n\nIn summary, renormalization is a mathematical procedure that allows us to remove the infinities that arise in quantum field theories like QED. By separating the infinite and finite parts of divergent quantities and absorbing the infinite parts into the redefinition of physical parameters, we can obtain finite values for physical quantities and make meaningful predictions."
