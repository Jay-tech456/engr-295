    "message_2": "The gravitational effects of a black hole on a nearby planet's orbit can be understood using Newton's law of universal gravitation and general relativity. According to Newton's law, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In the context of a black hole and a nearby planet, the gravitational force would depend on the mass of the black hole and the distance between the black hole and the planet.\n\nNow, if we consider a star with the same mass as the black hole, the gravitational force acting on the nearby planet would be the same, as long as the distance between the planet and the center of mass of the star is the same as the distance between the planet and the black hole. This is because, according to the law of universal gravitation, the force depends only on the mass and distance, not on the size or nature of the objects.\n\nHowever, there are some differences in the effects of a black hole and a star with the same mass on a nearby planet's orbit due to general relativity. A black hole is an extremely compact object with a very strong gravitational field, which causes spacetime to curve more intensely around it compared to a star with the same mass. This can lead to some relativistic effects, such as gravitational time dilation and gravitational redshift, which would be more pronounced near a black hole than near a star of the same mass.\n\nIn terms of the planet's orbit, if the planet is far enough from both the black hole and the star, its orbit would be very similar in both cases, as the dominant factor determining the orbit is the mass of the central object. However, if the planet is very close to the event horizon of the black hole, it would experience extreme tidal forces and relativistic effects that would not be present near a star with the same mass. These effects could potentially cause the planet's orbit to be unstable or even result in the planet being torn apart by tidal forces.\n\nIn summary, the gravitational effects of a black hole and a star with the same mass on a nearby planet's orbit are similar in terms of the overall gravitational force, but there are differences in the relativistic effects and tidal forces experienced by the planet, especially if it is very close to the black hole."
