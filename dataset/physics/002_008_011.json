    "message_1": "A physics student wants to determine the specific heat capacity of a metal block. She decides to perform an experiment by heating the block in boiling water and then transferring it to a calorimeter containing cold water. The initial temperature of the cold water is 25 degrees Celsius, the final temperature of the mixture after the transfer is 35 degrees Celsius, and the mass of the metal block is 500 grams. If the mass of the water in the calorimeter is 1000 grams, what is the specific heat capacity of the metal?",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific heat capacity of the metal block, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat gained by the water in the calorimeter is equal to the heat lost by the metal block.\n\nLet's denote the specific heat capacity of the metal as c_m and the specific heat capacity of water as c_w (which is 4.18 J/g°C). The initial temperature of the metal block is 100°C (boiling water temperature), and the final temperature is 35°C.\n\nHeat gained by water (Q_w) = mass of water (m_w) × specific heat capacity of water (c_w) × change in temperature of water (ΔT_w)\nHeat lost by metal (Q_m) = mass of metal (m_m) × specific heat capacity of metal (c_m) × change in temperature of metal (ΔT_m)\n\nSince Q_w = Q_m, we can set up the following equation:\n\nm_w × c_w × ΔT_w = m_m × c_m × ΔT_m\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(1000 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (35°C - 25°C) = (500 g) × c_m × (100°C - 35°C)\n\nSolve for c_m:\n\n(1000 g) × (4.18 J/g°C) × (10°C) = (500 g) × c_m × (65°C)\n\n41800 J = 32500 g × c_m\n\nc_m = 41800 J / 32500 g\nc_m ≈ 1.286 J/g°C\n\nSo, the specific heat capacity of the metal block is approximately 1.286 J/g°C."
