    "message_1": "A certain DC motor carries a current of 10 A through a wire of length 20 cm. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the wire, assuming that the current flows perpendicular to the plane containing the wire and the point.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point near a current-carrying wire, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, for a straight wire, we can use Ampere's law, which simplifies the calculation. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a straight wire carrying current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nIn this case, the current (I) is 10 A, and the distance (r) from the wire is 5 cm or 0.05 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T) / 0.1\n\nB = 4 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 5 cm from the wire is 4 × 10^(-5) Tesla.\n\nTo determine the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (perpendicular to the plane containing the wire and the point), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be circulating around the wire in a clockwise direction when looking at the wire from the point 5 cm away."
