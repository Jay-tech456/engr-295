    "message_2": "The current best estimate for the value of the cosmological constant (Î›) is approximately 1.105 x 10^-52 m^(-2). This value is derived from various observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nThe cosmological constant is associated with the energy density of dark energy, which is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is believed to be responsible for the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. Dark energy counteracts the attractive force of gravity, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time.\n\nThe exact nature of dark energy is still not well understood, but the cosmological constant is one way to describe its effects on the universe. In the context of Einstein's general theory of relativity, the cosmological constant is introduced as a term in the field equations, representing a constant energy density that is uniformly distributed throughout space. This constant energy density acts as a repulsive force, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate."
