    "message_1": "A toroid carries a current of 5 amps and has 2000 turns. The toroid has a mean radius of 10 cm and a cross-sectional area of 5 sq cm. Calculate the magnetic field inside and outside the toroid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the toroid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I). For a toroid, the formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the mean radius of the toroid.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\nN = 2000 turns\nI = 5 A\nr = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2000 * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) * 10000) / 0.2\n\nB_inside = (4 * 10^(-3) T) / 0.2\n\nB_inside ≈ 20 mT (milliTesla)\n\nNow, for the magnetic field outside the toroid, the magnetic field lines are confined within the toroid's core, and they do not extend outside. Therefore, the magnetic field outside the toroid is:\n\nB_outside = 0 T"
