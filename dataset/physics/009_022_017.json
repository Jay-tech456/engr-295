    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that when unpolarized light is incident on a surface at a specific angle, the reflected light will be completely polarized. This specific angle is called the Brewster's angle (θ_B). The Brewster's angle can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nθ_B = arctan(n2/n1)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (usually air, with a refractive index of approximately 1) and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (in this case, glass).\n\nThe refractive index of glass varies depending on the type of glass, but it typically ranges from 1.5 to 1.6. Assuming a refractive index of 1.5 for the glass, we can calculate the Brewster's angle:\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.5/1) = arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.3°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence of unpolarized light on a glass surface that results in a completely polarized reflected light is approximately 56.3°."
