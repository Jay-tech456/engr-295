    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the gas during an isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nHowever, we are not given the number of moles or the temperature. We can use the first law of thermodynamics to relate the heat absorbed (Q) to the work done (W) and the change in internal energy (∆U):\n\nQ = ∆U + W\n\nFor an isothermal process, the change in internal energy is zero (∆U = 0), so:\n\nQ = W\n\nWe are given that the gas absorbs 500 J of heat (Q = 500 J). Therefore, the work done by the gas during this process is also 500 J.\n\nW = 500 J"
