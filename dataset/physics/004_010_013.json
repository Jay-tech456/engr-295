    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a non-rotating black hole is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula to find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nr_s â‰ˆ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius is directly related to the event horizon of a black hole. The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. For a non-rotating black hole, the event horizon is a sphere with a radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius. In this case, the event horizon would be a sphere with a radius of approximately 29.5 kilometers. Anything that crosses this boundary will be inevitably pulled into the black hole and cannot escape."
