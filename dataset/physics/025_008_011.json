    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated by a single muscle fiber during contraction, we can use the following formula:\n\nForce = Cross-sectional area × Contractile force per unit area\n\nGiven the cross-sectional area (A), contractile force per unit area (F/A), and the physiological range of lengths (L1 and L2), we can calculate the force generated by the muscle fiber at different lengths within the physiological range.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the contractile force per unit area (F/A). This value can vary depending on the type of muscle fiber and the specific conditions under which the muscle is contracting. For this example, let's assume a contractile force per unit area of 20 N/cm².\n\nNext, we need the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber. Let's assume a cross-sectional area of 0.1 cm².\n\nNow we can calculate the force generated by the muscle fiber:\n\nForce = 0.1 cm² × 20 N/cm² = 2 N\n\nThis means that the muscle fiber generates a force of 2 N during contraction.\n\nTo determine the force generated at different lengths"
