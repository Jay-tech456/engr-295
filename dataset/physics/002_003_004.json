    "message_2": "To determine the internal energy of the steam, we need to find the specific internal energy (u) and then multiply it by the mass (m) of the steam.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy is a function of temperature only and can be determined using the equation:\n\nu = Cv * T\n\nwhere u is the specific internal energy, Cv is the specific heat at constant volume, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 250°C + 273.15 = 523.15 K\n\nNext, we need to find the specific heat at constant volume (Cv) for steam. For water vapor (steam), Cv is approximately 1.996 kJ/kg·K.\n\nNow, we can calculate the specific internal energy (u):\n\nu = Cv * T = 1.996 kJ/kg·K * 523.15 K = 1044.25 kJ/kg\n\nFinally, we can find the total internal energy by multiplying the specific internal energy by the mass of the steam:\n\nInternal energy = m * u = 5 kg * 1044.25 kJ/kg = 5221.25 kJ\n\nTherefore, the internal energy of the steam in the piston-cylinder device is approximately 5221.25 kJ."
