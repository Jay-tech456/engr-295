    "message_2": "To calculate the scattering amplitude of two electrons exchanging a virtual photon in a Feynman diagram using Quantum Field Theory, we will use the Feynman rules for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The process we are considering is electron-electron scattering, also known as Møller scattering.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the scattering amplitude:\n\n1. Draw the Feynman diagram: In this case, we have two incoming electrons (labeled 1 and 2) and two outgoing electrons (labeled 3 and 4). The electrons exchange a virtual photon (labeled γ) in the process.\n\n2. Assign momenta: Assign 4-momenta to each incoming and outgoing electron (p1, p2, p3, and p4) and the virtual photon (q). Conservation of momentum at each vertex gives q = p1 - p3 = p2 - p4.\n\n3. Write down the amplitude using Feynman rules: The amplitude for this process is given by the product of the electron propagator, the photon propagator, and the interaction vertices.\n\nThe electron propagator is given by:\nS(p) = (i / (p^2 - m^2 + iε))\n\nThe photon propagator is given by:\nDμν(q) = (-i gμν) / (q^2 + iε)\n\nThe interaction vertex is given by:\n-ig_e γμ\n\nHere, m is the electron mass, g_e is the electron charge, and ε is a small positive number to ensure the correct pole prescription.\n\n4. Combine the propagators and vertices: The scattering amplitude M for the process is given by:\n\nM = (-ig_e) u_bar(p3) γμ u(p1) (-ig_e) u_bar(p4) γν u(p2) (-i gμν) / (q^2 + iε)\n\n5. Calculate the squared amplitude: To obtain the probability of the process, we need to calculate the squared amplitude, |M|^2, and sum over the final spins and average over the initial spins.\n\n6. Integrate over phase space: Finally, to obtain the cross-section, we need to integrate |M|^2 over the phase space of the final state particles.\n\nThis is a general outline of how to calculate the scattering amplitude for two electrons exchanging a virtual photon in a Feynman diagram using Quantum Field Theory. The actual calculation involves some algebra and integration, which is beyond the scope of this response."
