    "message_2": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (∆x) and momentum (∆p) of a particle is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2:\n\n∆x * ∆p ≥ ħ / 2\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength (λ) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) through the equation:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.62607015 × 10^(-34) Js).\n\nGiven the de Broglie wavelength (λ) of the electron is 0.01 nm, we can find its momentum (p):\n\n0.01 nm = 0.01 × 10^(-9) m\n\np = h / λ = (6.62607015 × 10^(-34) Js) / (0.01 × 10^(-9) m) ≈ 6.62607015 × 10^(-25) kg m/s\n\nNow, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in position (∆x):\n\n∆x * ∆p ≥ ħ / 2\n\n∆x ≥ (ħ / 2) / ∆p\n\n∆x ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js / 2) / (6.62607015 × 10^(-25) kg m/s) ≈ 7.975 × 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in position (∆x) is approximately 7.975 × 10^(-11) m, and the uncertainty in momentum (∆p) is approximately 6.62607015 × 10^(-25) kg m/s."
