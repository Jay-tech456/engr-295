    "message_2": "To calculate the NMR frequency of a lithium atom with 3 protons and 4 neutrons in its nucleus, we need to consider the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of the specific isotope. In this case, we are dealing with Lithium-7 (7Li) isotope, which has a gyromagnetic ratio of 16.546 MHz/T.\n\nThe NMR frequency (ν) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nν = γ * B\n\nwhere ν is the NMR frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the magnetic field strength B = 9.4 Tesla, we can calculate the NMR frequency for Lithium-7:\n\nν = 16.546 MHz/T * 9.4 T\n\nν ≈ 155.33 MHz\n\nSo, the NMR frequency of a Lithium atom with 3 protons and 4 neutrons in its nucleus, when placed in a magnetic field of 9.4 Tesla, is approximately 155.33 MHz."
