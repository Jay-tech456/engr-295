    "message_1": "A high-energy electron (mass = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg) is moving at a velocity of 0.75c. It collides head-on with a stationary electron. What is the maximum energy of the scattered electron? Assume a perfectly elastic collision.",
    "message_2": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let's first find the initial momentum and kinetic energy of the high-energy electron.\n\nInitial momentum of high-energy electron (p1_initial):\np1_initial = m1 * v1\nwhere m1 is the mass of the high-energy electron (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) and v1 is its velocity (0.75c).\n\nSince the stationary electron has zero initial velocity, its initial momentum is also zero.\n\nInitial kinetic energy of high-energy electron (KE1_initial):\nKE1_initial = (1/2) * m1 * v1^2\n\nNow, let's denote the final velocities of the high-energy electron and the stationary electron after the collision as v1_final and v2_final, respectively.\n\nFinal momentum of high-energy electron (p1_final):\np1_final = m1 * v1_final\n\nFinal momentum of stationary electron (p2_final):\np2_final = m1 * v2_final\n\nConservation of momentum:\np1_initial = p1_final + p2_final\nm1 * v1 = m1 * v1_final + m1 * v2_final\n\nFinal kinetic energy of high-energy electron (KE1_final):\nKE1_final = (1/2) * m1 * v1_final^2\n\nFinal kinetic energy of stationary electron (KE2_final):\nKE2_final = (1/2) * m1 * v2_final^2\n\nConservation of kinetic energy:\nKE1_initial = KE1_final + KE2_final\n(1/2) * m1 * v1^2 = (1/2) * m1 * v1_final^2 + (1/2) * m1 * v2_final^2\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns (v1_final and v2_final). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the final velocities.\n\nDivide the momentum conservation equation by m1:\nv1 = v1_final + v2_final\n\nSquare both sides:\nv1^2 = v1_final^2 + 2 * v1_final * v2_final + v2_final^2\n\nSubstitute the kinetic energy conservation equation:\n(1/2) * m1 * v1^2 = (1/2) * m1 * (v1_final^2 + v2_final^2)\n\nCancel out the (1/2) * m1 terms:\nv1^2 = v1_final^2 + v2_final^2\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1) v1^2 = v1_final^2 + v2_final^2\n2) v1^2 = v1_final^2 + 2 * v1_final * v2_final + v2_final^2\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n0 = 2 * v1_final * v2_final\n\nSince v1_final and v2_final cannot both be zero (otherwise, there would be no collision), one of them must be zero. If v1_final = 0, then the high-energy electron comes to rest, and the stationary electron takes all the momentum and energy. This is the maximum energy transfer scenario.\n\nSo, the maximum energy of the scattered electron (initially stationary) is equal to the initial kinetic energy of the high-energy electron:\n\nMax_energy_scattered_electron = KE1_initial\n= (1/2) * m1 * v1^2\n= (1/2) * (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (0.75c)^2\n= (1/2) * (9.11 x 10^-31 kg) * (0.75 * 3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nMax_energy_scattered_electron â‰ˆ 2.44 x 10^-14 J"
