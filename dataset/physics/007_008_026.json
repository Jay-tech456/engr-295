    "message_2": "In nuclear medicine procedures, the radiation dose a patient receives depends on the specific test being performed and the radiopharmaceutical used. The maximum dose of radiation that a person can safely receive during a single diagnostic nuclear medicine procedure is typically expressed in millisieverts (mSv).\n\nFor most diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures, the effective dose ranges from 1 to 20 mSv, with many common procedures falling between 2 to 6 mSv. For example, a bone scan typically delivers an effective dose of around 3 to 6 mSv, while a heart scan (myocardial perfusion imaging) may result in an effective dose of 9 to 15 mSv.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the average natural background radiation dose that a person receives in a year is about 2.4 mSv. This value, however, can vary depending on factors such as geographical location, altitude, and occupation.\n\nIt is important to note that the benefits of undergoing a diagnostic nuclear medicine procedure typically outweigh the risks associated with the radiation exposure. The doses used in these procedures are carefully chosen to minimize risk while still providing the necessary diagnostic information for the patient's medical care."
