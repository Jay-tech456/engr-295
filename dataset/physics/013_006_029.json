    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in a supernova explosion, we need to consider two main sources of energy: the gravitational binding energy and the energy from radioactive decay.\n\n1. Gravitational binding energy: This is the energy required to disassemble the star into its individual particles. For a star with mass M and radius R, the gravitational binding energy can be estimated using the formula:\n\nE_grav = (3/5) * G * M^2 / R\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 Ã— 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2).\n\n2. Radioactive decay energy: The energy released from radioactive decay mainly comes from the decay of isotopes like nickel-56 and cobalt-56. The decay energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_decay = N * Q\n\nwhere N is the number of radioactive nuclei and Q is the energy released per decay.\n\nTo find the total energy released in the supernova explosion, we add the gravitational binding energy and the radioactive decay energy:\n\nE_total = E_grav + E_decay\n\nHowever, without specific values for the mass of the star, its radius, and the amount of radioactive decay, we cannot provide a numerical answer. Once you have these values, you can plug them into the formulas above to calculate the energy released in the supernova explosion."
