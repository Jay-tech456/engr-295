    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a specific task for a physics student:\n\nCalculate the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion reaction of methane (CH4) at constant temperature and pressure. Given the standard enthalpy of combustion of methane is -890.3 kJ/mol and the standard entropy change of combustion is -242 J/(mol*K).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion reaction of methane at constant temperature and pressure, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.\n\nGiven the standard enthalpy of combustion of methane (ΔH) is -890.3 kJ/mol and the standard entropy change of combustion (ΔS) is -242 J/(mol*K), we can plug these values into the equation. However, we need to convert the entropy change to kJ/(mol*K) first:\n\nΔS = -242 J/(mol*K) * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.242 kJ/(mol*K)\n\nNow, we need the temperature (T) to calculate ΔG. Assuming the reaction occurs at room temperature (25°C), we can convert this to Kelvin:\n\nT = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow we can plug all the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = (-890.3 kJ/mol) - (298.15 K * -0.242 kJ/(mol*K))\nΔG = -890.3 kJ/mol + 72.2 kJ/mol\nΔG = -818.1 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion reaction of methane at constant temperature and pressure is approximately -818.1 kJ/mol."
