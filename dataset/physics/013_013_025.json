    "message_2": "The theoretical maximum mass of a neutron star is determined by the balance between the inward gravitational force and the outward pressure from neutron degeneracy and other forces. This limit is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The exact value of the TOV limit depends on the equation of state (EOS) of the ultra-dense matter inside the neutron star, which is still an area of active research in nuclear physics.\n\nCurrent estimates for the maximum mass of a neutron star range from about 2 to 2.5 solar masses. Observations of neutron stars with masses close to or above 2 solar masses provide important constraints on the EOS and help rule out some theoretical models.\n\nSupermassive neutron stars, if they exist, would be neutron stars with masses significantly larger than the TOV limit. However, there is currently no strong observational evidence for the existence of such objects. Neutron stars with masses significantly larger than the TOV limit are expected to collapse into black holes due to their strong gravitational pull.\n\nIf supermassive neutron stars were discovered, it would have significant implications for our understanding of the EOS of ultra-dense matter and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. It would also challenge our current understanding of the stability and evolution of compact objects in the universe."
