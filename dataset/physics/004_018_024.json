    "message_2": "To calculate the change in frequency due to gravitational redshift, we can use the formula:\n\nΔf/f = (ΔU)/c^2\n\nwhere Δf is the change in frequency, f is the initial frequency, ΔU is the change in gravitational potential energy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe change in gravitational potential energy can be calculated using:\n\nΔU = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object (in this case, the clock), g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet, and h is the height the clock is raised.\n\nHowever, since we are interested in the fractional change in frequency, we can ignore the mass of the clock, as it will cancel out in the final equation. Thus, we have:\n\nΔf/f = (g * h)/c^2\n\nTo find the actual change in frequency, we need to know the initial frequency of the light emitted by the clock, the acceleration due to gravity on the planet, and the height the clock is raised. With these values, we can plug them into the equation above to find the change in frequency due to gravitational redshift."
