    "message_2": "To calculate the linear thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the crystal, we can use the formula:\n\nα = ΔL / (L₀ * ΔT)\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L₀ is the initial length, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in length (ΔL) and the change in temperature (ΔT).\n\nΔL = final length - initial length\nΔL = 5.09 cm - 5 cm\nΔL = 0.09 cm\n\nΔT = final temperature - initial temperature\nΔT = 100°C - 25°C\nΔT = 75°C\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nα = ΔL / (L₀ * ΔT)\nα = 0.09 cm / (5 cm * 75°C)\nα = 0.09 cm / 375 cm°C\nα = 0.00024 /°C\n\nThe linear thermal expansion coefficient of the crystal is 2.4 x 10^-4 /°C."
