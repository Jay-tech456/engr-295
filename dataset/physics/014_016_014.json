    "message_2": "The maximum safe level of exposure to cosmic radiation for astronauts on long-duration space missions is determined by guidelines set by various space agencies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has established a career limit for astronauts, which is 3-4% increased risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to cancer. This limit is equivalent to a dose of approximately 1 sievert (Sv) for a typical astronaut.\n\nTo minimize the harmful effects of cosmic rays on human health, several measures can be taken:\n\n1. Shielding: Using materials with high hydrogen content, such as water, polyethylene, or other specialized materials, can help absorb and deflect incoming cosmic rays. The spacecraft's design can also incorporate additional shielding in areas where astronauts sleep or spend most of their time.\n\n2. Spacecraft design: Designing spacecraft with a low-mass, compact structure can help reduce the overall exposure to cosmic rays. Additionally, arranging the spacecraft's components and supplies in a way that provides additional shielding can be beneficial.\n\n3. Mission planning: Limiting the duration of space missions and avoiding periods of high solar activity can help reduce astronauts' exposure to cosmic radiation. Planning missions during solar maximum, when the sun's magnetic field is stronger, can also help deflect galactic cosmic rays.\n\n4. Personal dosimetry: Monitoring individual astronaut's radiation exposure using personal dosimeters can help ensure that they do not exceed the recommended limits.\n\n5. Medical countermeasures: Developing pharmaceuticals or other medical interventions that can mitigate the effects of radiation exposure is an area of ongoing research. These countermeasures could potentially help reduce the risk of radiation-induced health issues.\n\n6. Radiation forecasting and alerts: Utilizing space weather forecasting to predict periods of high radiation exposure and providing alerts to astronauts can help them take necessary precautions, such as moving to a more shielded area of the spacecraft.\n\nIn summary, the maximum safe level of exposure to cosmic radiation for astronauts on long-duration space missions is about 1 sievert, and various measures can be taken to minimize the harmful effects of cosmic rays on human health, including shielding, spacecraft design, mission planning, personal dosimetry, medical countermeasures, and radiation forecasting and alerts."
