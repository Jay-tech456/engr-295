    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of fission occurring in a Uranium-235 nucleus when it is bombarded by a neutron with kinetic energy of 2 MeV, we need to determine the fission cross-section for this reaction. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that a specific nuclear reaction will occur.\n\nThe Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) is a comprehensive database of evaluated nuclear data, including cross-sections for various reactions. To obtain the fission cross-section for U-235 at 2 MeV neutron energy, we can refer to the ENDF database.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to obtain the fission cross-section for U-235 at 2 MeV neutron energy from the ENDF database:\n\n1. Go to the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) website: https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/\n\n2. Click on the \"ENDF Retrieval & Plotting\" link under the \"Databases\" section.\n\n3. Select \"ENDF/B-VIII.0\" as the library, which is the latest version of the ENDF database.\n\n4. In the \"Target\" field, enter \"U-235\" and click \"Search.\"\n\n5. In the search results, click on the \"MF=3, MT=18\" link, which corresponds to the fission cross-section data.\n\n6. In the \"Energy (eV)\" field, enter \"2.0E+6\" (2 MeV in electron volts) and click \"Submit.\"\n\n7. The result will show the fission cross-section for U-235 at 2 MeV neutron energy.\n\nFor comparison, we can also look at experimental cross-section data. The experimental data can be found in various publications and databases, such as the EXFOR database. It is important to note that experimental data may vary slightly between different sources due to uncertainties and experimental conditions.\n\nTo compare the ENDF cross-section with experimental data, we can plot both data sets on the same graph and analyze the differences. If the ENDF data closely matches the experimental data, it indicates that the ENDF data is a reliable representation of the fission cross-section for U-235 at 2 MeV neutron energy.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of fission occurring in a Uranium-235 nucleus when it is bombarded by a neutron with kinetic energy of 2 MeV can be determined by calculating the fission cross-section using the ENDF database and comparing it with experimental data. This will provide a reliable estimate of the probability of the reaction occurring under the given conditions."
