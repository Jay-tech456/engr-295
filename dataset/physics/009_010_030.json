    "message_2": "To find the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to determine the image distance using the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 10 cm, u = -5 cm (object distance is negative for real objects in front of the mirror)\n\n1/10 = 1/(-5) + 1/v\n\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/5 = 3/10\n\nv = 10/3 cm (positive value indicates the image is virtual and behind the mirror)\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(10/3) / (-5)\n\nM = 2\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is 2, meaning the image is twice the size of the object."
