    "message_2": "To calculate the Boyle temperature, we need to use the concept of the ideal gas law and the definition of Boyle temperature. The ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a gas obeys Boyle's law exactly, meaning that the product of pressure and volume is constant for a fixed amount of gas at that temperature. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nPV = constant\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information. Initially, the gas occupies a volume of 2 L at 27°C (300 K) and 1 atm pressure. After the volume is reduced to 1 L, the pressure remains the same at 1 atm. We need to find the Boyle temperature (T_B) at which the gas obeys Boyle's law exactly.\n\nLet's use the ideal gas law for the initial and final states:\n\nP1V1 = nR(T1)\nP2V2 = nR(T_B)\n\nSince the pressure remains constant (P1 = P2 = 1 atm), we can write:\n\nV1 = nR(T1)\nV2 = nR(T_B)\n\nNow, let's divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(V2/V1) = (nR(T_B))/(nR(T1))\n\nSince n and R are constants, they cancel out:\n\n(V2/V1) = (T_B/T1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for T_B:\n\n(1 L / 2 L) = (T_B / 300 K)\n\n0.5 = T_B / 300 K\n\nT_B = 0.5 * 300 K = 150 K\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature of the substance is 150 K."
