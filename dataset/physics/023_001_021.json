    "message_2": "The minimum number of qubits needed for a quantum error correction code capable of correcting a single qubit error is 5. This is known as the 5-qubit code or the smallest perfect code. It can correct any single-qubit error and protect one logical qubit.\n\nAs for the general case, if you want to protect k logical qubits against t errors, the number of physical qubits needed can be determined using the quantum Hamming bound. The quantum Hamming bound is given by:\n\nQ(n, k, t) ≤ 2^n - 2^k - t * (2^(n-k) - 1) ≥ 0\n\nWhere Q(n, k, t) is the number of quantum states, n is the number of physical qubits, and k is the number of logical qubits.\n\nSolving this inequality for n will give you the minimum number of physical qubits needed to protect k logical qubits against t errors. However, finding the exact value of n for a given k and t can be a complex task and may require numerical methods or optimization techniques."
