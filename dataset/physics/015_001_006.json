    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / (c⁴ * d)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of the gravitational wave\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\nM = total mass of the binary system (in kg)\nω = angular frequency of the orbit (in rad/s)\nr = separation between the black holes (in meters)\nc = speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\nd = distance from the observer to the binary system (in meters)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg\n\nMass of first black hole (m1) = 10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg\nMass of second black hole (m2) = 20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 3.978 × 10³¹ kg\n\nTotal mass (M) = m1 + m2 = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg + 3.978 × 10³¹ kg = 5.967 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to calculate the angular frequency of the orbit. We can use the following formula:\n\nω² = (G * (m1 + m2)) / r³\n\nwhere r is the separation between the black holes in meters. We need to convert the given separation from kilometers to meters:\n\nr = 500 km = 500 * 10³ m = 5 × 10⁵ m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular frequency:\n\nω² = (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 5.967 × 10³¹ kg) / (5 × 10⁵ m)³\nω² ≈ 1.602 × 10⁻² rad²/s²\nω ≈ 0.126 rad/s\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational wave. We need to know the distance from the observer to the binary system (d). Since it's not provided, we'll keep it as a variable:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 5.967 × 10³¹ kg * (0.126 rad/s)² * 5 × 10⁵ m) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴ * d\nh ≈ 1.34 × 10⁻²² / d\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational wave depends on the distance from the observer to the binary system. The closer the observer is to the binary system, the larger the amplitude of the gravitational wave."
