    "message_2": "To calculate the recoil-free fraction (f) for the nuclear transition of an iron-57 nucleus undergoing Mössbauer spectroscopy at room temperature, we need to use the Debye model. The recoil-free fraction is given by the following formula:\n\nf = exp(-2W)\n\nwhere W is the mean square displacement of the nucleus.\n\nFor the Debye model, the mean square displacement (W) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nW = (3 * ħ^2) / (2 * M * k_B * T * Θ_D)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, M is the mass of the iron-57 nucleus, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Θ_D is the Debye temperature.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nħ = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js (reduced Planck's constant)\nM = 57 * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg (mass of iron-57 nucleus, where 1 atomic mass unit = 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27) kg)\nk_B = 1.380649 × 10^(-23) J/K (Boltzmann constant)\nT = 298 K (room temperature)\nΘ_D = 470 K (Debye temperature for iron)\n\nNow, let's calculate W:\n\nW = (3 * (1.0545718 × 10^(-34))^2) / (2 * (57 * 1.66053906660 × 10^(-27)) * (1.380649 × 10^(-23)) * 298 * 470)\nW ≈ 2.083 × 10^(-2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the recoil-free fraction (f):\n\nf = exp(-2 * 2.083 × 10^(-2))\nf ≈ 0.960\n\nSo, the recoil-free fraction for the nuclear transition of an iron-57 nucleus undergoing Mössbauer spectroscopy at room temperature is approximately 0.960 or 96%."
