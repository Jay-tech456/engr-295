What is the velocity of the second spaceship as observed by an observer on the first spaceship? Use the formula for relativistic velocity addition.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the second spaceship as observed by an observer on the first spaceship, we need to use the formula for relativistic velocity addition. The formula is:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the two spaceships, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.8c and v2 = -0.6c (negative because the second spaceship is moving away from Earth in the same direction as the first spaceship).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv = (0.8c + (-0.6c)) / (1 + (0.8c * (-0.6c)) / c^2)\n\nv = (0.2c) / (1 - 0.48)\n\nv = (0.2c) / 0.52\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.3846c\n\nSo, the velocity of the second spaceship as observed by an observer on the first spaceship is approximately 0.3846c."
