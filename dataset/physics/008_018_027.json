    "message_2": "The most precise method for measuring the strong coupling constant (αs) in particle physics experiments is through the use of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations combined with experimental data from high-energy collider experiments, such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nLattice QCD is a non-perturbative approach to solving the equations of QCD, which is the theory describing the strong force between quarks and gluons. By discretizing spacetime into a lattice and using powerful supercomputers, lattice QCD allows for the calculation of αs with high precision.\n\nExperimental data from high-energy collider experiments, such as deep inelastic scattering, jet production, and heavy quarkonium decays, provide additional constraints on the value of αs. By comparing lattice QCD calculations with experimental data, physicists can extract the most precise value of the strong coupling constant.\n\nThe combination of lattice QCD and experimental data has led to the current world-average value of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (MZ) to be αs(MZ) ≈ 0.1181, with an uncertainty of around 0.5%. This precision is crucial for understanding the behavior of the strong force and making accurate predictions in particle physics."
