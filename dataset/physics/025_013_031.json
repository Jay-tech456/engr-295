    "message_2": "The perception of color by the human eye is directly related to the wavelength of light. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and its wavelength determines its color. The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm, with each color corresponding to a specific range of wavelengths.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and the lens, which focus the light onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light.\n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the human eye, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths. These are:\n\n1. S-cones: Sensitive to short wavelengths, these cones perceive blue light (approximately 400-500 nm).\n2. M-cones: Sensitive to medium wavelengths, these cones perceive green light (approximately 450-630 nm).\n3. L-cones: Sensitive to long wavelengths, these cones perceive red light (approximately 500-700 nm).\n\nWhen light of a specific wavelength enters the eye, it stimulates the corresponding cone cells. The information from these cells is then sent to the brain via the optic nerve, where it is processed and interpreted as a specific color.\n\nFor example, if light with a wavelength of 450 nm enters the eye, it will primarily stimulate the S-cones, and the brain will perceive the color as blue. Similarly, if light with a wavelength of 600 nm enters the eye, it will primarily stimulate the L-cones, and the brain will perceive the color as red.\n\nIt is important to note that the perception of color is not solely determined by the wavelength of light. Factors such as the intensity of light, the presence of other colors, and individual differences in the structure and function of the eye can also influence color perception.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light directly affects the perception of color by the human eye through the stimulation of specific cone cells in the retina, which then send information to the brain to be processed and interpreted as a specific color."
