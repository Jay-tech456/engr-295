    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino oscillating from one flavor to another, we use the formula for neutrino oscillation probability. For a two-flavor neutrino oscillation, the probability of an electron neutrino (νe) oscillating into a muon neutrino (νμ) is given by:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\nθ is the mixing angle between the two neutrino flavors,\nΔm² is the difference in the squares of the neutrino masses (in eV²),\nL is the distance from the source to the detector (in km),\nE is the neutrino energy (in MeV).\n\nSince the neutrino oscillation parameters are known, we can plug in the values for θ, Δm², L, and E to calculate the probability.\n\nFor example, let's assume the following values for the neutrino oscillation parameters (these are not the actual values, but just an example):\n\nθ = 45° (or π/4 in radians),\nΔm² = 2.5 x 10⁻³ eV².\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2 * π/4) * sin²(1.27 * 2.5 x 10⁻³ * 1 / 2)\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(π/2) * sin²(1.59 x 10⁻³)\nP(νe → νμ) = 1 * sin²(1.59 x 10⁻³)\n\nCalculating the value of sin²(1.59 x 10⁻³):\n\nsin²(1.59 x 10⁻³) ≈ (1.59 x 10⁻³)² = 2.53 x 10⁻⁶\n\nSo, the probability of an electron neutrino oscillating into a muon neutrino at a distance of 1 km from the reactor with an energy of 2 MeV is approximately:\n\nP(νe → νμ) ≈ 2.53 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis means there is a very low probability (about 0.000253%) of an electron neutrino produced in a nuclear reactor being measured as a muon neutrino at a distance of 1 km with an energy of 2 MeV, given the example oscillation parameters. Keep in mind that the actual probability will depend on the real values of the neutrino oscillation parameters."
