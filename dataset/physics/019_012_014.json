    "message_2": "The best method for calculating non-perturbative effects in a specific quantum field theory (QFT) model depends on the particular model and the physical context. However, some widely used non-perturbative methods include lattice field theory, the functional renormalization group, and the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n\n1. Lattice field theory: This approach involves discretizing spacetime on a lattice and then performing numerical simulations to compute non-perturbative quantities. Lattice field theory is particularly successful in the study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. It has been used to calculate properties of hadrons, confinement, and the QCD phase diagram.\n\n2. Functional renormalization group (FRG): The FRG is a powerful method for studying non-perturbative effects in QFT. It is based on the idea of integrating out fluctuations at different energy scales, leading to a flow of the effective action. The method allows for the study of fixed points, phase transitions, and the behavior of the system at different energy scales.\n\n3. AdS/CFT correspondence: Also known as the holographic principle or gauge/gravity duality, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured equivalence between certain strongly coupled gauge theories and weakly coupled gravity theories in higher-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. This duality allows for the study of non-perturbative effects in strongly coupled gauge theories by mapping them to weakly coupled gravity theories, which are more tractable.\n\nNon-perturbative effects can have significant impacts on the behavior of a QFT system at different energy scales. For example:\n\n1. Confinement: In QCD, non-perturbative effects lead to the confinement of quarks and gluons inside hadrons at low energies. This phenomenon cannot be explained by perturbative methods.\n\n2. Chiral symmetry breaking: In QCD, non-perturbative effects are responsible for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which gives rise to the masses of light quarks and the formation of a condensate.\n\n3. Phase transitions: Non-perturbative effects can lead to phase transitions in QFT systems, such as the transition from a confined phase to a deconfined phase in QCD at high temperatures or densities.\n\n4. Topological effects: Non-perturbative effects can give rise to topological structures, such as instantons and monopoles, which play crucial roles in the dynamics of certain QFT systems.\n\nIn summary, the choice of the best method for calculating non-perturbative effects in a specific QFT model depends on the model and the physical context. Non-perturbative effects can have significant impacts on the behavior of the system at different energy scales, leading to phenomena such as confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, phase transitions, and topological effects."
