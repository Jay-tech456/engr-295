    "message_2": "To calculate the length contraction of an object moving at a high velocity relative to an observer, we use the Lorentz contraction formula:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length at rest), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, L0 = 3 meters and v = 0.8c.\n\nL = 3 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\n\nL = 3 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\nL = 3 * sqrt(0.36)\n\nL = 3 * 0.6\n\nL = 1.8 meters\n\nThe measured length of the 3-meter-long object moving at a velocity of 0.8c relative to an observer at rest would be 1.8 meters."
