    "message_2": "Experimental Setup:\n\n1. Sample preparation: Prepare a sample containing a large number of two-qubit systems, such as a liquid-state solution of molecules with two spin-1/2 nuclei (e.g., Carbon-13 and Hydrogen-1). These nuclei will serve as our qubits. The sample should be placed in a strong, homogeneous magnetic field (B0) to create a Zeeman splitting between the spin states of the nuclei.\n\n2. Initialization: Apply a series of radiofrequency (RF) pulses and magnetic field gradients to initialize the qubits into a known state, such as the |00> state, where both qubits are in their lowest energy state.\n\n3. Entanglement generation: Apply a selective RF pulse resonant with the Carbon-13 nucleus to create a superposition state of the first qubit (|0> + |1>). Then, apply a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate between the two qubits, which can be implemented using a combination of RF pulses and J-coupling evolution. The J-coupling is a scalar coupling between the two nuclei mediated by the electrons in the molecule. This will result in the entangled state:\n\n|Ψ> = 1/√2 (|00> + |11>)\n\n4. Measurement: To verify the entanglement, we will perform a series of measurements on the two-qubit system. First, apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the first qubit, followed by a CNOT gate between the two qubits. Finally, apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit. This sequence of gates will disentangle the qubits if they were initially entangled. Measure the populations of the four possible states (|00>, |01>, |10>, and |11>) using standard NMR techniques, such as observing the free induction decay (FID) after applying a readout pulse and Fourier transforming the signal to obtain the NMR spectrum.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nIf the qubits were initially entangled, the final state after applying the gates in the measurement step should be:\n\n|Ψ'> = 1/√2 (|00> + |11>)\n\nThis means that the populations of the |01> and |10> states should be negligible, while the populations of the |00> and |11> states should be equal and close to 50%. If the qubits were not entangled, the populations of all four states would be non-negligible and not equal.\n\nBy comparing the measured populations of the four states to the theoretical predictions, we can confirm the presence of quantum entanglement in our two-qubit system. The success of the experiment can be quantified by calculating the fidelity between the measured state and the expected entangled state, which should be close to 1 for a high-quality entanglement demonstration."
