    "message_2": "The rate of cosmic ray background radiation on Earth varies depending on factors such as altitude, latitude, and solar activity. On average, at sea level, the dose rate is approximately 0.1 microsieverts per hour (µSv/h). This increases with altitude, reaching about 1-5 µSv/h during a commercial airplane flight.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy particles, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, originating from outer space. When they enter the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with air molecules, creating secondary particles such as neutrons, muons, and other subatomic particles. These secondary particles contribute to the background radiation dose that humans are exposed to.\n\nThe potential harmful effects of cosmic ray background radiation on human health are relatively low for people living at or near sea level. The average annual dose from cosmic rays is about 0.3-0.6 millisieverts (mSv), which is a small fraction of the total annual background radiation dose of approximately 2-3 mSv from all sources (including natural and man-made sources).\n\nHowever, for people living at high altitudes or those who frequently travel by air, the exposure to cosmic rays is higher. Long-term exposure to increased levels of cosmic radiation can increase the risk of cancer, particularly leukemia and brain tumors. Additionally, cosmic rays can cause damage to electronic devices and may pose a risk to astronauts during space missions.\n\nIt is important to note that the risk of harmful effects from cosmic ray background radiation is relatively low compared to other sources of radiation exposure, such as medical imaging procedures or radon gas exposure. Nonetheless, understanding and monitoring cosmic radiation exposure is essential for assessing potential health risks and implementing protective measures, particularly for high-risk groups such as astronauts and frequent flyers."
