    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of current, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the wire, and x is the distance from the center of the wire to point P.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nI = 5 A\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.2 m\n\nFirst, let's calculate (R² + x²)^(3/2):\n\n(R² + x²)^(3/2) = (0.1² + 0.2²)^(3/2) = (0.01 + 0.04)^(3/2) = 0.05^(3/2) = 0.1118 m^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.1² m²) / (2 * 0.1118 m^(3/2))\nB = (6.2832 × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (0.2236 m^(3/2))\nB = 6.2832 × 10^(-9) Tm² / 0.2236 m\nB = 2.810 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 2.81 × 10^(-8) T."
