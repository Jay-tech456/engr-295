    "message_2": "The strong nuclear force, also known as the strong force or strong interaction, is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. The strong force is much stronger than the electromagnetic force, which would otherwise cause the positively charged protons to repel each other and break apart the nucleus.\n\nThe range of the strong nuclear force is very short, typically around 1 to 3 femtometers (1 femtometer = 10^-15 meters). Due to its short range, the strong force only acts between protons and neutrons that are very close to each other within the nucleus.\n\nThe strength of the strong nuclear force is determined by the coupling constant, which is approximately 1. This makes it about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force, but its strength decreases rapidly as the distance between the interacting particles increases.\n\nThe strong nuclear force plays a crucial role in binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus by overcoming the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons. It is mediated by the exchange of particles called gluons, which \"glue\" the protons and neutrons together. The strong force acts between quarks, which are the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons. The residual strong force, which acts between protons and neutrons, is a result of the underlying strong force between quarks.\n\nIn summary, the strong nuclear force has a short range of about 1 to 3 femtometers and is much stronger than the electromagnetic force. It plays a crucial role in binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, overcoming the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons."
