    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects the distortion of light as it passes by a massive object, such as a galaxy, through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing occurs when the mass of an object, like a galaxy, bends the spacetime around it, causing the light from distant objects to follow a curved path. This bending of light can cause the distant objects to appear distorted, magnified, or even multiply imaged.\n\nDark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, contributes to the overall mass of a galaxy. Since gravitational lensing depends on the mass of the object causing the lensing effect, the presence of dark matter can significantly enhance the lensing effect compared to what would be expected from the visible matter alone.\n\nTo differentiate between the effects of ordinary matter (also known as baryonic matter) and dark matter on gravitational lensing, astronomers use a variety of techniques:\n\n1. Mass distribution modeling: By studying the distribution of visible matter in a galaxy, astronomers can create models of the mass distribution and compare the predicted lensing effects with the observed lensing. If the observed lensing is stronger than what is predicted by the visible matter alone, this can be an indication of the presence of dark matter.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: By measuring the rotation speeds of stars and gas in a galaxy, astronomers can infer the distribution of mass within the galaxy. If the rotation speeds do not decrease with distance from the galactic center as expected from the visible matter distribution, this can be evidence for the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Weak lensing studies: Weak lensing refers to the subtle distortions of background galaxies caused by the presence of massive foreground structures, such as galaxy clusters. By analyzing the statistical properties of these distortions, astronomers can infer the distribution of mass within the foreground structures, including the contribution from dark matter.\n\n4. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and contains information about the early universe. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, astronomers can infer the distribution of matter, including dark matter, in the early universe. This information can be used to constrain the properties of dark matter and its effects on gravitational lensing.\n\nBy combining these techniques, astronomers can differentiate between the effects of ordinary matter and dark matter on gravitational lensing and gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of dark matter in the universe."
