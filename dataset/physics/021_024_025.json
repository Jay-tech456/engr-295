    "message_2": "To calculate the expected change in the cosmic neutrino background (CNB) radiation due to the presence of a black hole, we need to consider the gravitational effects of the black hole on the surrounding neutrino distribution. The CNB is a relic from the early universe, and its temperature is estimated to be around 1.95 K.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given distance and mass into more convenient units:\n\n1 billion light years = 9.461 x 10^24 meters (using 1 light year = 9.461 x 10^15 meters)\nMass of the black hole = 10^8 solar masses = 1.989 x 10^38 kg (using 1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg)\n\nNow, let's calculate the gravitational potential energy (ΔU) of a neutrino at the distance of 1 billion light years from the black hole:\n\nΔU = -GMm/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, m is the mass of a neutrino, and r is the distance from the black hole.\n\nThe mass of a neutrino is not well known, but it is estimated to be less than 1 eV/c^2. For our calculation, we will assume the mass of a neutrino to be 1 eV/c^2, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). Converting the mass of a neutrino to kg:\n\nm = (1 eV/c^2) * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) / (c^2) ≈ 1.783 x 10^-36 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the gravitational potential energy:\n\nΔU = -(6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^38 kg) * (1.783 x 10^-36 kg) / (9.461 x 10^24 m)\nΔU ≈ -2.36 x 10^-22 J\n\nThe change in the CNB radiation due to the black hole can be estimated by comparing the gravitational potential energy to the average energy of a neutrino in the CNB. The average energy of a neutrino in the CNB is given by:\n\nE_avg = 3kT/2\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K) and T is the temperature of the CNB (1.95 K).\n\nE_avg = (3 * 1.381 x 10^-23 J/K * 1.95 K) / 2 ≈ 4.05 x 10^-23 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected change in the CNB radiation as a percentage:\n\nΔE/E_avg = (ΔU / E_avg) * 100\nΔE/E_avg ≈ (-2.36 x 10^-22 J / 4.05 x 10^-23 J) * 100 ≈ -58.3%\n\nThis result indicates that the presence of a black hole with a mass of 10^8 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light years from Earth could cause a decrease in the cosmic neutrino background radiation by approximately 58.3%. However, this is a rough estimation and should be taken with caution, as the actual effect could be different due to various factors not considered in this simple calculation."
