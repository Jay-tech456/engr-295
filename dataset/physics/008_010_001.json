    "message_1": "What is the numerical value of the CKM matrix element Vud, which describes the probability of a down-type quark in the neutron to transition to an up-type quark during the decay of a neutron to a proton and an electron-antineutrino?",
    "message_2": "The CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix is a unitary matrix that describes the mixing of quark flavors in weak decays. The matrix element Vud represents the transition probability of a down quark changing into an up quark during the decay of a neutron to a proton and an electron-antineutrino.\n\nThe numerical value of the CKM matrix element Vud is not a fixed constant but rather an experimentally determined value with some uncertainty. As of the 2020 Particle Data Group (PDG) review, the value of Vud is:\n\nVud = 0.97370 Â± 0.00015\n\nThis value is subject to change as more precise experimental measurements are made."
