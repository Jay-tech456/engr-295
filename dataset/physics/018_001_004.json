    "message_2": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It is designed to reach a maximum collision energy of 14 teraelectronvolts (TeV) for proton-proton collisions. This is significantly higher than the energy levels achieved in other particle accelerators around the world.\n\nFor comparison, the second most powerful particle accelerator, the Tevatron at Fermilab in the United States, reached a maximum collision energy of 1.96 TeV for proton-antiproton collisions before it was shut down in 2011. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States can reach energies of up to 200 gigaelectronvolts (GeV) per nucleon for heavy ion collisions.\n\nThe LHC's high energy levels have allowed physicists to explore new frontiers in particle physics, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, which confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and helped to explain the origin of mass for elementary particles."
