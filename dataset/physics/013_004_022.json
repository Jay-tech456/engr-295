    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects the gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by increasing the total mass of the lensing object, such as a galaxy cluster. This, in turn, increases the gravitational force exerted on the light coming from the background galaxies, causing the light to bend more than it would if only the visible mass were present. This bending of light results in the observed phenomenon of gravitational lensing.\n\nGravitational lensing is a consequence of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which states that mass curves spacetime, causing light to follow curved paths as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object. The greater the mass of the lensing object, the more pronounced the lensing effect will be.\n\nTo calculate the expected deviation angles for a galaxy cluster with a known mass and dark matter distribution, we can use the lens equation:\n\nθ = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * r)\n\nwhere θ is the deviation angle, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the total mass of the galaxy cluster (including dark matter), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and r is the distance from the center of the galaxy cluster to the light path.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total mass of the galaxy cluster, which includes both the visible mass and the dark matter mass. This can be done using observational data, such as the velocity dispersion of the galaxies within the cluster, or by modeling the dark matter distribution using simulations.\n\nOnce we have the total mass M, we can plug it into the lens equation along with the other known values to calculate the deviation angle θ. This angle will give us an idea of how much the light from the background galaxies is being bent by the gravitational field of the galaxy cluster.\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation assumes a simplified, idealized scenario, and the actual deviation angles may be affected by other factors, such as the distribution of mass within the galaxy cluster and the specific geometry of the lensing system. In practice, more complex models and numerical simulations are often used to study gravitational lensing in detail and to make predictions about the observed properties of lensed galaxies."
