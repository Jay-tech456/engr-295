    "message_2": "The effective field theory (EFT) approach is a powerful framework in quantum field theory (QFT) that allows us to make predictions for physical processes at different energy scales. It is particularly useful when there is a separation of scales in the problem, meaning that the relevant physics occurs at different energy or length scales. The main idea behind EFT is to focus on the low-energy degrees of freedom and integrate out the high-energy degrees of freedom, which are not directly observable at the low-energy scale.\n\nIn EFT, we construct a theory that is valid only up to a certain energy scale, called the cutoff scale (Λ). This theory includes all the relevant degrees of freedom and interactions at the low-energy scale, while the high-energy degrees of freedom are integrated out. The resulting effective Lagrangian contains an infinite series of terms, organized by their mass dimension. The coefficients of these terms are called Wilson coefficients, and they encode the effects of the high-energy physics.\n\nThe power of EFT lies in its ability to systematically organize the calculations in terms of the ratio of the low-energy scale to the cutoff scale (E/Λ). This allows us to make predictions for physical processes at different energy scales by keeping only the leading terms in this expansion. As a result, EFT provides a systematic and controlled approximation to the full theory, which is often too complicated to handle directly.\n\nLet's consider two specific examples to illustrate the EFT approach:\n\n1. Fermi theory of weak interactions: Before the discovery of the electroweak theory, the weak interactions were described by the Fermi theory, which is an EFT of the full electroweak theory. In this case, the low-energy degrees of freedom are the leptons and nucleons, while the high-energy degrees of freedom (the W and Z bosons) are integrated out. The resulting effective Lagrangian contains a four-fermion interaction term, with a coupling constant proportional to the inverse of the W-boson mass squared. This EFT successfully describes low-energy weak processes, such as beta decay, up to an energy scale of about 100 MeV, which is much smaller than the W-boson mass (~80 GeV).\n\n2. Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT): ChPT is an EFT for low-energy QCD, the theory of strong interactions. At low energies, the relevant degrees of freedom are the pions, which are the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. The high-energy degrees of freedom (quarks and gluons) are integrated out, and the resulting effective Lagrangian is organized as an expansion in powers of the pion momenta and masses. ChPT allows us to make predictions for low-energy hadronic processes, such as pion-pion scattering and pion-nucleon interactions, in a systematic and controlled way.\n\nIn summary, the effective field theory approach is a powerful tool in quantum field theory that allows us to make predictions for physical processes at different energy scales by focusing on the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom and integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom. This approach provides a systematic and controlled approximation to the full theory and has been successfully applied to various areas of particle physics, such as weak interactions and low-energy QCD."
