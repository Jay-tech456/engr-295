    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a current-carrying helix, we need to consider the following parameters:\n\n1. Pitch (p) of the helix: The distance between two consecutive turns along the axis.\n2. Radius (R) of the coils: The distance from the center of the helix to the wire.\n3. Current (I) passing through the helix: The amount of electric charge flowing through the wire per unit time.\n4. Number of turns (N): The total number of loops in the helix.\n\nLet's consider a point P on the axis of the helix at a distance (z) from the center of the helix. We can use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field at point P due to a small segment of the wire. However, due to the helical structure, the magnetic field calculation becomes more complex.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can consider an \"equivalent\" solenoid with the same pitch and radius as the helix. In this case, the magnetic field inside the solenoid can be calculated using Ampere's law.\n\nThe magnetic field (B) inside the solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (N/L, where L is the length of the solenoid), and I is the current passing through the helix.\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the pitch (p) and the length (L) of the solenoid. We can use the following equation:\n\nL = N * p\n\nSo, the number of turns per unit length (n) is:\n\nn = N / L = N / (N * p) = 1 / p\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of n back into the magnetic field equation:\n\nB = μ₀ * (1 / p) * I\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (1 / p) * I\n\nThis equation gives the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a current-carrying helix, taking into account the pitch of the helix, radius of the coils, current passing through it, and the number of turns. Note that this is an approximation and assumes that the magnetic field is uniform inside the solenoid, which may not be accurate for a single helix. However, it provides a reasonable estimate for the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a current-carrying helix."
