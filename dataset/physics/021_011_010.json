    "message_2": "There is a growing body of evidence that supports the theory that black holes played a crucial role in forming the structure of the early universe. Some of the key pieces of evidence include:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the remnant radiation from the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB have revealed small temperature fluctuations, which are believed to be the seeds of the large-scale structure of the universe. Some theories suggest that black holes formed from these density fluctuations, which then led to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n2. Gravitational Waves: The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes provides evidence for the existence of black holes in the early universe. These mergers could have played a role in the formation of the large-scale structure by releasing energy and influencing the distribution of matter.\n\n3. Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): Observations of distant quasars and AGN indicate that supermassive black holes existed in the early universe. These supermassive black holes are believed to have formed from the collapse of massive gas clouds, which then triggered the formation of galaxies around them.\n\n4. Galaxy Formation and Evolution: Simulations of galaxy formation and evolution suggest that black holes play a crucial role in the process. Black holes can influence the distribution of matter in galaxies, regulate star formation, and trigger the formation of new galaxies through mergers.\n\n5. Dark Matter: Although the nature of dark matter is still unknown, some theories propose that primordial black holes could be a candidate for dark matter. These black holes could have formed in the early universe and played a role in shaping the large-scale structure through their gravitational influence.\n\n6. Direct Imaging: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has provided the first direct image of a black hole, which supports the existence of black holes and their role in the universe's structure.\n\nIn summary, evidence from various observations and theoretical models supports the idea that black holes played a crucial role in forming the structure of the early universe. They likely influenced the distribution of matter, regulated star formation, and triggered the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters."
