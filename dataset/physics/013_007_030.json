    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum rotational velocity of a star in the Milky Way galaxy, we need to consider the gravitational force acting on the star due to the mass of the galaxy within the star's orbit. We will use the following assumptions and known values:\n\n1. The mass of the Milky Way galaxy within the star's orbit is approximately 1.5 x 10^11 solar masses (M_sun).\n2. The distance from the galactic center to the star is 30,000 light-years, which we will convert to meters.\n3. The gravitational constant G is 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.\n4. 1 solar mass (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg.\n5. 1 light-year is approximately 9.461 x 10^15 meters.\n\nFirst, let's convert the distance from the galactic center to the star from light-years to meters:\n\n30,000 light-years * (9.461 x 10^15 meters/light-year) = 2.838 x 10^20 meters\n\nNow, we will calculate the mass of the Milky Way galaxy within the star's orbit in kilograms:\n\n1.5 x 10^11 M_sun * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/M_sun) = 2.984 x 10^41 kg\n\nWe can now use the centripetal force equation to find the maximum rotational velocity of the star:\n\nF_gravity = F_centripetal\nG * (M_galaxy * M_star) / r^2 = M_star * v^2 / r\n\nWe can simplify this equation by canceling out M_star and one of the r terms:\n\nv^2 = G * M_galaxy / r\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum rotational velocity (v):\n\nv = sqrt(G * M_galaxy / r)\nv = sqrt((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (2.984 x 10^41 kg) / (2.838 x 10^20 meters))\nv â‰ˆ 2.12 x 10^5 meters/second\n\nSo, the maximum rotational velocity of a star in the Milky Way galaxy, assuming it is orbiting around the galactic center at a distance of 30,000 light-years, is approximately 2.12 x 10^5 meters/second."
