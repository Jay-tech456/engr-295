    "message_2": "The Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV has several possible decay modes. The most probable decay channels are:\n\n1. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (b and b-bar) with a branching ratio of about 58%.\n2. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-) with a branching ratio of about 21%.\n3. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons (tau+ and tau-) with a branching ratio of about 6%.\n4. Higgs boson decaying into a pair of Z bosons (Z and Z) with a branching ratio of about 2.5%.\n\nThese decay modes can be experimentally identified using particle detectors at high-energy physics experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The detectors, like ATLAS and CMS, are designed to measure the energy, momentum, and other properties of the particles produced in the decay processes.\n\nFor example, the decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of bottom quarks can be identified by detecting the jets of particles that result from the hadronization of the bottom quarks. The decay into W or Z bosons can be identified by detecting the decay products of the W and Z bosons, such as electrons, muons, or neutrinos. The decay into tau leptons can be identified by detecting the decay products of the tau leptons, which can include electrons, muons, or hadrons.\n\nBy analyzing the data collected from these detectors and comparing the observed decay patterns with theoretical predictions, physicists can identify the presence of the Higgs boson and study its properties."
