    "message_2": "The mass and angular momentum of a collapsing star play crucial roles in the formation and evolution of a black hole. Let's discuss each factor separately and then see how they interact.\n\n1. Mass:\nThe mass of a collapsing star is the primary factor that determines whether it will form a black hole or not. According to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, a star with a mass greater than approximately 3 times the mass of the Sun (3 solar masses) has the potential to form a black hole after its core collapses.\n\nWhen a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion can no longer counteract the inward pull of gravity. As a result, the core collapses under its own weight, leading to a supernova explosion. If the remaining core mass is above the TOV limit, it will continue to collapse until it forms a black hole.\n\nThe mass of the collapsing star also affects the size of the event horizon (the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull). The event horizon's radius, known as the Schwarzschild radius, is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. A more massive black hole will have a larger event horizon.\n\n2. Angular Momentum:\nAngular momentum, which is the rotational analog of linear momentum, also plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of a black hole. A collapsing star with high angular momentum will form a rotating black hole, also known as a Kerr black hole.\n\nThe rotation of a black hole affects its properties in several ways:\n\n- The event horizon's shape becomes oblate, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n- The rotation drags spacetime around the black hole, a phenomenon known as frame-dragging or the Lense-Thirring effect. This effect causes the orbits of nearby objects to precess and can influence the accretion of matter onto the black hole.\n- A rotating black hole has an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) closer to the event horizon than a non-rotating black hole. This allows matter to orbit closer to the black hole before being swallowed, which can result in more efficient energy release and higher luminosity for accreting black holes.\n\nInteraction between Mass and Angular Momentum:\nThe mass and angular momentum of a collapsing star are not independent factors; they are interconnected. A more massive star is likely to have a higher angular momentum due to its larger size and potentially faster rotation. This means that massive stars are more likely to form rotating black holes.\n\nMoreover, the mass and angular momentum of a black hole can change over time as it accretes matter from its surroundings or merges with other black holes. These processes can cause the black hole to grow in mass and change its rotation rate, further affecting its properties and evolution.\n\nIn summary, the mass and angular momentum of a collapsing star significantly affect the formation and evolution of a black hole. The mass determines whether a black hole will form and influences the size of the event horizon, while the angular momentum affects the black hole's rotation and various properties related to its interaction with the surrounding spacetime and matter."
