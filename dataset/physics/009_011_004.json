    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven: f = 10 cm, u = 20 cm\n\n1/10 = 1/20 + 1/v\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/20 = 1/20\n\nv = 20 cm\n\nSo, the image distance is 20 cm.\n\nNext, we can calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -20/20 = -1\n\nThe magnification is -1, which means the image is inverted and has the same size as the object.\n\nFinally, to find the size of the image, we can use the formula:\n\nImage size = Object size × Magnification\n\nAssuming the object size is given, let's call it h:\n\nImage size = h × (-1)\n\nSince the magnification is -1, the image size will be the same as the object size but inverted."
