    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to account for approximately 27% of the mass and energy in the observable universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it extremely difficult to detect. The exact composition of dark matter is still unknown, and there are several theoretical models that attempt to describe its properties.\n\nOne of the proposed models for dark matter is the existence of dark atoms and dark molecules, which are analogous to the atoms and molecules in the observable universe but made up of dark matter particles. These dark atoms and molecules would interact with each other through a dark electromagnetic force, similar to how ordinary atoms and molecules interact through the electromagnetic force.\n\nThe predicted mass range for dark atoms and dark molecules depends on the specific model and the type of dark matter particles they are composed of. Some models propose that dark matter is made up of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are predicted to have masses in the range of 10 GeV/c^2 to a few TeV/c^2 (1 GeV/c^2 is approximately equal to 1.783 x 10^-27 kg). Other models suggest that dark matter could be composed of axions, which are much lighter particles with masses in the range of 10^-6 eV/c^2 to 1 eV/c^2.\n\nComparing these mass ranges to the mass range of known atoms and molecules in the observable universe, we can see that dark atoms and dark molecules could potentially have a wide range of masses. Ordinary atoms have masses ranging from approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg for a hydrogen atom to around 4 x 10^-25 kg for a uranium atom. Molecules can have even larger masses, depending on the number of atoms they contain.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range for dark atoms and dark molecules depends on the specific theoretical model of dark matter and the type of particles they are composed of. The mass range can vary significantly, from much lighter than ordinary atoms to much heavier, depending on the model. Further experimental and observational evidence is needed to constrain these models and provide a more accurate prediction of the mass range for dark atoms and dark molecules."
