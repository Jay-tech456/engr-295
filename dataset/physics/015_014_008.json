    "message_2": "To estimate the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-14 to 10^-7 solar masses merging at redshifts between 10^6 and 10^12, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency of gravitational waves (f) during the merger of two black holes can be approximated as:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * (M1 + M2) * pi)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes.\n\n2. The amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) can be estimated as:\n\nh = (4 * G * (M1 * M2)^(3/5) * (M1 + M2)^(-1/5)) / (c^2 * r)\n\nwhere r is the distance to the merging black holes.\n\nGiven the mass range of the PBHs, we can calculate the frequency and amplitude for the lower and upper bounds of the mass range. For simplicity, we will assume equal masses for the merging black holes (M1 = M2).\n\nFor the lower bound (10^-14 solar masses):\n\nM1 = M2 = 10^-14 * Msun\nMsun = 1.989 * 10^30 kg (solar mass)\n\nf_low = (c^3) / (G * (2 * 10^-14 * Msun) * pi)\nh_low = (4 * G * (10^-14 * Msun)^2) / (c^2 * r)\n\nFor the upper bound (10^-7 solar masses):\n\nM1 = M2 = 10^-7 * Msun\n\nf_high = (c^3) / (G * (2 * 10^-7 * Msun) * pi)\nh_high = (4 * G * (10^-7 * Msun)^2) / (c^2 * r)\n\nNow, we need to consider the redshift factor (z) for the frequency and amplitude. The frequency will be redshifted as:\n\nf_observed = f_emitted / (1 + z)\n\nThe amplitude will be affected by the luminosity distance (d_L), which is related to the comoving distance (r) and the redshift (z) as:\n\nd_L = (1 + z) * r\n\nh_observed = h_emitted * r / d_L\n\nConsidering the redshift range (10^6 to 10^12), we can calculate the observed frequency and amplitude for the lower and upper bounds of the mass range and redshift range.\n\nComparing these values to the sensitivity of current and future gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO, Virgo, and LISA, we can determine if these observatories would be able to detect the gravitational waves emitted by the merging PBHs.\n\nLIGO and Virgo are sensitive to frequencies in the range of ~10 Hz to a few kHz, while LISA is sensitive to lower frequencies in the range of ~10^-4 Hz to ~10^-1 Hz. The amplitude sensitivity for these observatories varies, but typically, they can detect strain amplitudes on the order of 10^-21 to 10^-23.\n\nGiven the wide range of masses and redshifts, a detailed calculation and comparison would be required to determine the detectability of these gravitational waves by current and future observatories. However, this rough estimation should provide a starting point for further analysis."
