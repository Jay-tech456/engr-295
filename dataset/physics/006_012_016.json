    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state).\n\nFor a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1), the formula becomes:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state, which is the absolute value of the ground state energy:\n\nIonization energy = |-13.6 eV| = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
