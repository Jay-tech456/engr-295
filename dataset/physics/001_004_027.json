    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n=1) to the n=∞ state, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nIn the ground state (n=1), the energy of the hydrogen atom is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nWhen the hydrogen atom is ionized, the electron is completely removed from the atom, which corresponds to the n=∞ state. In this case, the energy of the hydrogen atom is:\n\nE_∞ = -13.6 eV / ∞^2 = 0 eV\n\nThe energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom is the difference between the energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_∞ - E_1 = 0 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state to the n=∞ state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
