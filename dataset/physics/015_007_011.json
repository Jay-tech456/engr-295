    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted from a cosmic string network, we can use the following relation:\n\nf ~ G * μ / c^3\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, μ is the linear mass density (tension) of the cosmic string, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the tension of the cosmic string network is 10^-7 in Planck units, we can convert it to SI units using the Planck tension (T_P) as follows:\n\nT_P = (ħ * c^5) / (G^2 * M_P^2)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and M_P is the Planck mass.\n\nNow, we can find the linear mass density (tension) in SI units:\n\nμ = 10^-7 * T_P\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves can then be calculated using the relation mentioned earlier:\n\nf ~ G * μ / c^3\n\nNow, let's compare this frequency range to the sensitivity range of current gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and Virgo.\n\nLIGO's sensitivity range is approximately between 10 Hz and 5 kHz, while Virgo's sensitivity range is between 10 Hz and 10 kHz.\n\nAfter calculating the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted from the cosmic string network, we can compare it to these sensitivity ranges to determine if LIGO and Virgo can detect these waves. If the frequency falls within the sensitivity range of these detectors, then they can potentially detect the gravitational waves emitted from the cosmic string network."
