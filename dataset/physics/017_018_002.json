    "message_2": "To find the energy-level spacing of an electron in a GaAs quantum dot, we can use the formula for the energy levels of an electron in a three-dimensional spherical quantum dot (also known as a quantum sphere):\n\nE_n = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at level n, h is the Planck's constant, m_eff is the effective mass of the electron, R is the radius of the quantum dot, and n_x, n_y, and n_z are the quantum numbers corresponding to the x, y, and z directions.\n\nGiven the effective mass m_eff = 0.067 * m_e, where m_e is the mass of an electron (9.109 × 10^-31 kg), we have:\n\nm_eff = 0.067 * (9.109 × 10^-31 kg) = 6.103 × 10^-32 kg\n\nThe radius of the quantum dot is given as R = 10 nm = 10 × 10^-9 m.\n\nNow, we need to find the energy-level spacing, which is the difference in energy between two consecutive energy levels. Let's consider the two lowest energy levels, with quantum numbers (1,0,0) and (1,1,0). The energy difference between these two levels is:\n\nΔE = E_(1,1,0) - E_(1,0,0)\n\nUsing the energy formula:\n\nE_(1,1,0) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * (1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * 2\nE_(1,0,0) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * (1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * 1\n\nΔE = E_(1,1,0) - E_(1,0,0) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2)) * (2 - 1) = (h^2 / (8 * m_eff * R^2))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔE = ((6.626 × 10^-34 J s)^2 / (8 * 6.103 × 10^-32 kg * (10 × 10^-9 m)^2)) = 1.512 × 10^-20 J\n\nTo convert this energy difference to meV (milli-electron-Volt), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J:\n\nΔE = (1.512 × 10^-20 J) / (1.602 × 10^-22 eV) = 9.43 meV\n\nSo, the energy-level spacing of an electron in a GaAs quantum dot of radius 10 nm is approximately 9.43 meV."
