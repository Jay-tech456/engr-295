    "message_2": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. GRBs are classified into two types: short-duration GRBs (lasting less than 2 seconds) and long-duration GRBs (lasting more than 2 seconds). The evidence supporting the hypothesis that black holes are the source of gamma-ray bursts comes from various observations and theoretical models.\n\n1. Observational evidence: The afterglow of GRBs, which is the fading emission of light following the initial burst, has been observed in various wavelengths, including X-ray, optical, and radio. These afterglows have been found to be consistent with the emission from a relativistic jet, which is a highly collimated outflow of particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light. The formation of such jets is believed to be associated with the accretion of matter onto a black hole.\n\n2. Theoretical models: There are two leading models for the production of gamma-ray bursts, both of which involve black holes:\n\na) Collapsar model (for long-duration GRBs): In this model, a massive star (at least 20 times the mass of the Sun) undergoes core-collapse at the end of its life, forming a black hole. The outer layers of the star fall inwards, forming an accretion disk around the black hole. The intense gravitational forces and the rapid rotation of the disk generate strong magnetic fields, which in turn launch a relativistic jet along the rotation axis of the black hole. The jet penetrates through the outer layers of the star and produces gamma-ray bursts when it interacts with the surrounding medium.\n\nb) Neutron star merger model (for short-duration GRBs): In this model, two neutron stars in a binary system spiral inwards due to the emission of gravitational waves, eventually merging to form a black hole. The merger process also results in the formation of an accretion disk around the black hole, which again generates strong magnetic fields and launches a relativistic jet. The interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium produces gamma-ray bursts.\n\n3. Gravitational wave detections: The recent detections of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo observatories have provided further evidence for the connection between black holes and gamma-ray bursts. In 2017, the merger of two neutron stars was observed through both gravitational waves (GW170817) and a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A). This confirmed the association between neutron star mergers, black hole formation, and the production of gamma-ray bursts.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the hypothesis that black holes are the source of gamma-ray bursts comes from the consistency of observed afterglows with relativistic jet emission, the success of theoretical models involving black holes in explaining the production of GRBs, and the recent direct observation of a neutron star merger event associated with a gamma-ray burst."
