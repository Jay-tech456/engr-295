    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive material has a half-life of 5 hours. If the initial mass of the sample is 80 grams, what is the mass remaining after 15 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nmass_remaining = initial_mass * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere\ninitial_mass = 80 grams\nhalf_life = 5 hours\ntime_elapsed = 15 hours\n\nmass_remaining = 80 * (1/2)^(15 / 5)\nmass_remaining = 80 * (1/2)^3\nmass_remaining = 80 * (1/8)\nmass_remaining = 10 grams\n\nSo, after 15 hours, 10 grams of the radioactive material will remain."
