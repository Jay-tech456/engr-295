    "message_2": "The energy threshold of a gamma-ray telescope required to detect gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant depends on several factors, including the distance to the remnant, the age of the remnant, and the sensitivity of the telescope. Generally, gamma-ray telescopes need to be sensitive to energies in the range of 100 MeV to 100 GeV to detect emissions from supernova remnants.\n\nSupernova remnants emit gamma rays primarily through two processes: the decay of radioactive isotopes produced during the explosion (such as 56Ni and 44Ti) and the interaction of high-energy particles accelerated by the remnant's shock wave with the surrounding interstellar medium. The energy of these gamma rays can vary depending on the specific isotopes and interactions involved, but they typically fall within the aforementioned energy range.\n\nCurrent gamma-ray telescopes, such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), have sensitivities in this energy range. The Fermi LAT has an energy range of about 20 MeV to over 300 GeV, while H.E.S.S. is sensitive to energies between 100 GeV and 100 TeV. These telescopes have successfully detected gamma-ray emissions from several supernova remnants, demonstrating their ability to observe these sources.\n\nIn summary, to detect gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant, a gamma-ray telescope should have an energy threshold within the range of 100 MeV to 100 GeV. This range covers the typical energies of gamma rays produced by supernova remnants and is within the sensitivity of current gamma-ray telescopes like Fermi LAT and H.E.S.S."
