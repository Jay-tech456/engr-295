    "message_2": "To determine the work done by the gas during this process, we can use the formula for work done during an isothermal process (constant temperature):\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature.\n\nWe can use the initial conditions to find n:\n\n(1 atm) * (5 m³) = n * (0.0821 L atm / (K mol)) * (300 K)\n\nTo convert the volume from m³ to L, we multiply by 1000:\n\n(1 atm) * (5000 L) = n * (0.0821 L atm / (K mol)) * (300 K)\n\nNow we can solve for n:\n\nn = (1 atm * 5000 L) / (0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 300 K)\nn ≈ 203.4 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we need to find the final volume (Vf) using the final pressure (4 atm):\n\n(4 atm) * Vf = (203.4 mol) * (0.0821 L atm / (K mol)) * (300 K)\n\nSolving for Vf:\n\nVf = (203.4 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 300 K) / (4 atm)\nVf ≈ 1250 L\n\nNow we can find the work done using the formula for work done during an isothermal process:\n\nW = (203.4 mol) * (0.0821 L atm / (K mol)) * (300 K) * ln(1250 L / 5000 L)\nW ≈ - 203.4 mol * 0.0821 L atm / (K mol) * 300 K * ln(0.25)\nW ≈ - 203.4 * 0.0821 * 300 * (-1.386)\nW ≈ 8465.7 L atm\n\nTo convert the work done to Joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 L atm = 101.325 J:\n\nW ≈ 8465.7 L atm * (101.325 J / L atm)\nW ≈ 857,420 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during this process is approximately 857,420 Joules."
