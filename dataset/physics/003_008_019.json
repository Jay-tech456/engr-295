Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 10 cm from one of the shorter sides of the sheet, assuming the current flows in the direction away from the observer.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r from the point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point P.\n\nSince the current is uniformly distributed over the rectangular sheet, we can consider the sheet as a collection of parallel wires with a current density J (A/m). The current density J can be calculated as:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere A is the area of the sheet. In this case, the area A = 0.20 m × 0.15 m = 0.03 m². Therefore, the current density J = 4 A / 0.03 m² = 133.33 A/m².\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element dI at a distance x from the shorter side of the sheet. The width of this small element is dx, and its length is equal to the longer side of the sheet (0.20 m). The current in this small element dI can be calculated as:\n\ndI = J * dx * 0.20 m\n\nThe distance from this small current element to point P is:\n\nr = sqrt((0.10 m - x)² + 0.15²)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field dB due to this small current element at point P using the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 0.20 m * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire width of the sheet (from x = 0 to x = 0.15 m) will give us the total magnetic field at point P:\n\nB = ∫₀¹⁵ [(μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * 0.20 m * r) / r³] dx\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * ∫₀¹⁵ [(J * dx * r) / r³] dx\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * J * ∫₀¹⁵ [1 / (r²)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = r², then du = 2r dr. The integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * J * ∫ [1 / u] (du / 2)\n\nNow, we can integrate and substitute back the values of u and r:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * J * (1 / 2) * ln(u) |₀¹⁵\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * J * (1 / 2) * [ln(r²)] |₀¹⁵\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * 0.20 m * J * (1 / 2) * [ln((0.10 m - 0.15 m)² + 0.15²) - ln((0.10 m - 0 m)² + 0.15²)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of μ₀ and J:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * 0.20 m * 133.33 A/m² * (1 / 2) * [ln((0.10 m - 0.15 m)² + 0.15²) - ln((0.10 m - 0 m)² + 0.15²)]\n\nB ≈ 1.67 × 10⁻⁶ T * [ln(0.10² + 0.15²) - ln(0.15²)]\n\nB ≈ 1.67 × 10⁻⁶ T * [ln(0.025) - ln(0.0225)]\n\nB ≈ 1.67 × 10⁻⁶ T * 0.102\n\nB ≈ 1.70 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.70 × 10⁻⁷ T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the current flows in the direction away from the observer, the magnetic field at point P will be directed into the plane (toward the observer)."
