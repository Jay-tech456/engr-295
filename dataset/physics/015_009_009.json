    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we need to know the masses of the neutron stars and the distance between them. Since the masses are not provided, I will assume they are equal and denote their mass as M. The distance between the neutron stars is given as 100 km, and the period of rotation is 10 milliseconds.\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of the gravitational waves. The frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system:\n\nf_grav = 2 * f_orbital\n\nThe orbital frequency can be calculated from the period:\n\nf_orbital = 1 / T\n\nwhere T is the period, which is given as 10 milliseconds or 0.01 seconds.\n\nf_orbital = 1 / 0.01 s = 100 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nf_grav = 2 * 100 Hz = 200 Hz\n\nNext, let's find the amplitude of the gravitational waves. The amplitude of gravitational waves from a binary system can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M^2) / (c^4 * d)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of each neutron star, c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s), and d is the distance between the neutron stars (100 km or 1 × 10^5 m).\n\nSince we don't have the mass of the neutron stars, we cannot calculate the exact amplitude. However, we can express the amplitude in terms of the mass:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * M^2) / ((2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * 1 × 10^5 m)\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the square of the mass of the neutron stars.\n\nIn summary, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the binary neutron star system is 200 Hz, and the amplitude is proportional to the square of the mass of the neutron stars."
