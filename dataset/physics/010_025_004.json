    "message_2": "In a tokamak reactor, the required plasma temperature to achieve sustained fusion reactions is typically in the range of 100 to 150 million degrees Celsius (or about 10 to 15 keV in energy units). This temperature is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. Overcoming Coulomb barrier: At such high temperatures, the kinetic energy of the hydrogen isotopes (usually deuterium and tritium) in the plasma is sufficient to overcome the electrostatic repulsion (Coulomb barrier) between their positively charged nuclei. This allows the nuclei to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion.\n\n2. Maximizing reaction rate: The fusion reaction rate depends on the temperature and density of the plasma. Higher temperatures increase the likelihood of particles having enough energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier and collide with sufficient force to cause fusion. The temperature must be high enough to maximize the reaction rate and produce a self-sustaining fusion process, known as ignition.\n\n3. Achieving energy gain: For a fusion reactor to be practical, the energy output from the fusion reactions must be greater than the energy input required to heat and confine the plasma. This condition is known as the Lawson criterion. Achieving the necessary temperature is essential for meeting this criterion and ensuring a net energy gain.\n\nIn summary, the plasma temperature of 100 to 150 million degrees Celsius is crucial for achieving sustained fusion reactions in a tokamak reactor because it allows the hydrogen isotopes to overcome the Coulomb barrier, maximizes the reaction rate, and ensures a net energy gain from the fusion process."
