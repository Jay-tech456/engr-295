    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of energy required to vaporize the water, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = mass (m) × latent heat of vaporization (L)\n\nGiven:\nmass (m) = 500 grams\nlatent heat of vaporization (L) = 540 calories/gram\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nEnergy (Q) = 500 grams × 540 calories/gram\n\nEnergy (Q) = 270,000 calories\n\nSo, the amount of energy required to vaporize 500 grams of water at a constant temperature of 100°C is 270,000 calories."
