    "message_2": "MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) are a class of dark matter candidates that include objects like black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and unassociated planets. They are thought to contribute to the dark matter in our galaxy by residing in the galactic halo.\n\nThe estimated contribution of MACHOs to the total mass of dark matter in our galaxy is still uncertain, but recent studies suggest that it is likely to be a small fraction. Observations from gravitational microlensing surveys, such as the MACHO Project, EROS, and OGLE, have provided some constraints on the MACHO population. These surveys have found that MACHOs with masses between 10^-7 and 1 solar mass contribute less than 20% of the total dark matter mass in the Milky Way.\n\nOne of the key observational evidence supporting the MACHO hypothesis comes from gravitational microlensing events. When a MACHO passes between a distant star and an observer on Earth, the gravitational field of the MACHO bends the light from the star, causing a temporary increase in the star's brightness. By monitoring millions of stars, astronomers can detect these microlensing events and estimate the abundance and mass distribution of MACHOs.\n\nHowever, the number of observed microlensing events is lower than what would be expected if MACHOs made up a significant fraction of dark matter. This suggests that MACHOs are not the dominant component of dark matter in our galaxy. Instead, other forms of dark matter, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions, are considered more likely candidates to explain the majority of dark matter in the universe."
