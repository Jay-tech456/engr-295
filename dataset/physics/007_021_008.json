    "message_2": "To determine the thickness of the lead shield required to block at least 90% of the gamma rays emitted by a cobalt-60 source, we need to use the concept of half-value layer (HVL) and tenth-value layer (TVL). The HVL is the thickness of a material that reduces the intensity of the radiation to half of its initial value, while the TVL is the thickness that reduces the intensity to one-tenth of its initial value.\n\nFor gamma rays, the attenuation of intensity (I) with respect to the initial intensity (I₀) can be described by the following equation:\n\nI = I₀ * e^(-μx)\n\nwhere μ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material (in cm⁻¹) and x is the thickness of the material (in cm).\n\nTo find the TVL, we need to determine the thickness (x) that reduces the intensity to 10% of its initial value (I/I₀ = 0.1):\n\n0.1 = e^(-μx)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.1) = -μx\n\nNow, we need to find the linear attenuation coefficient (μ) for lead at the given gamma-ray energies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a database of mass attenuation coefficients for various materials and energies. For lead, the mass attenuation coefficients (μ/ρ) at 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV are approximately 0.0626 cm²/g and 0.0576 cm²/g, respectively.\n\nTo find the linear attenuation coefficient (μ), we multiply the mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ) by the density (ρ) of lead:\n\nμ(1.17 MeV) = 0.0626 cm²/g * 11.34 g/cm³ ≈ 0.710 cm⁻¹\nμ(1.33 MeV) = 0.0576 cm²/g * 11.34 g/cm³ ≈ 0.653 cm⁻¹\n\nNow, we can calculate the thickness (x) for each energy:\n\nx(1.17 MeV) = ln(0.1) / -0.710 ≈ 3.29 cm\nx(1.33 MeV) = ln(0.1) / -0.653 ≈ 3.52 cm\n\nSince we want to block at least 90% of the gamma rays at both energies, we need to choose the larger thickness value:\n\nx = 3.52 cm\n\nTherefore, a lead shield with a thickness of 3.52 cm is required to block at least 90% of the gamma rays emitted by a cobalt-60 source."
