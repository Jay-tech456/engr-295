    "message_2": "To calculate the beta function up to 2-loops for the scalar field ϕ^4 theory, we will use the renormalization group equation and dimensional regularization. The Lagrangian for the ϕ^4 theory is given by:\n\nL = 1/2 (∂μϕ)(∂^μϕ) - m^2/2 ϕ^2 - λ/4! ϕ^4\n\nwhere m is the mass, λ is the coupling constant, and ϕ is the scalar field.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the 1-loop and 2-loop corrections to the 4-point function. We will use dimensional regularization, where the spacetime dimension is D = 4 - 2ε. The 1-loop correction to the 4-point function is given by the \"sunset\" diagram, which can be calculated as:\n\nΓ^(1) = (λ^2/2) ∫(d^Dk/(2π)^D) 1/[(k^2 - m^2)((k+p1)^2 - m^2)((k+p1+p2)^2 - m^2)]\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the incoming momenta. After performing the integral, we get:\n\nΓ^(1) = (3λ^2/2(4π)^2ε) + finite terms\n\nNow, we need to calculate the 2-loop correction. The 2-loop diagrams contributing to the 4-point function are the \"double-sunset\" and \"setting-sun\" diagrams. The calculation is more involved, but the result is:\n\nΓ^(2) = (3λ^3/2(4π)^4ε^2) + finite terms\n\nNow, we can calculate the beta function using the renormalization group equation:\n\nβ(λ) = μ(dλ/dμ) = -ελ + (3λ^2/2(4π)^2) - (3λ^3/2(4π)^4ε)\n\nTo find the infrared fixed point, we set β(λ) = 0 and solve for λ:\n\n-ελ + (3λ^2/2(4π)^2) - (3λ^3/2(4π)^4ε) = 0\n\nIn the limit ε → 0, the first and last terms vanish, and we get:\n\n(3λ^2/2(4π)^2) = 0\n\nThis equation has a non-trivial solution λ* = 0, which corresponds to the infrared fixed point. This means that the ϕ^4 theory has an infrared fixed point at λ = 0, which is the free field theory."
