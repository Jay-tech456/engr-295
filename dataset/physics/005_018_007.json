    "message_2": "To find the energy of a particle in a relativistic regime, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation for a massive particle, which is given by:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nGiven the rest mass m = 2 GeV/c² and the momentum p = 4 GeV/c, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE² = ((2 GeV/c²) * c²)² + ((4 GeV/c) * c)²\n\nE² = (2 GeV)² + (4 GeV)²\n\nE² = 4 GeV² + 16 GeV²\n\nE² = 20 GeV²\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the energy E:\n\nE = √(20 GeV²)\n\nE ≈ 4.47 GeV\n\nSo, the energy of the particle is approximately 4.47 GeV."
