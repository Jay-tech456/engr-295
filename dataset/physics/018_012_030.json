    "message_2": "To determine the expected energy range of gamma rays emitted from a blazar with a redshift of z=0.6, we first need to consider the typical energy range of gamma rays emitted by blazars in their rest frame (i.e., without any redshift).\n\nBlazars typically emit gamma rays with energies ranging from around 100 MeV (million electron volts) to over 100 GeV (billion electron volts). However, due to the redshift, the observed energy of these gamma rays will be lower than their emitted energy.\n\nThe relationship between emitted and observed energies is given by the formula:\n\nE_observed = E_emitted / (1 + z)\n\nwhere E_observed is the observed energy, E_emitted is the emitted energy, and z is the redshift.\n\nFor the lower energy limit (100 MeV):\n\nE_observed = 100 MeV / (1 + 0.6) = 100 MeV / 1.6 ≈ 62.5 MeV\n\nFor the upper energy limit (100 GeV):\n\nE_observed = 100 GeV / (1 + 0.6) = 100 GeV / 1.6 ≈ 62.5 GeV\n\nSo, the expected energy range of gamma rays emitted from a blazar with a redshift of z=0.6 is approximately 62.5 MeV to 62.5 GeV."
