    "message_2": "The event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, also known as a Schwarzschild black hole, is described by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs). The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 5 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass into kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg, so:\n\nM = 5 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 9.945 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula for the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 x 10^30 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nRs â‰ˆ 1.47 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14.7 kilometers."
