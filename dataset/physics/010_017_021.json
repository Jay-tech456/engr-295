    "message_1": "A steel cylinder having a height of 1m and a diameter of 0.5m is partially filled with water. The cylinder is subjected to sinusoidal vibrations of frequency 50 Hz along its vertical axis. If the amplitude of vibration is 2 mm, determine the natural frequency of the water column inside the cylinder and the corresponding amplitude of vibrations of the water surface. (Assume the density of water to be 1000 kg/m³ and neglect surface tension effects.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the natural frequency of the water column inside the cylinder, we can use the following formula for the fundamental frequency of a liquid column:\n\nf = (1/2π) * √(g/h)\n\nwhere f is the natural frequency, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the water column.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of the water column (h). Since we are not given the volume of water in the cylinder, we cannot determine the exact height of the water column. However, we can still express the natural frequency in terms of h:\n\nf = (1/2π) * √(9.81/h)\n\nNow, we need to determine the amplitude of vibrations of the water surface. The amplitude of the water surface vibrations can be determined using the following formula:\n\nA_water = A_cylinder * (ρ_water * g * h) / (ρ_water * g * h + 2 * π * f_cylinder² * ρ_water * h)\n\nwhere A_water is the amplitude of the water surface vibrations, A_cylinder is the amplitude of the cylinder vibrations (2 mm = 0.002 m), ρ_water is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), h is the height of the water column, and f_cylinder is the frequency of the cylinder vibrations (50 Hz).\n\nSubstituting the given values and the expression for the natural frequency, we get:\n\nA_water = 0.002 * (1000 * 9.81 * h) / (1000 * 9.81 * h + 2 * π * (50)² * 1000 * h)\n\nA_water = 0.002 * (9810 * h) / (9810 * h + 15707963 * h)\n\nA_water = 0.002 * (9810 * h) / ((9810 + 15707963) * h)\n\nA_water = 0.002 * 9810 / (9810 + 15707963)\n\nA_water ≈ 0.00125 m or 1.25 mm\n\nSo, the natural frequency of the water column inside the cylinder is f = (1/2π) * √(9.81/h), and the corresponding amplitude of vibrations of the water surface is approximately 1.25 mm."
