    "message_2": "To compute the partition function of a free scalar field theory in two dimensions that is invariant under conformal transformations, we first need to define the action of the theory. The action for a free scalar field φ in two dimensions is given by the Polyakov action:\n\nS[φ] = (1/4π) ∫ d^2x √g g^(ab) ∂_a φ ∂_b φ,\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the metric tensor g^(ab), and the indices a and b run from 1 to 2.\n\nThe partition function Z is given by the path integral over all field configurations:\n\nZ = ∫ Dφ e^(-S[φ]).\n\nTo compute this partition function, we need to take into account the conformal symmetry of the theory. In two dimensions, the conformal symmetry allows us to choose the metric to be of the form g^(ab) = e^(2ω(x)) η^(ab), where η^(ab) is the flat Minkowski metric and ω(x) is a scalar function. This choice of metric simplifies the action to:\n\nS[φ] = (1/4π) ∫ d^2x (η^(ab) ∂_a φ ∂_b φ + 2ω(x) (∂ φ)^2),\n\nwhere (∂ φ)^2 = η^(ab) ∂_a φ ∂_b φ.\n\nNow, we can use the technique of functional determinants to compute the partition function. The functional determinant of the operator (∂^2 + 2ω(x) ∂^2) can be computed using zeta function regularization or heat kernel methods. The result is:\n\nlog(det(∂^2 + 2ω(x) ∂^2)) = - (1/96π) ∫ d^2x R,\n\nwhere R is the scalar curvature associated with the metric g^(ab).\n\nFinally, the partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = exp(- log(det(∂^2 + 2ω(x) ∂^2))) = exp((1/96π) ∫ d^2x R).\n\nThis is the partition function of a free scalar field theory in two dimensions that is invariant under conformal transformations. Note that the result depends only on the geometry of the space through the scalar curvature R, reflecting the conformal invariance of the theory."
