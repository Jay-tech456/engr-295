    "message_2": "To determine if there will be total internal reflection at any of the faces of the prism, we first need to find the refractive index of the glass and then calculate the critical angle for the prism-air interface.\n\nLet's assume the refractive index of the glass is n. We can use Snell's Law to find the angle of refraction (r) when the light enters the prism:\n\nn1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1), i is the angle of incidence (45 degrees), n2 is the refractive index of the glass (n), and r is the angle of refraction.\n\n1 * sin(45) = n * sin(r)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071, so:\n\n0.7071 = n * sin(r)\n\nNow, let's find the angle of deviation (D) inside the prism:\n\nD = i - r + A\n\nwhere A is the angle of the prism (60 degrees). We want to find the angle of emergence (e) when the light exits the prism:\n\ne = A - D\n\nNow, let's use Snell's Law again to find the angle of refraction (r') when the light exits the prism:\n\nn * sin(r') = 1 * sin(e)\n\nn * sin(r') = sin(e)\n\nTo determine if there will be total internal reflection, we need to find the critical angle (C) for the prism-air interface:\n\nC = arcsin(1/n)\n\nIf the angle of refraction (r') is greater than the critical angle (C), then there will be total internal reflection.\n\nLet's assume n = 1.5 (typical value for glass) and solve for the critical angle:\n\nC = arcsin(1/1.5)\n\nC ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nNow we need to find the angle of refraction (r') when the light exits the prism. We can use the equations we derived earlier:\n\n0.7071 = 1.5 * sin(r)\n\nr ≈ 28.07 degrees\n\nD = 45 - 28.07 + 60\n\nD ≈ 76.93 degrees\n\ne = 60 - 76.93\n\ne ≈ -16.93 degrees\n\nSince e is negative, it means the light is not exiting the prism and total internal reflection occurs.\n\nSo, there will be total internal reflection at one of the faces of the prism, and the critical angle for the prism-air interface is approximately 41.81 degrees."
