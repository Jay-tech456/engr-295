    "message_2": "The probability of detecting a supersymmetric particle in a collision between a proton and an anti-proton depends on various factors, including the energy level of the collision, the specific supersymmetric particles being considered, and the experimental setup used to detect them. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, which predicts the existence of supersymmetric partner particles for each known particle in the Standard Model.\n\nTo date, no supersymmetric particles have been experimentally observed, despite extensive searches at particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The lack of experimental evidence has led to increasingly stringent constraints on the possible properties and masses of supersymmetric particles.\n\nTo estimate the probability of detecting a supersymmetric particle in a proton-antiproton collision, we can consider the cross-sections for producing these particles, which are calculated using theoretical models and experimental constraints. Cross-sections represent the likelihood of a specific process occurring in a particle collision, and larger cross-sections indicate a higher probability of the process occurring.\n\nFor example, let's consider the production of a supersymmetric particle called a \"gluino\" in a proton-antiproton collision. The cross-section for gluino pair production depends on the gluino mass and the energy of the collision. The latest experimental data from the LHC has excluded gluino masses below about 2 TeV (2000 GeV), meaning that if gluinos exist, they must be heavier than this limit.\n\nAssuming a certain energy level for the proton-antiproton collision, we can use theoretical models such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) to calculate the cross-section for gluino pair production. However, as the energy of the collision increases, the cross-section for producing heavier particles generally decreases. Therefore, the probability of detecting a gluino in a proton-antiproton collision at a given energy level will be relatively small, especially if the gluino mass is close to the current experimental limits.\n\nIn summary, the probability of detecting a supersymmetric particle in a proton-antiproton collision at a certain energy level is challenging to determine precisely, as it depends on various factors and assumptions. However, based on the latest experimental data and theoretical models, the probability is likely to be relatively small, particularly for supersymmetric particles with masses close to the current experimental limits. Further experimental searches at higher energy levels and with improved detection capabilities will be crucial for determining whether supersymmetric particles exist and can be observed in proton-antiproton collisions."
