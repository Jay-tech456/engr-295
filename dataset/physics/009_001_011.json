    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90°, and sin(90°) = 1. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the refractive indices of water (n1 = 1.33) and air (n2 = 1.00):\n\n1.33 * sin(θ1) = 1.00\n\nTo find the critical angle (θ1), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.00 / 1.33\n\nsin(θ1) ≈ 0.7519\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine (arcsin) to get the critical angle:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.7519)\n\nθ1 ≈ 48.8°\n\nSo, the critical angle for total internal reflection in water when the surrounding medium is air is approximately 48.8°."
