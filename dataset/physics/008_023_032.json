    "message_2": "The properties of W and Z bosons produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and in electron-positron collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 91 GeV can be compared in terms of production cross sections, decay modes, and transverse momentum distributions.\n\n1. Production cross sections:\n\nIn proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV, the production cross sections for W and Z bosons are significantly higher than in electron-positron collisions at 91 GeV. This is because the higher center-of-mass energy in proton-proton collisions allows for a larger phase space for the production of W and Z bosons. Additionally, the strong force between quarks inside protons contributes to the production of W and Z bosons in proton-proton collisions, whereas the electromagnetic force is responsible for their production in electron-positron collisions.\n\n2. Decay modes:\n\nThe decay modes of W and Z bosons are determined by the electroweak interactions and are independent of the initial collision process. Therefore, the decay modes of W and Z bosons produced in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV and electron-positron collisions at 91 GeV are the same.\n\nW bosons can decay into a lepton and a neutrino (W -> lν) or a quark-antiquark pair (W -> q'q). The branching ratios for these decay modes are roughly the same in both collision types.\n\nZ bosons can decay into a lepton-antilepton pair (Z -> ll), a neutrino-antineutrino pair (Z -> νν), or a quark-antiquark pair (Z -> qq). The branching ratios for these decay modes are also roughly the same in both collision types.\n\n3. Transverse momentum distributions:\n\nThe transverse momentum distributions of W and Z bosons produced in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV and electron-positron collisions at 91 GeV are different due to the different initial states and collision energies.\n\nIn proton-proton collisions, the initial state consists of quarks and gluons, which carry a fraction of the proton's momentum. This results in a broad transverse momentum distribution for the produced W and Z bosons, with a tail extending to high transverse momenta.\n\nIn electron-positron collisions, the initial state consists of an electron and a positron with well-defined momenta. The produced W and Z bosons have a more constrained transverse momentum distribution, typically peaking at lower values compared to proton-proton collisions.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between W and Z boson production in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV and electron-positron collisions at 91 GeV are the production cross sections and transverse momentum distributions. The decay modes of the bosons are the same in both cases."
