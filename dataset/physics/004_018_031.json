    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift effect, we can use the formula:\n\nΔλ/λ = (ΔΦ/c^2)\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔΦ is the difference in gravitational potential, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference in gravitational potential (ΔΦ). The gravitational potential at a distance r from the center of the Earth is given by:\n\nΦ = -GM/r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the Earth (5.972 × 10^24 kg), and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nAt the surface of the Earth (radius R = 6.371 × 10^6 m), the gravitational potential is:\n\nΦ_surface = -GM/R\n\nAt a height of 50 meters above the surface, the distance from the center of the Earth is (R + 50) meters:\n\nΦ_50m = -GM/(R + 50)\n\nNow, we can find the difference in gravitational potential:\n\nΔΦ = Φ_50m - Φ_surface = -GM/(R + 50) + GM/R\n\nΔΦ = GM(1/R - 1/(R + 50))\n\nNow we can plug this into the formula for the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ/λ = (ΔΦ/c^2)\n\nΔλ = λ(ΔΦ/c^2)\n\nAssuming the initial wavelength λ is in the visible range (e.g., 500 nm), we can calculate the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (500 × 10^-9 m) * (GM(1/R - 1/(R + 50))/c^2)\n\nΔλ ≈ 1.11 × 10^-15 m\n\nThe change in wavelength due to the gravitational redshift effect is approximately 1.11 × 10^-15 meters. This is a very small change and would be difficult to detect in practice."
