    "message_2": "The application of an external magnetic field can significantly affect the transport properties of a material, including its electrical conductivity, resistivity, and thermal conductivity. The extent of these effects depends on the specific material and the temperature at which it is studied. Here, we will discuss the effects of an external magnetic field on graphene, silicon, and copper at various temperatures.\n\n1. Graphene:\nGraphene is a two-dimensional material with unique electronic properties. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the electronic states in graphene become quantized, forming Landau levels. This quantization leads to the phenomenon of quantum Hall effect, where the electrical conductivity becomes quantized and shows plateaus as a function of the magnetic field. The resistivity also becomes anisotropic, with the longitudinal resistivity showing peaks and the transverse (Hall) resistivity showing plateaus. The thermal conductivity of graphene is also affected by the magnetic field, as it is related to the electronic contribution. At low temperatures, the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing magnetic field due to the suppression of electronic states.\n\n2. Silicon:\nSilicon is a semiconductor, and its transport properties are highly sensitive to temperature. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the motion of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in silicon becomes restricted, leading to a decrease in electrical conductivity and an increase in resistivity. This effect is more pronounced at low temperatures, where the carrier mobility is higher. The thermal conductivity of silicon is mainly determined by lattice vibrations (phonons), and its dependence on the magnetic field is relatively weak. However, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity can be affected by the magnetic field, especially at low temperatures.\n\n3. Copper:\nCopper is a metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. The application of an external magnetic field affects the motion of electrons in copper, leading to the phenomenon of classical Hall effect. The electrical conductivity decreases, and the resistivity increases with increasing magnetic field strength. This effect is more pronounced at low temperatures, where the electron scattering is reduced. The thermal conductivity of copper is mainly determined by the motion of electrons, and it is also affected by the magnetic field. At low temperatures, the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing magnetic field due to the suppression of electron motion.\n\nIn summary, the application of an external magnetic field can significantly affect the transport properties of materials like graphene, silicon, and copper. The specific effects depend on the material's electronic structure and the temperature at which it is studied. Generally, the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity decrease, while the resistivity increases with increasing magnetic field strength. These effects are more pronounced at low temperatures, where the carrier mobility and scattering mechanisms are different from those at higher temperatures."
