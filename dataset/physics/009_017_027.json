    "message_2": "To determine the distance between the first and second dark fringes on the screen, we can use the single-slit diffraction formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th dark fringe, m is the order of the dark fringe (m = 1 for the first dark fringe, m = 2 for the second dark fringe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nWidth of the slit (a) = 0.2 mm = 0.2 × 10^(-3) m\nWavelength of the light (λ) = 600 nm = 600 × 10^(-9) m\nDistance between the slit and the screen (L) = 1.4 m\n\nNow, let's find the angles for the first (m = 1) and second (m = 2) dark fringes:\n\nsin(θ1) = (1 * λ) / a\nsin(θ2) = (2 * λ) / a\n\nNext, we can use the small-angle approximation (tan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ for small angles) to find the distances (y1 and y2) from the central maximum to the first and second dark fringes on the screen:\n\ny1 = L * tan(θ1) ≈ L * sin(θ1)\ny2 = L * tan(θ2) ≈ L * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, let's calculate y1 and y2:\n\ny1 = L * (1 * λ) / a = 1.4 * (600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.2 × 10^(-3))\ny1 ≈ 0.0042 m = 4.2 mm\n\ny2 = L * (2 * λ) / a = 1.4 * (2 * 600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.2 × 10^(-3))\ny2 ≈ 0.0084 m = 8.4 mm\n\nFinally, let's find the distance between the first and second dark fringes:\n\nΔy = y2 - y1 = 8.4 mm - 4.2 mm = 4.2 mm\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second dark fringes on the screen is 4.2 mm."
