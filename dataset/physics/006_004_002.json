    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting and shifting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. The quantitative relationship between the strength of an electric field (E) and the shift in energy levels can be derived from the perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.\n\nFor a simple hydrogen-like atom, the first-order perturbation in energy due to the Stark effect can be given by:\n\nΔE = e * E * Δz\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), E is the strength of the electric field, and Δz is the change in the z-component of the electron's position.\n\nFor higher-order perturbations and more complex atoms, the relationship becomes more complicated and depends on the specific atomic structure and quantum numbers. In general, the Stark effect can be classified into linear and quadratic Stark effects.\n\n1. Linear Stark effect: The energy shift is linearly proportional to the electric field strength. This occurs when the atom or molecule has a non-zero electric dipole moment. The energy shift can be written as:\n\nΔE = μ * E\n\nwhere μ is the electric dipole moment of the atom or molecule.\n\n2. Quadratic Stark effect: The energy shift is proportional to the square of the electric field strength. This occurs when the atom or molecule has a zero electric dipole moment. The energy shift can be written as:\n\nΔE = -α * E^2 / 2\n\nwhere α is the polarizability of the atom or molecule.\n\nIn summary, the quantitative relationship between the strength of an electric field and the shift in energy levels observed in atoms due to the Stark effect depends on the specific atomic structure and can be described by either a linear or quadratic relationship."
