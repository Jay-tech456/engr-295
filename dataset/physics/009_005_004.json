    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula for a concave mirror.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification formula for a concave mirror is given by:\n\nM = -v/u = h'/h\n\nwhere M is the magnification, h' is the height of the image, and h is the height of the object.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 20 cm) and the height of the object (h = 5 cm). We need to find the distance between the screen and the mirror, which is the image distance (v).\n\nFirst, let's find the magnification (M) using the given information. Since the image is projected onto a screen, it is a real image, and the magnification will be positive. Therefore, we can write the magnification formula as:\n\nM = v/u = h'/h\n\nWe are given the height of the object (h = 5 cm) and the height of the image (h' = 5 cm, since the image is the same size as the object). Therefore, the magnification is:\n\nM = 5/5 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWe know the focal length (f = 20 cm) and the magnification (M = 1). We can rewrite the magnification formula as:\n\nv = u\n\nNow, substitute this into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/u + 1/u\n\nCombine the terms on the right side:\n\n1/20 = 2/u\n\nNow, solve for u:\n\nu = 2 * 20 = 40 cm\n\nSince the magnification is 1, the image distance (v) is equal to the object distance (u):\n\nv = u = 40 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the screen and the mirror is 40 cm."
