    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of copper if 50 g of it is heated by 100 J of energy and its temperature increases by 10°C?",
    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed or released (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nQ = 100 J (heat energy)\nm = 50 g (mass of copper)\nΔT = 10°C (change in temperature)\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c) of copper. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nc = 100 J / (50 g × 10°C)\nc = 100 J / 500 g°C\nc = 0.2 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of copper is 0.2 J/g°C."
