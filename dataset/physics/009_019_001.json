    "message_1": "In the Young's double-slit experiment, a laser emits light with a wavelength of 650 nm through two slits that are 0.025 mm apart. The resulting interference pattern on the screen is measured to be 2.2 cm between adjacent bright fringes. What is the distance between the screen and the slits?",
    "message_2": "In the Young's double-slit experiment, the distance between adjacent bright fringes (Δy) on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔy = (λ * L) / d\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nλ = 650 nm = 650 * 10^(-9) m (converting to meters)\nd = 0.025 mm = 0.025 * 10^(-3) m (converting to meters)\nΔy = 2.2 cm = 2.2 * 10^(-2) m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for L:\n\nL = (Δy * d) / λ\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL = (2.2 * 10^(-2) m * 0.025 * 10^(-3) m) / (650 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nL ≈ 0.846 m\n\nSo, the distance between the screen and the slits is approximately 0.846 meters or 84.6 cm."
