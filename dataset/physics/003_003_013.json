    "message_1": "A toroidal coil has a radius of 5 cm, a cross-sectional area of 4 cm² and 400 turns. If it carries a current of 5 A, what is the magnetic field in the core of the coil?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field in the core of the toroidal coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\nFor a toroidal coil, the magnetic field is given by the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), N is the number of turns, I is the current, and R is the radius of the toroid.\n\nGiven the values:\nN = 400 turns\nI = 5 A\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 400 * 5) / (2 * π * 0.05)\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁶ Tm * 5) / 0.1\n\nB = (40π × 10⁻⁶ T) / 0.1\n\nB ≈ 0.012566 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field in the core of the toroidal coil is approximately 0.012566 Tesla."
