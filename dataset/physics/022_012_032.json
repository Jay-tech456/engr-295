    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as clusters and superclusters of galaxies. It is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (baryonic matter) constitutes only about 5%. The remaining 68% is attributed to dark energy.\n\nThe contribution of dark matter to the formation of large-scale structures can be understood through the process of gravitational collapse. Dark matter, being non-baryonic and non-luminous, does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact gravitationally with other matter. As a result, dark matter forms a cosmic web-like structure that serves as a scaffold for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nIn the early universe, small fluctuations in the density of dark matter led to the formation of dark matter halos. These halos attracted baryonic matter, which eventually collapsed under gravity to form stars and galaxies. The gravitational pull of dark matter also facilitated the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters, shaping the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe presence of dark matter has several implications for our understanding of cosmology:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies indicate that the mass distribution in galaxies is not consistent with the distribution of visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which provides additional gravitational force to hold galaxies together.\n\n2. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides valuable information about the early universe. The observed fluctuations in the CMB temperature are consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the formation of structures in the universe.\n\n3. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be better understood by considering the role of dark matter in their formation. Dark matter provides the necessary gravitational force to bind these structures together and helps explain their observed distribution.\n\n4. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to infer the presence of dark matter. Observations of gravitational lensing provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and its role in the formation of large-scale structures.\n\nIn conclusion, dark matter plays a vital role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, including clusters and superclusters of galaxies. Its presence has significant implications for our understanding of cosmology, as it helps explain various observed phenomena, such as galaxy rotation curves, CMB radiation fluctuations, large-scale structure formation, and gravitational lensing."
