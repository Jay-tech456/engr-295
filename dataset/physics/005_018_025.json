    "message_2": "The Dirac equation for a free particle with mass m is given by:\n\n(iħ∂_t - cα·∇ - mc²β)ψ = 0\n\nwhere ψ is the four-component Dirac spinor, α and β are the Dirac matrices, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and t is time.\n\nNow, if we consider a massless particle (m = 0), the Dirac equation simplifies to:\n\n(iħ∂_t - cα·∇)ψ = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the plane wave ansatz:\n\nψ(x) = u(p)e^(-ip·x/ħ)\n\nwhere x is the spacetime four-vector (ct, x, y, z), p is the four-momentum (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z), and u(p) is a constant spinor.\n\nSubstituting the ansatz into the simplified Dirac equation, we get:\n\n(-ip_t - cα·p)u(p) = 0\n\nSince the particle is massless, its energy-momentum relation is given by:\n\nE = cp\n\nwhere E is the energy and p is the magnitude of the momentum vector. Therefore, p_t = E/c.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(-iE + cα·p)u(p) = 0\n\nTo find the solutions for u(p), we can consider the eigenvalue problem:\n\ncα·p u(p) = λu(p)\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue. The eigenvalues of the α matrices are ±1, so we have two possible values for λ: ±E.\n\nFor λ = E, the equation becomes:\n\n(cα·p - E)u(p) = 0\n\nFor λ = -E, the equation becomes:\n\n(cα·p + E)u(p) = 0\n\nThese equations have nontrivial solutions for u(p) if their determinants are zero. Solving these equations will give us the components of the spinor u(p) in terms of the momentum components p_x, p_y, and p_z.\n\nFinally, the general solution to the massless Dirac equation is a linear combination of the plane wave solutions with the spinors u(p) found above:\n\nψ(x) = ∑_s ∫ d³p [a_s(p)u_s(p)e^(-ip·x/ħ) + b_s(p)v_s(p)e^(ip·x/ħ)]\n\nwhere s labels the different spin states, a_s(p) and b_s(p) are complex coefficients, and v_s(p) are the corresponding spinors for the antiparticle solutions."
