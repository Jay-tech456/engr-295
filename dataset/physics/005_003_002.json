    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the probe relative to Earth, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth, v2 is the velocity of the probe relative to the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.8c and v2 = -0.6c (negative because the probe is traveling in the opposite direction relative to the spaceship).\n\nv = (0.8c - 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * -0.6c) / c^2)\n\nv = (0.2c) / (1 - 0.48)\n\nv = (0.2c) / 0.52\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.3846c\n\nSo, the velocity of the probe relative to Earth is approximately 0.3846c."
