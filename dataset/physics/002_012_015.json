    "message_2": "To find the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion, we can use the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\n\nwhere W is the work done, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.\n\nWe are given n = 0.25 mol, T = 300 K, and the initial pressure (Pi) = 2.0 atm. We also know that the final volume (Vf) is twice the initial volume (Vi). \n\nFirst, we need to find the initial volume (Vi). We can use the ideal gas law equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nSolving for Vi, we get:\n\nVi = nRT / Pi\n\nBefore we plug in the values, we need to convert the pressure from atm to Pa (Pascals) since the gas constant R is in J/(mol·K). \n\n1 atm = 101325 Pa\n\nPi = 2.0 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 203650 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nVi = (0.25 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K) / 203650 Pa\nVi ≈ 0.00307 m³\n\nSince the final volume is twice the initial volume:\n\nVf = 2 * Vi = 2 * 0.00307 m³ ≈ 0.00614 m³\n\nNow we can find the work done using the formula:\n\nW = nRT * ln(Vf / Vi)\nW = 0.25 mol * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 300 K * ln(0.00614 m³ / 0.00307 m³)\nW ≈ 616.05 J\n\nSo, the work done by the gas during the isothermal expansion is approximately 616.05 J."
