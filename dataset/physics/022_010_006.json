    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter affects the fluctuations in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed by the Planck satellite in several ways. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it does interact gravitationally, and its presence can be inferred through its effects on the distribution and motion of visible matter, as well as on the CMB.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is the remnant radiation from the early universe, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. At this time, the universe had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms, allowing photons to travel freely through space. These photons, which have been stretched to microwave wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe, form the CMB that we observe today.\n\nDark matter affects the fluctuations in the CMB through its influence on the formation of cosmic structures. The distribution of dark matter in the early universe played a crucial role in the formation of the first galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter's gravitational influence caused overdense regions to collapse and form structures, while underdense regions expanded and became voids.\n\nThe CMB fluctuations observed by the Planck satellite can be characterized by their power spectrum, which shows the amplitude of temperature fluctuations as a function of their angular scale on the sky. The power spectrum of the CMB contains several peaks, known as acoustic peaks, which are related to the oscillations of the photon-baryon fluid in the early universe. The presence of dark matter affects these oscillations and, consequently, the positions and amplitudes of the acoustic peaks.\n\nDark matter influences the CMB fluctuations in the following ways:\n\n1. Gravitational potential: Dark matter contributes to the total gravitational potential of the universe. This affects the motion of photons and baryons in the early universe, altering the oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and the resulting CMB fluctuations.\n\n2. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO): The presence of dark matter affects the BAO, which are the oscillations of the photon-baryon fluid caused by the competition between radiation pressure and gravitational attraction. The BAO leave imprints on the CMB power spectrum and can be used to probe the distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\n3. Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect: The ISW effect occurs when CMB photons travel through time-varying gravitational potentials, causing a change in their energy. The presence of dark matter affects the distribution of matter in the universe and, therefore, the gravitational potentials that CMB photons experience.\n\nBy analyzing the CMB fluctuations observed by the Planck satellite, physicists can gain insights into the properties and distribution of dark matter in the universe. For example, the amplitude of the CMB fluctuations can be used to estimate the total amount of dark matter, while the positions of the acoustic peaks can provide information about the dark matter's clustering properties. Additionally, the ISW effect can be used to study the distribution of dark matter on large scales and its influence on the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter has a significant impact on the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation observed by the Planck satellite. By studying these fluctuations, physicists can gain valuable insights into the properties and distribution of dark matter in the universe, helping to unravel the mysteries of this elusive form of matter."
