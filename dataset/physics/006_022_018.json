    "message_2": "To calculate the stopping power of plastic for alpha particles with an energy of 5 MeV, we can use the Bethe formula for the stopping power of charged particles in matter. The Bethe formula is given by:\n\nS = (4πe⁴z²)/(m_ev²) * (NZ/A) * ln(2m_ev²γ²β²/I) - (β²)\n\nwhere:\nS is the stopping power\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)\nz is the charge of the alpha particle (z = 2 for alpha particles)\nm_e is the mass of an electron (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nv is the velocity of the alpha particle\nN is the number density of atoms in the material\nZ is the atomic number of the material\nA is the atomic mass of the material\nγ is the Lorentz factor (γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²))\nβ is the velocity of the alpha particle divided by the speed of light (β = v/c)\nI is the mean excitation energy of the material\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity of the alpha particle. We can use the following relation between kinetic energy (E) and velocity:\n\nE = 0.5 * m * v²\n\nwhere m is the mass of the alpha particle (6.644 × 10^(-27) kg for helium-4 nucleus) and E is the kinetic energy (5 MeV = 5 × 10^6 eV = 5 × 10^6 × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J).\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * E / m) ≈ 1.565 × 10^7 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the number density of atoms (N) in the plastic. We can use the following formula:\n\nN = (ρ * N_A) / A\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the plastic (1.2 g/cm³ = 1.2 × 10^3 kg/m³), N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^(23) atoms/mol), and A is the atomic mass of the plastic.\n\nTo find the atomic mass of the plastic, we can use the weight percentages of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen:\n\nA_plastic = 0.136 * A_H + 0.815 * A_C + 0.049 * A_O\nA_plastic = 0.136 * 1 + 0.815 * 12 + 0.049 * 16 ≈ 10.26 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number density of atoms in the plastic:\n\nN = (1.2 × 10^3 * 6.022 × 10^(23)) / (10.26 × 10^(-3)) ≈ 7.05 × 10^(26) atoms/m³\n\nNext, we need to find the mean excitation energy (I) of the plastic. We can use the following empirical formula:\n\nI = 10 * Z eV\n\nwhere Z is the average atomic number of the plastic:\n\nZ_plastic = 0.136 * Z_H + 0.815 * Z_C + 0.049 * Z_O\nZ_plastic = 0.136 * 1 + 0.815 * 6 + 0.049 * 8 ≈ 5.13\n\nNow, we can find the mean excitation energy:\n\nI = 10 * 5.13 ≈ 51.3 eV = 51.3 × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the stopping power using the Bethe formula:\n\nβ = v/c ≈ 1.565 × 10^7 / 3 × 10^8 ≈ 0.0522\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²) ≈ 1.0014\n\nS = (4π × (1.602 × 10^(-19))^4 × 2^2) / (9.109 × 10^(-31) × (1.565 × 10^7)^2) * (7.05 × 10^(26) × 5.13 / 10.26) * ln(2 × 9.109 × 10^(-31) × (1.565 × 10^7)^2 × 1.0014^2 × 0.0522^2 / (51.3 × 1.602 × 10^(-19))) - (0.0522^2)\n\nS ≈ 1.23 × 10^(-15) J/m\n\nThe stopping power of plastic for alpha particles with an energy of 5 MeV is approximately 1.23 × 10^(-15) J/m."
