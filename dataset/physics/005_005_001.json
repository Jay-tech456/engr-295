    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the time dilation formula from the theory of general relativity, which states that:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - (2GM/c²R))\n\nWhere:\nΔt is the time experienced by an observer far away from the massive object (in this case, Earth)\nΔt0 is the proper time experienced by the observer close to the massive object (in this case, Sara on the spaceship)\nG is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\nM is the mass of the black hole\nc is the speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s)\nR is the distance from the center of the black hole to the spaceship\n\nWe are given that the time on the spaceship appears to be slowed down by a factor of 3. This means that:\n\nΔt = 3Δt0\n\nWe are also given that the gravitational field strength is 2000 G. The gravitational field strength (g) can be calculated as:\n\ng = GM/R²\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the distance R:\n\nR = √(GM/g)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values and constants into the equation:\n\nR = √((6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * M) / (2000 * 9.81 m/s²))\nR = √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for R back into the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n\nSince we are looking for the time that passes on Earth for every hour spent on the spaceship, we can set Δt0 = 1 hour:\n\nΔt = 1 hour / √(1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n\nWe are given that the time dilation factor is 3, so we can set Δt = 3Δt0:\n\n3Δt0 = 1 hour / √(1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n\nSince Δt0 = 1 hour, we can simplify the equation:\n\n3 = 1 / √(1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n\nNow, we can solve for the mass of the black hole (M):\n\n3² = 1 / (1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n9 = 1 / (1 - (2GM/c² * √(6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ M / 19620)))\n\nHowever, without more information about the mass of the black hole (M), we cannot solve this equation further. If we were given the mass of the black hole, we could then find the exact amount of time that passes on Earth for every hour spent on the spaceship."
