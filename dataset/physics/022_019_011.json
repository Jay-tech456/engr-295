    "message_2": "The gravitino is a hypothetical supersymmetric partner of the graviton, which is the particle responsible for the gravitational force. If dark matter is composed of gravitinos, their mass would be related to the scale of supersymmetry breaking. The current lower limits on the mass of supersymmetric particles are in the range of a few hundred GeV to a few TeV, depending on the specific particle and experimental constraints.\n\nHowever, the mass of the gravitino is not directly constrained by these lower limits, as it is determined by the supersymmetry breaking scale and the Planck scale. In scenarios where gravitinos make up dark matter, their mass is typically expected to be in the range of a few keV to a few GeV. This is because lighter gravitinos (with masses less than a few keV) would be too warm to account for the observed structure formation in the universe, while heavier gravitinos (with masses greater than a few GeV) would overclose the universe or lead to other cosmological problems.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact mass of the gravitino, as well as its role in dark matter, is still an open question in theoretical physics, and more experimental data is needed to confirm or refute this possibility."
