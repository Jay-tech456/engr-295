    "message_2": "The minimum temperature required to achieve nuclear fusion in a plasma consisting of deuterium and tritium is approximately 100 million Kelvin (100 MK or 100 million degrees Celsius). This high temperature is necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei, allowing them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and cause fusion.\n\nThe temperature has a significant effect on the rate of fusion reactions. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases, which leads to a higher probability of particles overcoming the electrostatic repulsion and undergoing fusion. The fusion reaction rate is proportional to the temperature raised to a power, typically between 2 and 4, depending on the specific reaction. For the deuterium-tritium fusion, the reaction rate is roughly proportional to T^2, where T is the temperature. This means that even a small increase in temperature can lead to a significant increase in the rate of fusion reactions."
