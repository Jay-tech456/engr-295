    "message_1": "What is the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system with masses of 10 solar masses and 15 solar masses, respectively, during the inspiral phase? Assume that the two black holes are non-spinning and that they are located at a distance of 1 billion light-years away from Earth. Given the interference pattern produced by a Michelson interferometer, what would be the amplitude of gravitational waves detected on Earth?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system during the inspiral phase, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / c⁴\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational wave, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), M is the total mass of the binary system in kilograms, ω is the angular frequency of the binary system in radians per second, r is the distance from the binary system to the observer in meters, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 10 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 15 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 2.984 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe total mass of the binary system is M = M1 + M2 = 1.989 x 10^31 kg + 2.984 x 10^31 kg = 4.973 x 10^31 kg.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the angular frequency ω. For a binary system in the inspiral phase, the angular frequency can be approximated as:\n\nω = (G * M / a³)^(1/2)\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the binary system. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to calculate the semi-major axis a. Therefore, we cannot calculate the angular frequency ω and the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system.\n\nHowever, if we were able to calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system, we could then determine the amplitude of the gravitational waves detected on Earth using a Michelson interferometer. The amplitude of the detected gravitational waves would depend on the orientation of the binary system relative to the interferometer and the sensitivity of the interferometer. In general, the amplitude of the detected gravitational waves would be smaller than the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system due to the distance between the system and the Earth and the sensitivity of the interferometer."
