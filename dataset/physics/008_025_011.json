    "message_2": "The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Its various decay modes are essential for understanding its properties and verifying the predictions of the Standard Model.\n\nThe main decay modes of the Higgs boson are:\n\n1. Higgs to bottom quarks (H -> bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%. It is challenging to detect due to the large background of bottom quarks produced in other processes at the LHC.\n\n2. Higgs to W bosons (H -> WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. One or both W bosons can further decay into leptons or quarks, providing different final states for detection.\n\n3. Higgs to tau leptons (H -> ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%. It is an important channel for studying the Higgs boson's coupling to leptons.\n\n4. Higgs to Z bosons (H -> ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%. Like the H -> WW decay, the Z bosons can decay into leptons or quarks, providing different final states for detection.\n\n5. Higgs to charm quarks (H -> cc): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.9%. It is challenging to detect due to the large background of charm quarks produced in other processes at the LHC.\n\n6. Higgs to gluons (H -> gg): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 8.6%. It is an important channel for studying the Higgs boson's coupling to the strong force.\n\n7. Higgs to photons (H -> γγ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%. It is a rare but clean channel, with a distinct experimental signature that played a crucial role in the Higgs boson's discovery.\n\n8. Higgs to muons (H -> μμ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.02%. It is a rare channel but provides a clean signature for studying the Higgs boson's coupling to second-generation leptons.\n\nThe different decay modes affect the measurement of the Higgs boson's properties in several ways:\n\n1. Detection efficiency: Some decay modes are easier to detect than others due to their distinct experimental signatures and lower background rates. This affects the precision of the measured properties.\n\n2. Couplings: The decay rates of the Higgs boson to various particles are proportional to the square of their masses. By measuring the branching ratios of different decay modes, physicists can test the Higgs mechanism's predictions and probe for deviations from the Standard Model.\n\n3. Rare decays: Some decay modes are rare but can provide crucial information about the Higgs boson's properties and potential new physics. For example, the H -> γγ decay played a significant role in the discovery of the Higgs boson, despite its low branching ratio.\n\nIn summary, the different decay modes of the Higgs boson are essential for understanding its properties and testing the predictions of the Standard Model. Each decay mode provides unique information, and their combined study allows for a comprehensive understanding of the Higgs boson and its role in the universe."
