    "message_2": "The maximum entropy that can be contained within a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:\n\nS = (kc^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nwhere S is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, A is the surface area of the black hole's event horizon, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe surface area A of the event horizon is given by:\n\nA = 4 * π * (2 * G * M / c^2)^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole.\n\nTo find the temperature of the black hole, we can use the Hawking temperature formula:\n\nT = (ħ * c^3) / (8 * π * G * M * k)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, and the other variables are as previously defined.\n\nThe maximum entropy and corresponding temperature depend on the mass of the black hole. As the mass of the black hole increases, the entropy increases, and the temperature decreases."
