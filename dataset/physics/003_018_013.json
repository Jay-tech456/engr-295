    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m away from the helix axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/meter), and I is the current (A).\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nn = 50 turns/meter\nI = 10 A\n\nFirst, let's calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB_inside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (50 turns/m) * (10 A)\nB_inside ≈ 6.28 × 10^(-5) T\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m away from the helix axis. Since the point is outside the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field outside an infinitely long solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (μ₀ * n * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the solenoid, x is the distance from the solenoid axis, and B_outside is the magnetic field outside the solenoid.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.2 m\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field outside the solenoid:\n\nB_outside = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (50 turns/m) * (10 A) * (0.1 m)^2 / (2 * (0.1 m^2 + 0.2 m^2)^(3/2))\nB_outside ≈ 1.256 × 10^(-5) T\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 0.2 m away from the helix axis is approximately 1.256 × 10^(-5) T."
