    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tau lepton decaying into an electron or muon, we need to consider the decay modes of the tau lepton and their respective branching ratios. A tau lepton can decay into various particles, but the most relevant decay modes for this problem are:\n\n1. Tau lepton decaying into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a tau neutrino.\n2. Tau lepton decaying into a muon, a muon antineutrino, and a tau neutrino.\n\nThe branching ratios for these decay modes are approximately:\n\n1. Tau -> electron + electron antineutrino + tau neutrino: 17.8%\n2. Tau -> muon + muon antineutrino + tau neutrino: 17.4%\n\nThe probability of a tau lepton decaying into an electron or muon is the sum of the branching ratios of these two decay modes:\n\nP(tau -> electron or muon) = 17.8% + 17.4% = 35.2%\n\nNow, to calculate the energy of the electron or muon produced in the decay, we need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum in the decay process. In general, the energy of the decay products depends on the specific kinematics of the decay, which can be quite complicated.\n\nHowever, we can estimate the average energy of the electron or muon by considering the mass of the tau lepton and the mass of the electron or muon. The mass of the tau lepton is approximately 1.777 GeV, while the masses of the electron and muon are approximately 0.0005 GeV and 0.106 GeV, respectively.\n\nSince the decay products share the energy of the tau lepton, the energy of the electron or muon will be less than the mass of the tau lepton. The exact energy distribution of the decay products depends on the specific decay kinematics and the masses of the other particles involved (neutrinos). However, we can expect that the energy of the electron or muon will be on the order of a few hundred MeV to around 1 GeV, depending on the specific decay event.\n\nIn summary, the probability of a tau lepton decaying into an electron or muon is approximately 35.2%, and the energy of the electron or muon produced in the decay is expected to be on the order of a few hundred MeV to around 1 GeV."
