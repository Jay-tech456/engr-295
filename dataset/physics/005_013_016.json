    "message_1": "A particle with a rest mass of 2 kg and a speed of 0.8c collides head-on with another particle of the same mass and speed in the opposite direction. What is the total energy released in the collision according to the theory of Special Relativity?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total energy released in the collision, we first need to find the relativistic mass and energy of each particle. The relativistic mass (m) can be found using the equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor both particles, m0 = 2 kg and v = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nm = 2 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nm = 2 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nm = 2 / sqrt(0.36)\nm = 2 / 0.6\nm ≈ 3.333 kg\n\nNow that we have the relativistic mass, we can find the relativistic energy (E) using the equation:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nFor both particles, m ≈ 3.333 kg and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nE ≈ 3.333 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE ≈ 3 x 10^17 J\n\nSince there are two particles, the total energy released in the collision is:\n\nTotal energy = 2 * E\nTotal energy ≈ 2 * 3 x 10^17 J\nTotal energy ≈ 6 x 10^17 J\n\nSo, the total energy released in the collision is approximately 6 x 10^17 Joules."
