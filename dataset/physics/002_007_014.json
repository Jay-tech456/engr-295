    "message_1": "A physics student needs to determine the heat capacity of a given substance. The substance is heated from an initial temperature of 25°C to a final temperature of 100°C with a heat energy input of 500J. What is the specific heat capacity of the substance?",
    "message_2": "To determine the specific heat capacity of the substance, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy input (500 J), m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T_final - T_initial = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the specific heat capacity (c):\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nHowever, we don't have the mass (m) of the substance. We need more information to determine the specific heat capacity. If the mass is provided, we can plug it into the formula and solve for c."
