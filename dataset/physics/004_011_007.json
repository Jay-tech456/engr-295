    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole. The metric is given by the following expression in Schwarzschild coordinates (t, r, θ, φ):\n\nds² = -f(r) dt² + f(r)⁻¹ dr² + r² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²),\n\nwhere\n\nf(r) = 1 - 2GM/c²r + GQ²/c⁴r².\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light, and Q is the electric charge of the black hole.\n\nThe properties of the event horizon and singularity are affected by the value of the charge Q. There are three possible scenarios depending on the relationship between M and Q:\n\n1. M² > Q² (charged black hole): In this case, there are two distinct event horizons, an outer event horizon (r+) and an inner event horizon (r-), given by:\n\nr± = GM/c² ± sqrt((GM/c²)² - GQ²/c⁴).\n\nThe outer event horizon is similar to the Schwarzschild event horizon, while the inner event horizon is a Cauchy horizon. The singularity at r = 0 is a timelike singularity, which means that it is avoidable by an infalling observer.\n\n2. M² = Q² (extremal black hole): In this case, there is only one event horizon, which coincides with the Cauchy horizon:\n\nr± = GM/c².\n\nThe singularity at r = 0 is still a timelike singularity, but the event horizon has some unique properties, such as zero surface gravity and infinite redshift.\n\n3. M² < Q² (naked singularity): In this case, there are no event horizons, and the singularity at r = 0 is exposed to the external universe. This scenario is considered unphysical, as it violates the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which states that singularities should always be hidden behind event horizons.\n\nIn summary, the value of the charge Q affects the properties of the event horizon and singularity in the Reissner-Nordström metric, leading to different types of black holes or even naked singularities."
