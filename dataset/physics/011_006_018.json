    "message_2": "In a graphene sheet, the electronic conductivity is closely related to the Fermi level. Graphene is a two-dimensional material with a honeycomb lattice structure, and its electronic properties are dominated by its unique band structure. At the Fermi level, the valence and conduction bands touch each other, forming a Dirac cone.\n\nThe Fermi level in graphene can be tuned by applying an external electric field, chemical doping, or strain. When the Fermi level is at the Dirac point (i.e., the charge neutrality point), the electronic conductivity is minimal because there are no available states for electrons to move. As the Fermi level moves away from the Dirac point, either into the valence or conduction band, the electronic conductivity increases due to the increased availability of electronic states for charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move.\n\nChanging the Fermi level in a graphene sheet affects its electronic transport properties in several ways:\n\n1. Carrier type: When the Fermi level is shifted into the conduction band, the charge carriers are electrons, and when it is shifted into the valence band, the charge carriers are holes.\n\n2. Carrier concentration: The further the Fermi level is from the Dirac point, the higher the carrier concentration, which leads to higher electronic conductivity.\n\n3. Mobility: The mobility of charge carriers in graphene is generally high due to its low effective mass and the absence of scattering centers. However, the mobility can be affected by impurities, defects, and substrate interactions, which can also influence the Fermi level.\n\n4. Quantum Hall effect: At low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the electronic transport properties of graphene exhibit the quantum Hall effect, where the Hall conductivity is quantized in units of the conductance quantum. The quantization depends on the Fermi level, and the plateaus in the Hall conductivity can be tuned by changing the Fermi level.\n\nIn summary, the electronic conductivity in a graphene sheet is closely related to the Fermi level, and changing the Fermi level can significantly affect the electronic transport properties of graphene. This tunability makes graphene a promising material for various electronic and optoelectronic applications."
