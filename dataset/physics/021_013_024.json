    "message_2": "Black holes can affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in several ways. The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, which has been redshifted to microwave wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe. It provides crucial information about the early universe and the formation of cosmic structures.\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: Black holes have immense gravitational fields that can bend the path of light passing near them. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, can cause the CMB radiation to be distorted as it passes through the vicinity of a black hole. Theoretical models predict that the lensing effect of black holes on the CMB can create small-scale anisotropies, which can be observed as temperature fluctuations in the CMB.\n\nObservational evidence: High-resolution CMB experiments, such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), have detected these small-scale anisotropies in the CMB. By analyzing the statistical properties of these anisotropies, researchers can infer the presence of black holes and other massive objects in the universe.\n\n2. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect: When CMB photons pass through a region containing hot electrons, such as the accretion disk around a black hole, they can gain energy through inverse Compton scattering. This process, known as the SZ effect, can cause a distortion in the CMB spectrum, creating a small decrement in the CMB temperature at specific frequencies.\n\nObservational evidence: Observations of galaxy clusters, which often host supermassive black holes at their centers, have revealed the SZ effect in the CMB. By studying the SZ effect, astronomers can learn about the properties of black holes and their surrounding environments.\n\nUnderstanding the effects of black holes on the CMB can help us learn more about the nature of black holes, their formation, and their role in the evolution of cosmic structures. Additionally, studying the lensing and SZ effects can provide valuable information about the distribution of matter in the universe, the properties of dark matter, and the expansion history of the universe."
