    "message_2": "The formula for the energy levels of a Rydberg atom is given by:\n\nE_n = -R_H * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at the nth energy level, R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 13.6 eV), Z is the atomic number of the element, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor a Rydberg atom, Z = 1, as it is a hydrogen-like atom. Given the principal quantum number n = 50, we can calculate the energy level as follows:\n\nE_50 = -R_H * (1^2 / 50^2)\nE_50 = -13.6 * (1 / 2500)\nE_50 = -0.00544 eV\n\nThe expected energy level of a Rydberg atom with principal quantum number 50 is approximately -0.00544 eV."
