    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that could potentially make up a portion of dark matter. However, their existence has not been confirmed, and their contribution to the universe's mass is still uncertain. \n\nAccording to the latest data from the Planck satellite mission (2018), the composition of the universe is approximately:\n\n- 68.3% dark energy\n- 26.8% dark matter\n- 4.9% ordinary (baryonic) matter\n\nThe percentage of dark matter that could be composed of sterile neutrinos is still a matter of ongoing research and debate. Some studies suggest that sterile neutrinos could make up a small fraction of the dark matter, while others argue that they might not contribute significantly to the overall mass of the universe.\n\nFor example, a study by Boyarsky et al. (2019) suggests that sterile neutrinos could make up around 3.5% of the dark matter. If we assume this value, we can calculate the percentage of the universe's mass composed of sterile neutrinos as follows:\n\nPercentage of sterile neutrinos = (Percentage of dark matter) * (Percentage of sterile neutrinos in dark matter)\nPercentage of sterile neutrinos = (26.8%) * (3.5%)\nPercentage of sterile neutrinos â‰ˆ 0.94%\n\nBased on this study, sterile neutrinos could potentially make up around 0.94% of the universe's mass. However, it's essential to note that this value is highly uncertain and could change as more data and research become available."
