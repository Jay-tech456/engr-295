    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the wire is assumed to be infinitely long, we can use Ampere's Law, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nAmpere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (5 A), and r is the distance from the wire (10 cm or 0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 10 μT\n\nSo the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the wire is 10 μT (microteslas)."
