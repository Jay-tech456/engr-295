If the final volume is 1.0 L, what is the adiabatic work done by the gas in this process? (Assume the gas is an ideal gas and the adiabatic exponent for the gas is 1.4.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the following equations and relationships for an adiabatic process:\n\n1. Adiabatic process equation: P * V^γ = constant, where P is pressure, V is volume, and γ (gamma) is the adiabatic exponent.\n2. Work done in an adiabatic process: W = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the final pressure (P2) using the adiabatic process equation. We have the initial pressure (P1) and volume (V1), the final volume (V2), and the adiabatic exponent (γ):\n\nP1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * (V1^γ / V2^γ)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nP2 = 3.0 atm * (4.0 L^1.4 / 1.0 L^1.4)\nP2 = 3.0 atm * (4.0^1.4)\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP2 ≈ 5.65 atm\n\nNow that we have the final pressure, we can calculate the work done by the gas using the second equation:\n\nW = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (γ - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nW = (3.0 atm * 4.0 L - 5.65 atm * 1.0 L) / (1.4 - 1)\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nW ≈ -3.35 J\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the work is done by the gas, meaning it has expanded and done work on its surroundings. Therefore, the adiabatic work done by the gas in this process is approximately -3.35 Joules."
