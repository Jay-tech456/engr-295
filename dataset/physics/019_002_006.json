    "message_2": "To compute the perturbative renormalization of the scalar field theory in four dimensions using the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme at the one-loop level, we first need to consider the Lagrangian of the theory. For a scalar field theory, the Lagrangian is given by:\n\nL = (1/2)(∂_μ φ)(∂^μ φ) - (1/2)m^2 φ^2 - (λ/4!)φ^4\n\nHere, φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the coupling constant. The goal of renormalization is to absorb the divergences that arise in the loop calculations into the redefinition of the parameters of the theory (mass, coupling constant, and field).\n\nAt the one-loop level, we need to compute the 1PI (one-particle irreducible) diagrams for the 2-point and 4-point functions. These diagrams are the tadpole and the sunset diagrams for the 2-point function and the \"figure-eight\" diagram for the 4-point function.\n\nFor the 2-point function, the one-loop correction to the mass is given by the tadpole diagram, which is quadratically divergent. The sunset diagram is logarithmically divergent. In the MS scheme, we subtract only the pole part of the divergences. Therefore, the renormalized mass and field are given by:\n\nm_R^2 = m^2 + δm^2\nZ = 1 + δZ\n\nwhere δm^2 is the counterterm for the mass and δZ is the counterterm for the field. In the MS scheme, the counterterms are given by:\n\nδm^2 = (λ/32π^2) Λ^2\nδZ = 0\n\nHere, Λ is the cutoff scale.\n\nFor the 4-point function, the one-loop correction to the coupling constant is given by the \"figure-eight\" diagram, which is logarithmically divergent. The renormalized coupling constant is given by:\n\nλ_R = λ + δλ\n\nwhere δλ is the counterterm for the coupling constant. In the MS scheme, the counterterm is given by:\n\nδλ = (3λ^2/16π^2) ln(Λ^2/μ^2)\n\nHere, μ is the renormalization scale.\n\nIn summary, at the one-loop level in the MS scheme, the renormalized parameters for the scalar field theory in four dimensions are given by:\n\nm_R^2 = m^2 + (λ/32π^2) Λ^2\nZ = 1\nλ_R = λ + (3λ^2/16π^2) ln(Λ^2/μ^2)"
