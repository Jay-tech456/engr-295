    "message_2": "In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the running strong coupling constant (αs) depends on the energy scale (Q) at which it is probed. The dependence of αs on the energy scale is described by the renormalization group equation, which involves the beta function (β) of QCD. For three flavors of massless quarks, the one-loop beta function is given by:\n\nβ(αs) = -b * αs^2\n\nwhere b = (33 - 2 * Nf) / (12 * π), with Nf being the number of massless quark flavors. In our case, Nf = 3, so:\n\nb = (33 - 2 * 3) / (12 * π) = 27 / (12 * π)\n\nThe renormalization group equation can be written as:\n\ndαs / d(ln(Q^2)) = β(αs)\n\nIntegrating this equation, we obtain:\n\n∫(dαs / αs^2) = -b * ∫d(ln(Q^2))\n\nLet's assume that we know the value of the strong coupling constant αs(Q0) at some reference energy scale Q0. Then, we can integrate the equation between the limits αs(Q0) and αs(Q), and ln(Q0^2) and ln(Q^2), respectively:\n\n∫[dαs / αs^2] from αs(Q0) to αs(Q) = -b * ∫d(ln(Q^2)) from ln(Q0^2) to ln(Q^2)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n[1 / αs(Q)] - [1 / αs(Q0)] = -b * (ln(Q^2) - ln(Q0^2))\n\nNow, we can solve for αs(Q):\n\n1 / αs(Q) = 1 / αs(Q0) - b * (ln(Q^2) - ln(Q0^2))\n\nαs(Q) = 1 / [1 / αs(Q0) - b * (ln(Q^2) - ln(Q0^2))]\n\nTo find the value of αs at an energy scale of 10 GeV, we need to know its value at some reference energy scale Q0. A common reference scale is the Z boson mass, Q0 ≈ 91.2 GeV, with αs(Q0) ≈ 0.118. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nαs(10 GeV) = 1 / [1 / 0.118 - (27 / (12 * π)) * (ln(10^2) - ln(91.2^2))]\n\nαs(10 GeV) ≈ 0.215\n\nSo, the value of the running strong coupling constant at an energy scale of 10 GeV in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with three flavors of massless quarks is approximately 0.215."
