    "message_2": "The decay process 𝑙𝑖→𝑙𝑗𝛾 (where 𝑙𝑖 and 𝑙𝑗 are two different charged leptons and 𝛾 is a photon) is a rare radiative lepton flavor violating (LFV) process. In the context of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, the probability of this process occurring is highly suppressed and depends on the specific model considered.\n\nOne of the most widely studied models that allow for LFV processes is the seesaw mechanism, which introduces heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. In this context, the branching ratio for the decay process 𝑙𝑖→𝑙𝑗𝛾 can be estimated as:\n\nBR(𝑙𝑖→𝑙𝑗𝛾) ≈ (𝛼/192π) (|Σ𝑘 𝑚𝑘 𝑈𝑘𝑖 𝑈*𝑘𝑗|^2) / 𝑚𝑖²\n\nwhere 𝛼 is the fine-structure constant, 𝑚𝑘 are the heavy Majorana neutrino masses, 𝑈𝑘𝑖 and 𝑈𝑘𝑗 are elements of the leptonic mixing matrix, and 𝑚𝑖 is the mass of the decaying lepton 𝑙𝑖.\n\nThe exact probability of the decay process depends on the values of the model parameters, which are not yet known. However, it is generally expected to be very small, with branching ratios on the order of 10^(-12) or smaller for typical parameter choices.\n\nThe observation of the decay process 𝑙𝑖→𝑙𝑗𝛾 would have significant implications for the principle of lepton flavor conservation. In the Standard Model of particle physics, lepton flavor is conserved, meaning that processes like 𝑙𝑖→𝑙𝑗𝛾 are forbidden. The detection of such a process would therefore be a clear indication of physics beyond the Standard Model and would provide valuable information about the nature of neutrinos and the mechanisms responsible for lepton flavor violation. In particular, it would support the Majorana nature of neutrinos and could help to constrain the parameters of the underlying theoretical model."
