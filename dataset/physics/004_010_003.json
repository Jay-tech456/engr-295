    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 5 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 9.945 × 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula to find the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = (2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (9.945 × 10^30 kg)) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ (1.327 × 10^20 kg m s^-2) / (8.988 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nRs ≈ 14.77 × 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses is approximately 14.77 kilometers."
