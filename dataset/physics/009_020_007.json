    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 4000 lines per centimeter. If a beam of monochromatic light of wavelength 550 nm is incident normally on the grating, what will be the distance between the two adjacent bright spots formed on a screen placed at a distance of 1 meter from the grating?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the angular separation of the bright spots (maxima) in a diffraction grating:\n\nsin(θ) = m * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum, λ is the wavelength of the light, and d is the distance between the lines on the grating.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance between the lines on the grating (d). We are given that there are 4000 lines per centimeter, so:\n\nd = 1 cm / 4000 lines = 1 * 10^(-2) m / 4000 lines = 2.5 * 10^(-6) m/line\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ for the first order maximum (m = 1) using the given wavelength (λ = 550 nm = 550 * 10^(-9) m):\n\nsin(θ) = m * (λ / d) = 1 * (550 * 10^(-9) m / 2.5 * 10^(-6) m/line) = 0.22\n\nθ = arcsin(0.22) ≈ 12.64°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can find the distance between the two adjacent bright spots (first order maximum) on the screen placed at a distance of 1 meter from the grating. We can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ (in radians)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ_rad = 12.64° * (π / 180) ≈ 0.2205 radians\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the two adjacent bright spots (y) using the tangent function and the distance from the grating to the screen (L = 1 m):\n\ntan(θ) ≈ θ_rad ≈ y / L\n\ny ≈ θ_rad * L = 0.2205 * 1 m ≈ 0.2205 m\n\nSo, the distance between the two adjacent bright spots formed on the screen is approximately 0.2205 meters or 22.05 cm."
