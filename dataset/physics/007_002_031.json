    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive element has an initial activity of 2000 counts per minute. If the half-life of the element is 5 days, what would be its activity after 15 days?",
    "message_2": "To find the activity of the radioactive element after 15 days, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * (1/2)^(time_elapsed / half_life)\n\nwhere Activity_initial is the initial activity (2000 counts per minute), time_elapsed is the time that has passed (15 days), and half_life is the half-life of the element (5 days).\n\nActivity_final = 2000 * (1/2)^(15 / 5)\n\nActivity_final = 2000 * (1/2)^3\n\nActivity_final = 2000 * (1/8)\n\nActivity_final = 250 counts per minute\n\nSo, after 15 days, the activity of the radioactive element would be 250 counts per minute."
