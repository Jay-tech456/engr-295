    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆H is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the change in entropy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) and standard entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction. We can find these values using the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) and standard molar entropies (S°) of the reactants and products.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nH2 (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2HCl (g)\n\nThe standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for the species involved are:\n\nΔHf° (H2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (Cl2) = 0 kJ/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)\nΔHf° (HCl) = -92.31 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) for the reaction:\n\n∆H° = [2 × ΔHf° (HCl)] - [ΔHf° (H2) + ΔHf° (Cl2)]\n∆H° = [2 × (-92.31 kJ/mol)] - [0 + 0]\n∆H° = -184.62 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to find the standard molar entropies (S°) for the species involved:\n\nS° (H2) = 130.68 J/mol·K\nS° (Cl2) = 223.07 J/mol·K\nS° (HCl) = 186.90 J/mol·K\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard entropy change (∆S°) for the reaction:\n\n∆S° = [2 × S° (HCl)] - [S° (H2) + S° (Cl2)]\n∆S° = [2 × (186.90 J/mol·K)] - [(130.68 J/mol·K) + (223.07 J/mol·K)]\n∆S° = (373.80 J/mol·K) - (353.75 J/mol·K)\n∆S° = 20.05 J/mol·K\n\nNow that we have both ∆H° and ∆S°, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) at 298 K:\n\n∆G = ∆H° - T∆S°\n∆G = (-184.62 kJ/mol) - (298 K × 20.05 J/mol·K × 1 kJ/1000 J)\n∆G = -184.62 kJ/mol - (298 K × 0.02005 kJ/mol·K)\n∆G = -184.62 kJ/mol - 5.98 kJ/mol\n∆G = -190.60 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change (∆G) for the reaction of hydrogen gas (H2) with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form hydrogen chloride (2HCl) gas at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm is -190.60 kJ/mol."
