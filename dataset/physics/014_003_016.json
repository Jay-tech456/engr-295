    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is the remnant thermal radiation from the early universe, which has cooled down as the universe expanded. It is almost uniform in all directions and has a blackbody spectrum. The temperature of the CMB can be determined from the peak of this blackbody spectrum using Planck's law.\n\nBased on the measurements from various experiments, such as the COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellite missions, the temperature of the CMB radiation is approximately 2.7255 Kelvin (K). This value represents the current temperature of the \"infinite universe\" based on the CMB radiation."
