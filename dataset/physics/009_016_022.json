    "message_2": "To calculate the distance between the first and second minima on the screen, we can use the formula for the angular position of the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ_min = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ_min is the angular position of the minima, m is the order of the minima (1 for the first minimum, 2 for the second minimum, etc.), λ is the wavelength of the laser beam, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to meters:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m\na = 0.2 mm = 0.2 * 10^(-3) m\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first and second minima:\n\nθ_min1 = (1 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)) = 2.5 * 10^(-6) rad\nθ_min2 = (2 * 500 * 10^(-9)) / (0.2 * 10^(-3)) = 5 * 10^(-6) rad\n\nNext, we can use the small angle approximation to find the linear distance between the minima on the screen:\n\ny_min = L * θ_min\n\nwhere y_min is the linear distance from the central maximum to the minimum, and L is the distance from the slit to the screen.\n\ny_min1 = 2 * 2.5 * 10^(-6) = 5 * 10^(-6) m\ny_min2 = 2 * 5 * 10^(-6) = 10 * 10^(-6) m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance between the first and second minima:\n\nΔy = y_min2 - y_min1 = (10 * 10^(-6) - 5 * 10^(-6)) m = 5 * 10^(-6) m\n\nSo, the distance between the first and second minima on the screen is 5 * 10^(-6) meters or 5 micrometers."
