    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy has a significant impact on the shape of the galaxy's rotation curve. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in a galaxy versus their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to Newtonian dynamics, the rotation curve should decrease as the distance from the center increases, following the distribution of visible matter.\n\nHowever, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the orbital speeds of stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies do not decrease as expected. Instead, they remain relatively constant or even slightly increase with distance from the center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter led to the hypothesis of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it undetectable through direct observation. It is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe and plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nThe presence of dark matter in a galaxy creates an additional gravitational force that affects the motion of stars and gas in the galaxy. This additional force is responsible for the observed flat or slightly increasing rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies. The more dark matter present in a galaxy, the more significant the effect on the rotation curve.\n\nIn summary, there is a strong relation between the distribution of dark matter and the shape of a galaxy's rotation curve. The presence of dark matter in a galaxy results in a flatter rotation curve, with the outer edges of the galaxy rotating at similar or slightly higher speeds than expected based on the distribution of visible matter alone. This trend indicates that the amount of dark matter present in a galaxy has a direct impact on the speed of rotation of its outer edges."
