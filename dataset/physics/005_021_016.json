    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is given by:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two objects, c is the speed of light, and v is the relative velocity between the two objects.\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity of the laser beam relative to the mirror. We will use the velocity addition formula with v1 = 0.95c (the speed of the laser beam) and v2 = -0.6c (the speed of the mirror, negative because it's moving away from the laser).\n\nv_relative = (0.95c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.95c * -0.6c) / c^2)\nv_relative = (0.35c) / (1 + 0.57)\nv_relative ≈ 0.223c\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of the reflected beam relative to the mirror. Since the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, the speed of the reflected beam relative to the mirror is the same as the speed of the incoming beam relative to the mirror, which is 0.223c.\n\nFinally, we need to find the speed of the reflected beam relative to the lab frame. We will use the velocity addition formula again, with v1 = 0.223c (the speed of the reflected beam relative to the mirror) and v2 = -0.6c (the speed of the mirror, negative because it's moving away from the laser).\n\nv_reflected = (0.223c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.223c * -0.6c) / c^2)\nv_reflected ≈ -0.376c\n\nThe speed of the reflected beam as measured by an observer in the lab frame is approximately -0.376c, which means it is moving towards the observer at 37.6% the speed of light."
