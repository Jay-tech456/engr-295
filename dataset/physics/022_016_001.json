    "message_2": "The hypothesis that dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos with a mass between 1 keV and 1 MeV is based on several experimental observations and theoretical considerations. While there is no direct detection of sterile neutrinos yet, the following indirect evidence supports this hypothesis:\n\n1. The missing mass problem: Observations of galaxy rotation curves, galaxy clusters, and gravitational lensing indicate that there is more mass in the universe than can be accounted for by visible matter. This missing mass, known as dark matter, is thought to be composed of non-luminous particles that interact only through gravity. Sterile neutrinos are one of the leading candidates for dark matter because they are neutral, have a small mass, and interact very weakly with other particles.\n\n2. The small-scale structure problem: Cold dark matter (CDM) models predict an overabundance of small-scale structures, such as dwarf galaxies and subhalos, compared to what is observed in the universe. Sterile neutrinos with a mass in the keV range, known as warm dark matter (WDM), can alleviate this problem because their free-streaming properties can suppress the formation of small-scale structures. This makes them a more attractive dark matter candidate than CDM particles.\n\n3. Neutrino oscillations: Neutrino oscillation experiments have provided evidence for the existence of three active neutrino flavors (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos) and their corresponding antineutrinos. However, some anomalies in neutrino oscillation data suggest the possible existence of a fourth, sterile neutrino flavor. If confirmed, this would provide strong evidence for the existence of sterile neutrinos as a dark matter candidate.\n\n4. X-ray observations: Some studies have reported the detection of an unidentified X-ray emission line at an energy of around 3.5 keV in the spectra of galaxy clusters and other astrophysical objects. This emission line could be the result of the decay of sterile neutrinos with a mass of around 7 keV into active neutrinos and photons. However, these observations are still debated, and more data is needed to confirm or refute this interpretation.\n\n5. Theoretical motivations: Sterile neutrinos can be naturally incorporated into extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as models with extra dimensions or right-handed neutrinos. These models can provide a theoretical framework for understanding the origin and properties of sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates.\n\nIn summary, while there is no direct detection of sterile neutrinos yet, several experimental observations and theoretical considerations support the hypothesis that dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos with a mass between 1 keV and 1 MeV. Further experiments, such as improved X-ray observations and searches for sterile neutrino signatures in neutrino oscillation experiments, will be crucial to test this hypothesis and shed light on the nature of dark matter."
