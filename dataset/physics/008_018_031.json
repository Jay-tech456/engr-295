    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, also known as the QCD coupling constant or αs, is a fundamental parameter in the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD). Its value depends on the energy scale at which it is measured.\n\nDuring the LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider) experiments at CERN, the strong coupling constant was measured at the energy scale of the Z boson mass, which is approximately 91.2 GeV. The combined result from the four LEP experiments (ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, and OPAL) provided a value for the strong coupling constant at this energy scale:\n\nαs(Mz) = 0.118 ± 0.003\n\nThis value is consistent with other measurements and theoretical predictions. It is important to note that the strong coupling constant runs with energy, meaning its value changes as the energy scale changes."
