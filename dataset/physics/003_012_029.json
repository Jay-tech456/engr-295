    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a perfectly conducting plane that carries a current of 2 A in the x-direction, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, since the plane is infinitely large, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by the current in the plane as a whole.\n\nFor an infinitely large conducting plane, the magnetic field produced by the current is uniform and perpendicular to the plane. In this case, the magnetic field will be in the z-direction. The magnitude of the magnetic field can be calculated using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * d)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), and d is the distance from the plane (5 cm = 0.05 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.1 m)\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the perfectly conducting plane is 8 × 10^(-6) T in the z-direction."
