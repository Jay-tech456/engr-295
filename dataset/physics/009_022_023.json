    "message_1": "A physics student is given a glass slab of refractive index 1.5. The incident light falls on the glass slab making an angle of incidence of 60 degrees. Find the angle between the reflected and refracted rays using Brewster's Law.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the reflected and refracted rays, we first need to find the angle of refraction using Snell's Law and then use Brewster's Law to find the angle of polarization.\n\nSnell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nGiven that the refractive index of air is approximately 1, the refractive index of the glass slab is 1.5, and the angle of incidence is 60 degrees, we can find the angle of refraction (θ2) as follows:\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60) = 0.866\n0.866 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(θ2) = 0.866 / 1.5\nsin(θ2) ≈ 0.577\n\nθ2 ≈ arcsin(0.577)\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nNow, we can use Brewster's Law to find the angle of polarization (θp):\n\ntan(θp) = n2 / n1\n\ntan(θp) = 1.5 / 1\nθp ≈ arctan(1.5)\nθp ≈ 56.3 degrees\n\nSince the angle of polarization is the angle between the reflected and refracted rays, the angle between the reflected and refracted rays is approximately 56.3 degrees."
