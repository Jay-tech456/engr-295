    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) of a protein denaturation process, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = -RT ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the protein stability constant.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:\n\nT = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G = - (8.314 J/mol·K) × (323.15 K) × ln(0.05)\n\n∆G ≈ 12,000 J/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the protein denaturation process at 50°C with a protein stability constant of 0.05 is approximately 12,000 J/mol."
