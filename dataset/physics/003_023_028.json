    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the induced emf in the coil, we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. The formula for Faraday's law is:\n\nemf = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt)\n\nwhere emf is the induced electromotive force, N is the number of turns in the coil, ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux, and Δt is the time taken for the change.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial and final magnetic flux through the coil. The magnetic flux (Φ) through a coil is given by:\n\nΦ = B * A * cos(θ)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area of the coil, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plane of the coil.\n\nInitially, the coil is parallel to the magnetic field (θ = 0 degrees), so the initial magnetic flux is:\n\nΦ_initial = B * A * cos(0)\nΦ_initial = 0.5 T * (20 cm * 30 cm) * cos(0)\nΦ_initial = 0.5 T * (0.2 m * 0.3 m) * 1\nΦ_initial = 0.5 T * 0.06 m²\nΦ_initial = 0.03 Wb\n\nAfter turning through 90 degrees, the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field (θ = 90 degrees), so the final magnetic flux is:\n\nΦ_final = B * A * cos(90)\nΦ_final = 0.5 T * (20 cm * 30 cm) * cos(90)\nΦ_final = 0.5 T * (0.2 m * 0.3 m) * 0\nΦ_final = 0 Wb\n\nNow we can find the change in magnetic flux:\n\nΔΦ = Φ_final - Φ_initial\nΔΦ = 0 Wb - 0.03 Wb\nΔΦ = -0.03 Wb\n\nNow we can use Faraday's law to find the induced emf:\n\nemf = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt)\nemf = -100 turns * (-0.03 Wb / 0.1 s)\nemf = 100 turns * 0.3 Wb/s\nemf = 30 V\n\nThe magnitude of the induced emf is 30 V.\n\nAs for the direction of the induced emf, we can use Lenz's law, which states that the induced emf will create a current that produces a magnetic field that opposes the change in magnetic flux. In this case, since the magnetic flux is decreasing as the coil turns, the induced current will create a magnetic field that tries to maintain the initial magnetic flux. This means that the induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field opposing the change in the magnetic field.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the induced emf in the coil is 30 V, and the direction of the induced emf is such that it creates a magnetic field opposing the change in the magnetic field."
