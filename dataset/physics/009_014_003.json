    "message_1": "A physics student is required to design an experiment to demonstrate and quantify the chromatic aberration of a lens. The student has a converging lens with a focal length of 10 cm, and sources of red and blue light. The student needs to determine the distance between the red and blue focal lengths produced by the lens and calculate the magnitude of the chromatic aberration.",
    "message_2": "To design an experiment to demonstrate and quantify the chromatic aberration of a lens, the student can follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the experiment: Place the converging lens on an optical bench or a long table. Mount the red and blue light sources on one side of the lens, and place a white screen on the other side of the lens to project the images formed by the lens.\n\n2. Find the focal points for each color: Adjust the distance between the light sources and the lens until a sharp image of each light source is formed on the screen. Measure the distance from the lens to the screen for each color. This distance is the focal length for each color (f_red and f_blue).\n\n3. Calculate the chromatic aberration: The chromatic aberration is the difference between the focal lengths of the red and blue light. Calculate the chromatic aberration by subtracting the focal length of the red light from the focal length of the blue light:\n\nChromatic aberration = |f_red - f_blue|\n\n4. Analyze the results: The chromatic aberration value indicates the extent to which the lens fails to focus the different colors of light at the same point. A larger chromatic aberration value indicates a greater degree of color separation and a lower quality lens.\n\nNote: The student should keep in mind that the focal length provided (10 cm) is an approximate value, and the actual focal lengths for red and blue light may differ due to the dispersion of the lens material."
