    "message_2": "The expected effect of dark matter on the observed distortions in the shapes of galaxies caused by gravitational lensing is that it enhances the lensing effect. Dark matter, although not directly observable, contributes to the overall mass of a galaxy or galaxy cluster, and therefore increases the gravitational force exerted on light passing through the region. This results in a stronger lensing effect, causing more significant distortions in the shapes of background galaxies.\n\nObservations of gravitational lensing can be used to infer properties of dark matter in the universe by analyzing the mass distribution and the strength of the lensing effect. Since dark matter is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe, the presence of dark matter can be inferred by comparing the observed lensing effects with the expected lensing effects based on the visible mass of galaxies or galaxy clusters. If the observed lensing effect is stronger than what would be expected from the visible mass alone, this suggests the presence of additional mass in the form of dark matter.\n\nThere are several examples of gravitational lensing events where the presence of dark matter has been inferred:\n\n1. The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558): This is a famous example of a galaxy cluster collision where the presence of dark matter was inferred through gravitational lensing. Observations of the Bullet Cluster show that the mass distribution inferred from gravitational lensing is offset from the distribution of visible mass (gas and stars), suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n2. Abell 1689: This massive galaxy cluster exhibits strong gravitational lensing effects, with numerous arcs and distorted background galaxies visible in images. The mass distribution inferred from the lensing effect indicates the presence of a large amount of dark matter in the cluster.\n\n3. The Cosmic Horseshoe (SDSS J1148+1930): This is a gravitationally lensed galaxy that appears as a nearly complete ring around a foreground galaxy. The strong lensing effect observed in this system suggests the presence of a significant amount of dark matter in the foreground galaxy.\n\nThese examples, along with many others, provide strong evidence for the presence of dark matter in the universe. By studying gravitational lensing events, physicists can gain valuable insights into the properties and distribution of dark matter, helping to improve our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe."
