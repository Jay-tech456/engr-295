    "message_2": "The Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is the distance between the nucleus and the electron in the ground state (n = 1) of the hydrogen atom. It is denoted by the symbol 'a₀'. The formula to calculate the Bohr radius is given by:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere\nε₀ = permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²)\nħ = reduced Planck's constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\nm_e = mass of the electron (9.109 x 10⁻³¹ kg)\ne = charge of the electron (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the Bohr radius:\n\na₀ = (4π * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴)²) / (9.109 x 10⁻³¹ * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹)²)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291 x 10⁻¹¹ meters."
