    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to determine the Gibbs free energy of the products and reactants.\n\nFor the products, we have 2 moles of H2O(l), so we multiply the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of H2O(l) by 2:\nΔG(products) = 2 * (-237.2 kJ/mol) = -474.4 kJ/mol\n\nFor the reactants, we have 2 moles of H2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g), so we multiply the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of H2(g) by 2 and add it to the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of O2(g):\nΔG(reactants) = 2 * (-6.8 kJ/mol) + 0 kJ/mol = -13.6 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction:\nΔG = ΔG(products) - ΔG(reactants) = -474.4 kJ/mol - (-13.6 kJ/mol) = -460.8 kJ/mol\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l) at 298 K is -460.8 kJ/mol."
