    "message_2": "Experimental evidence for dark matter comes primarily from its gravitational effects on visible matter, cosmic microwave background radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. While dark matter has not been directly detected, its presence is inferred through several key observations:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas further from the galactic center move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which contributes additional mass and gravitational pull.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These studies consistently show that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. The distribution of temperature fluctuations in the CMB is influenced by the presence of dark matter, which affects the formation of large-scale structures. Observations of the CMB are consistent with a universe composed of approximately 27% dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match observations, while those without dark matter do not.\n\nSeveral particle physics theories have been proposed to explain the nature and interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter. Some of the leading candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. They are predicted by supersymmetry, a theoretical extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. WIMPs are among the most widely studied dark matter candidates and are the target of many direct detection experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider and dark matter detectors like XENON1T and LUX.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are much lighter than WIMPs and interact very weakly with ordinary matter, making them difficult to detect. However, several experiments, such as the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) and the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), are searching for axions.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact through any of the known forces except gravity. They are an extension of the Standard Model's neutrino sector and could be produced in the early universe. While they are more challenging to detect than other dark matter candidates, some experiments, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, are searching for signatures of sterile neutrinos.\n\nThese are just a few of the many possible dark matter candidates. The true nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics, and ongoing experiments continue to search for direct evidence of these elusive particles and their interactions with ordinary matter."
