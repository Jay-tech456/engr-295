    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic mass of the particle, we can use the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass (5 kg), v is the velocity (0.9c), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.9c)^2 / c^2 = 0.81\n\nNow, we can calculate 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19\n\nNext, we can find the square root of 1 - v^2/c^2:\n\nsqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = sqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.43589\n\nFinally, we can calculate the relativistic mass:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 5 kg / 0.43589 ≈ 11.47 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the particle is approximately 11.47 kg.\n\nTo find the energy required to achieve this velocity, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (m - m0) * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the relativistic mass (11.47 kg), m0 is the rest mass (5 kg), and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the difference between the relativistic mass and the rest mass:\n\nm - m0 = 11.47 kg - 5 kg = 6.47 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n\nE = (m - m0) * c^2 = 6.47 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 ≈ 5.82 x 10^17 J\n\nThe energy required to achieve this velocity is approximately 5.82 x 10^17 Joules."
