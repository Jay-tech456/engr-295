    "message_2": "The doping concentration plays a crucial role in determining the critical temperature (Tc) of high-temperature superconductors. High-temperature superconductors are materials that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures higher than those of conventional superconductors. The most well-known high-temperature superconductors are cuprates, which are copper oxide-based compounds, and iron-based superconductors.\n\nDoping refers to the process of introducing impurities or foreign atoms into a material to modify its electronic properties. In high-temperature superconductors, doping can either introduce charge carriers (holes or electrons) or modify the crystal lattice structure, which in turn affects the superconducting properties.\n\nExperimental evidence has shown that the critical temperature of high-temperature superconductors is strongly dependent on the doping concentration. The relationship between doping and critical temperature can be described by a dome-shaped curve, where Tc increases with increasing doping up to an optimal doping level, and then decreases as doping is further increased.\n\n1. Cuprate Superconductors:\n\nIn cuprate superconductors, the parent compounds are insulators with antiferromagnetic order. Doping introduces charge carriers (holes) into the copper oxide planes, which leads to the emergence of superconductivity. The most studied cuprate is YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO), where x represents the oxygen content.\n\nA study by Tallon et al. (1995) showed that the critical temperature of YBCO increases with increasing hole concentration (doping) up to an optimal value, and then decreases as the hole concentration is further increased. The optimal doping level corresponds to the highest Tc, which is around 92 K for YBCO.\n\n2. Iron-based Superconductors:\n\nIron-based superconductors are another class of high-temperature superconductors. They consist of layers of iron and pnictogen or chalcogen atoms. Doping in these materials can be achieved by substituting atoms in the crystal lattice or by introducing interstitial atoms.\n\nFor example, in the iron-pnictide compound BaFe2As2, superconductivity can be induced by doping with either electrons (e.g., by substituting Co or Ni for Fe) or holes (e.g., by substituting K or Na for Ba). The critical temperature of these materials also exhibits a dome-shaped dependence on doping concentration.\n\nA study by Rotter et al. (2008) on Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 showed that the critical temperature increases with increasing Co doping up to an optimal value, and then decreases as the doping is further increased. The optimal doping level corresponds to the highest Tc, which is around 25 K for this compound.\n\nIn conclusion, the doping concentration has a significant impact on the critical temperature of high-temperature superconductors. Experimental evidence from cuprate and iron-based superconductors demonstrates that the relationship between doping and critical temperature follows a dome-shaped curve, with an optimal doping level corresponding to the highest Tc."
