    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. There are several lines of evidence that support the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, unseen dark matter halo surrounding the galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These studies consistently show that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the distribution of matter and energy at that time. The observed pattern of fluctuations is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which affects the way that matter clumps together.\n\n4. Large-scale structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps to hold these structures together.\n\n5. Numerical simulations: Computer simulations of the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, which include the effects of dark matter, are able to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThe existence of dark matter has implications for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics because it suggests that there are particles and interactions that are not described by the Standard Model of particle physics. The most popular BSM candidates for dark matter are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which interact with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. Other BSM candidates include axions, sterile neutrinos, and primordial black holes.\n\nThe search for dark matter particles is an active area of research in both experimental and theoretical physics. Direct detection experiments aim to observe the interactions of dark matter particles with ordinary matter, while indirect detection experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays. Additionally, particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), may produce dark matter particles in high-energy collisions, providing further evidence for BSM physics."
