    "message_1": "A refrigerator works between two heat reservoirs at temperatures of 5℃ and 25℃. If the refrigerator consumes 200 J of work, calculate the coefficient of performance and the amount of heat extracted from the refrigerated space.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator, we can use the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nwhere Q_c is the amount of heat extracted from the refrigerated space, and W is the work done by the refrigerator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Carnot efficiency, which is the maximum efficiency that a heat engine can achieve operating between two heat reservoirs at temperatures T_c (cold reservoir) and T_h (hot reservoir). The Carnot efficiency is given by:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_c / T_h)\n\nSince the temperatures are given in Celsius, we need to convert them to Kelvin:\n\nT_c = 5℃ + 273.15 = 278.15 K\nT_h = 25℃ + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (278.15 / 298.15) = 1 - 0.9328 = 0.0672\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator is the inverse of the Carnot efficiency:\n\nCOP = 1 / Carnot efficiency = 1 / 0.0672 ≈ 14.88\n\nNow that we have the COP, we can calculate the amount of heat extracted from the refrigerated space (Q_c):\n\nQ_c = COP * W = 14.88 * 200 J = 2976 J\n\nSo, the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is approximately 14.88, and the amount of heat extracted from the refrigerated space is 2976 J."
