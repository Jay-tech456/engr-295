    "message_2": "To find the ratio of the final kinetic energy to the rest mass energy of the particle, we will use the relativistic kinetic energy formula and the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy formula is given by:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor for the given velocity (0.99c):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99c/c)^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99^2)\nγ ≈ 7.0888\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK ≈ (7.0888 - 1)mc^2\nK ≈ 6.0888mc^2\n\nThe ratio of the final kinetic energy to the rest mass energy of the particle is:\n\nK / (mc^2) = 6.0888\n\nSo, the ratio of the final kinetic energy to the rest mass energy of the particle is approximately 6.0888."
