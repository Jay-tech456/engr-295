If the refractive index of the denser medium is 1.50 and that of the rarer medium is 1.00, calculate the critical angle and determine if there will be total internal reflection or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there will be total internal reflection, we first need to calculate the critical angle. The critical angle (θc) can be found using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nFor total internal reflection, θ2 = 90 degrees. So, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90)\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nPlugging in the given values for the refractive indices (n1 = 1.50, n2 = 1.00):\n\nsin(θc) = 1.00 / 1.50\nsin(θc) = 0.6667\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine:\n\nθc = arcsin(0.6667)\nθc ≈ 41.81 degrees\n\nNow, we need to determine if there will be total internal reflection. The angle of incidence (40 degrees) is less than the critical angle (41.81 degrees), so there will not be total internal reflection in this case."
