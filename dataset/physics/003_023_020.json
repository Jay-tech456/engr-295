    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 meters from the center of the generator, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (5 A), and r is the distance from the center of the generator (2 meters).\n\nHowever, since the generator has 1000 turns per meter, we need to account for the total number of turns within the 0.5-meter radius. The total number of turns (N) is:\n\nN = turns per meter * radius\nN = 1000 turns/m * 0.5 m\nN = 500 turns\n\nNow, we need to multiply the current by the number of turns to get the total current (Itotal) flowing through the generator:\n\nItotal = I * N\nItotal = 5 A * 500\nItotal = 2500 A\n\nNow we can use Ampere's Law to calculate the magnetic field (B) at a distance of 2 meters from the center of the generator:\n\nB = (μ₀ * Itotal) / (2 * π * r)\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2500 A) / (2 * π * 2 m)\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2500) / (4)\nB = 0.000625 T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 2 meters from the center of the generator is 0.000625 T (tesla)."
