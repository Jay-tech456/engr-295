    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction in the prism, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass prism), θ1 is the angle of incidence, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 (air) = 1, θ1 = 60 degrees, and n2 (glass prism) = 1.5. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60) = 0.866 (approximately)\n\n0.866 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.866 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.577 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.577:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.577)\n\nθ2 ≈ 35.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction in the prism is approximately 35.3 degrees."
