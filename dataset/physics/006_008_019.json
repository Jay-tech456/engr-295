    "message_2": "To find the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons released, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nK_max = hf - W\n\nwhere K_max is the maximum kinetic energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js), f is the frequency of the photon (6.0 × 10¹⁴ Hz), and W is the work function of silver (4.73 eV).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the work function from eV to Joules. We know that 1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J, so:\n\nW = 4.73 eV × (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) = 7.576 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum kinetic energy:\n\nK_max = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js) × (6.0 × 10¹⁴ Hz) - 7.576 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\nK_max = 3.976 × 10⁻¹⁹ J - 7.576 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\nK_max = -3.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nSince the kinetic energy cannot be negative, this means that the photon's energy is not enough to overcome the work function of silver, and no electrons will be released. The maximum kinetic energy of the electrons released is 0 J."
