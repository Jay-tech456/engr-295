    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force on a sphere, we can use the drag force equation:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * ρ * v^2 * A * C_D\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the sphere, A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere, and C_D is the coefficient of drag.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the sphere. The cross-sectional area of a sphere can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5 cm, which is equivalent to 0.05 m. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nA = π * (0.05 m)^2 ≈ 0.00785 m²\n\nNow we have all the values needed to calculate the drag force:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * (1.2 kg/m³) * (10 m/s)^2 * (0.00785 m²) * (0.47)\n\nF_D ≈ 0.5 * 1.2 * 100 * 0.00785 * 0.47\nF_D ≈ 1.76 N\n\nThe drag force on the sphere is approximately 1.76 Newtons."
