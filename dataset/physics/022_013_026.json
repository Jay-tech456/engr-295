    "message_2": "Dark matter and dark energy are two distinct components of the universe that play significant roles in its expansion. While both are invisible and do not interact with light, they have different effects on the expansion of the universe.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable through direct observation. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that permeates all of space and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is estimated to constitute about 68% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.\n\nThe influence of dark matter on the expansion of the universe is primarily through its gravitational effects. Dark matter acts as a source of gravity, pulling matter together and slowing down the expansion of the universe. In the early universe, dark matter played a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, by providing the necessary gravitational force to hold them together.\n\nDark energy, in contrast, has a repulsive effect on the expansion of the universe. It is believed to be responsible for the observed acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe, which was first discovered in the late 1990s through observations of distant supernovae. This acceleration implies that the expansion of the universe is not only continuing but also speeding up over time.\n\nSpecific evidence supporting the existence and influence of dark matter and dark energy includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies indicate that they contain more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, provides further evidence for the existence of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter and dark energy, as they provide the necessary gravitational and repulsive forces to shape the observed structures.\n\nIn summary, dark matter and dark energy have contrasting effects on the expansion of the universe. Dark matter's gravitational influence tends to slow down the expansion, while dark energy causes it to accelerate. The current understanding of the universe's composition and expansion is supported by various lines of evidence, including galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB radiation, and large-scale structure formation."
