    "message_2": "To find the angle of incidence on a polarizing sheet needed to produce a polarization contrast ratio of 10:1, we can use the Brewster's angle formula and the Malus's law.\n\nBrewster's angle formula is given by:\n\ntan(θ_B) = n₂ / n₁\n\nwhere θ_B is the Brewster's angle, n₁ is the refractive index of the first medium (air), and n₂ is the refractive index of the second medium (polarizing sheet). For simplicity, we will assume n₁ = 1 and n₂ = 1.5 (typical value for glass or plastic).\n\nθ_B = arctan(1.5 / 1) ≈ 56.31°\n\nAt the Brewster's angle, the reflected light is completely polarized. Now, we need to find the angle of incidence (θ) that will produce a polarization contrast ratio of 10:1.\n\nMalus's law states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the plane of polarization and the plane of incidence (θ - θ_B):\n\nI_t = I₀ * cos²(θ - θ_B)\n\nwhere I₀ is the intensity of the incident light (10 W/m² in this case).\n\nWe want the intensity of the transmitted light to be 10 times less than the incident light:\n\nI_t = I₀ / 10\n\n10 W/m² * cos²(θ - 56.31°) = 1 W/m²\n\ncos²(θ - 56.31°) = 1/10\n\nNow, we can solve for θ:\n\ncos(θ - 56.31°) = ±sqrt(1/10)\n\nθ - 56.31° = arccos(±sqrt(1/10))\n\nThere are two possible solutions for θ:\n\nθ₁ = 56.31° + arccos(sqrt(1/10)) ≈ 74.48°\nθ₂ = 56.31° - arccos(sqrt(1/10)) ≈ 38.14°\n\nSo, the angle of incidence on the polarizing sheet needed to produce a polarization contrast ratio of 10:1 is approximately 38.14° or 74.48°."
