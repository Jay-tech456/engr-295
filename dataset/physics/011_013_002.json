    "message_2": "To find the electrical conductivity (σ) of copper, we can use the formula:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nwhere ρ is the resistivity of the material. In this case, the resistivity of copper (ρ) is given as 1.72 x 10^-8 ohm-meters.\n\nσ = 1 / (1.72 x 10^-8)\nσ ≈ 5.81 x 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nNow, we have the electrical conductivity of copper at 20°C. However, the cross-sectional area of the copper wire is also given, which is 2 square millimeters. To find the conductance (G) of the copper wire, we can use the formula:\n\nG = σ * A / L\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area and L is the length of the wire. We don't have the length of the wire, so we can't find the conductance directly. However, we have found the electrical conductivity of copper at 20°C, which is:\n\nσ ≈ 5.81 x 10^7 S/m"
