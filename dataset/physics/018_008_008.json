    "message_2": "Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are a class of theoretical models in particle physics that aim to unify the three non-gravitational forces: the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces into a single force at high energy scales. One of the key predictions of GUTs is that protons can decay, albeit with an extremely long lifetime.\n\nThe proton decay rate is typically expressed in terms of the proton's lifetime, which is the average time it takes for a proton to decay. GUTs predict that the proton lifetime should be within the range of 10^29 to 10^36 years, depending on the specific model and the parameters used. This is an incredibly long time compared to the age of the universe, which is around 13.8 billion years (approximately 10^9 years).\n\nExperimental results have not yet observed proton decay directly, but they have set lower limits on the proton's lifetime. The most stringent limit comes from the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan, which has set a lower limit of 1.6 x 10^34 years for the proton's lifetime for certain decay modes. This result is consistent with the predictions of GUTs, as it falls within the range of expected lifetimes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the non-observation of proton decay so far does not rule out GUTs, as the predicted lifetimes are still within the experimental limits. Future experiments with increased sensitivity may be able to detect proton decay or further constrain its lifetime, providing more information on the validity of GUTs and their predictions."
