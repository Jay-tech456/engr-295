    "message_2": "To find the pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of the oil, we can use the formula for pressure in a fluid column:\n\nP = ρgh\n\nwhere P is the pressure, ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the fluid column.\n\nIn this case, the density of the oil (ρ) is 800 kg/m³, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.81 m/s², and the height of the oil column (h) is 2 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = (800 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)(2 m)\n\nP = 15,688 kg·m²/s²·m³\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg·m²/s²·m³, the pressure at the bottom of the tank is:\n\nP = 15,688 Pa"
