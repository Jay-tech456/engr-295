    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between two Zeeman-split spectral lines, we need to consider the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. This interaction is described by the Zeeman effect.\n\nThe energy difference between two adjacent Zeeman levels can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the external magnetic field, and Δm_j is the difference in the magnetic quantum number between the two levels.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the Bohr magneton (μ_B) is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * ħ / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.055 x 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^(-31) kg).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nμ_B = (1.602 x 10^(-19) C) * (1.055 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, let's consider the external magnetic field B = 0.5 T. For the hydrogen atom, the difference in the magnetic quantum number between two adjacent Zeeman levels is Δm_j = 1.\n\nUsing the formula for the energy difference, we get:\n\nΔE = (9.274 x 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * 1\nΔE ≈ 4.637 x 10^(-24) J\n\nSo, the energy difference between two Zeeman-split spectral lines of an atomic transition when subjected to an external magnetic field of 0.5 tesla on a sample of hydrogen atom is approximately 4.637 x 10^(-24) joules."
