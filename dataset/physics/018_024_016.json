    "message_2": "The electromagnetic coupling constant, also known as the fine-structure constant (α), is a fundamental constant in physics that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic force between elementary charged particles. It is dimensionless and is approximately equal to 1/137. \n\nIn the process of electron-positron annihilation, an electron and its antiparticle, the positron, collide and annihilate each other, producing a pair of photons. The fine-structure constant can be determined from the cross-section of this process, which is the probability of the interaction occurring.\n\nThe precise value of the fine-structure constant, as determined by various experimental methods, including electron-positron annihilation, is:\n\nα ≈ 1/137.035999084(21)\n\nThe number in parentheses represents the uncertainty in the last digits of the value. This value is continuously refined as experimental techniques improve, but it is currently one of the most accurately known fundamental constants in physics."
