    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the thin lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = -20 cm (concave lens has a negative focal length)\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe need to find di:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we first find the common denominator:\n\n-60 = 2di + 3di\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n-60 = 5di\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ndi = -60/5\ndi = -12 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is a virtual image.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, di is the image distance, and do is the object distance.\n\nM = -(-12)/30\nM = 12/30\nM = 0.4\n\nThe magnification is 0.4, which means the image is smaller than the object (40% of the object size).\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the concave lens is a virtual image located 12 cm from the lens on the same side as the object, and its size is 40% of the object size."
