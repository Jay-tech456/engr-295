    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of wire:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * r²) / (2 * (R² + r²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the toroid, N is the number of turns, r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field, and R is the mean radius of the toroid.\n\nGiven:\nI = 5 A\nN = 400 turns\nR = 12 cm = 0.12 m\nr = 6 cm = 0.06 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 400 * (0.06 m)²) / (2 * (0.12 m² + 0.06 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 2000 * 0.0036 m²) / ((0.0144 m² + 0.0036 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1.6π × 10^(-4) T * 7.2) / (0.018 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (1.152π × 10^(-3) T) / 0.002376\n\nB ≈ 0.482 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the toroid, 6 cm from the center of the toroid, is approximately 0.482 T."
