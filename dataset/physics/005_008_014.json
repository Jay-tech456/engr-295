Calculate the time elapsed on Earth during the journey, taking into account the effects of time dilation predicted by Lorentz transformation of coordinates and time.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the time elapsed on Earth during the journey, we need to consider the time dilation effect predicted by the special theory of relativity. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nΔt = Δt0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere Δt is the time elapsed on Earth (also known as the dilated time), Δt0 is the proper time (time elapsed according to the spacecraft's clock), v is the relative velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n\nΔt0 = 12 years\nv = 0.6c\n\nWe can now plug these values into the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = 12 years / √(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\n\nΔt = 12 years / √(1 - 0.36)\n\nΔt = 12 years / √(0.64)\n\nΔt = 12 years / 0.8\n\nΔt ≈ 15 years\n\nSo, the time elapsed on Earth during the journey is approximately 15 years."
