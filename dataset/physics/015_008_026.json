    "message_2": "Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as merging black holes or neutron stars. These waves travel at the speed of light and carry energy away from the source of the disturbance.\n\nWhen gravitational waves encounter a black hole's event horizon, they are affected by the extreme curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the black hole. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. As gravitational waves propagate towards the event horizon, they are stretched and distorted due to the strong gravitational field.\n\nUpon reaching the event horizon, the gravitational waves cannot escape the black hole, and they are effectively absorbed by it. This absorption of energy contributes to the growth of the black hole's mass. However, it is important to note that the details of what happens to gravitational waves inside the event horizon are not well understood, as our current understanding of physics breaks down in the extreme conditions within a black hole.\n\nThe observable effects of gravitational waves on the surrounding space-time can be detected by highly sensitive instruments, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). When gravitational waves pass through space-time, they cause tiny oscillations in the distances between objects. These oscillations can be measured by interferometers, which use lasers to detect the minute changes in the distance between mirrors.\n\nIn the case of a black hole merger, the surrounding space-time is significantly distorted, leading to the emission of strong gravitational waves. The detection of these waves not only provides evidence for the existence of black holes but also offers insights into their properties, such as their masses and spins. Additionally, the study of gravitational waves can help improve our understanding of general relativity and the fundamental nature of space-time itself."
