And what is the figure of merit of a thermoelectric material, and how is it related to the material's electrical and thermal conductivity?",
    "message_2": "The relationship between electrical conductivity (σ) and thermal conductivity (κ) of a material is essential in the investigation of thermoelectric properties. This relationship is described by the Wiedemann-Franz Law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature (T) of the material:\n\nκ/σ = L * T\n\nHere, L is the Lorentz number, which is a constant with a value of approximately 2.44 x 10^(-8) WΩK^(-2).\n\nThe figure of merit (ZT) is a dimensionless quantity used to evaluate the performance of a thermoelectric material. It is defined as:\n\nZT = (S^2 * σ * T) / κ\n\nwhere S is the Seebeck coefficient (also known as thermopower), which measures the voltage generated per unit temperature difference across the material. A higher ZT value indicates better thermoelectric performance.\n\nThe figure of merit is related to the material's electrical and thermal conductivity through the equation above. To achieve a high ZT value, a material should have a high Seebeck coefficient (S), high electrical conductivity (σ), and low thermal conductivity (κ). This combination of properties allows the material to efficiently convert thermal energy into electrical energy, making it suitable for thermoelectric applications such as power generation and cooling."
