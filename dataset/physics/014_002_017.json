    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is the residual thermal radiation that fills the entire universe and is a remnant from the early stages of the universe, shortly after the Big Bang. It was first discovered in 1964 by astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery in 1978.\n\nThe CMBR is a nearly uniform glow of microwave radiation that comes from all directions in space. It has a temperature of approximately 2.725 Kelvin, which corresponds to the blackbody radiation spectrum. This radiation is a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.\n\nThe Big Bang theory posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense state, and has been expanding and cooling ever since. Roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This event is known as the epoch of recombination. Before this time, the universe was filled with a hot, dense plasma of charged particles that scattered photons, making it opaque. Once the recombination occurred, the universe became transparent, and the photons were free to travel through space.\n\nThese photons, which were once in thermal equilibrium with the hot plasma, have been cooling and stretching as the universe expands. Today, they form the CMBR that we observe. The CMBR provides strong evidence for the Big Bang theory because its properties, such as its nearly uniform temperature and blackbody spectrum, are consistent with the predictions of the theory.\n\nFurthermore, the CMBR also contains tiny fluctuations in temperature, known as anisotropies, which are believed to be the seeds of the large-scale structures (galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc.) that we see in the universe today. These anisotropies have been extensively studied by various satellite missions, such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the Planck satellite. The data from these missions have provided strong support for the Big Bang theory and have helped refine our understanding of the universe's age, composition, and evolution."
