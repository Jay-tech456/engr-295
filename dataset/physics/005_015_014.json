    "message_1": "A spaceship travelling at a velocity of 0.8c relative to Earth releases a probe. If the probe is designed to accelerate at a rate of 2g (where g=9.8 m/s^2) in the spaceship's frame of reference, what acceleration will be observed from Earth's frame of reference? What will be the maximum speed the probe will attain according to Earth?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relativistic acceleration and velocity addition. \n\nFirst, let's find the proper acceleration (acceleration in the spaceship's frame of reference) of the probe. The probe is designed to accelerate at a rate of 2g, where g = 9.8 m/s^2:\n\nProper acceleration (a') = 2g = 2 * 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 m/s^2\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration observed from Earth's frame of reference (a). We can use the following formula for relativistic acceleration:\n\na = a' / (γ^3)\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which can be calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nHere, v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth (0.8c), and c is the speed of light. Let's calculate γ:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 = 5/3\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration observed from Earth's frame of reference:\n\na = 19.6 m/s^2 / (γ^3) = 19.6 m/s^2 / ((5/3)^3) = 19.6 m/s^2 / (125/27) = (19.6 * 27) / 125 = 5.2992 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration observed from Earth's frame of reference is approximately 5.2992 m/s^2.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum speed the probe will attain according to Earth. Since the probe is accelerating indefinitely, it will approach the speed of light, but never actually reach it due to the laws of special relativity. However, we can find the effective speed of the probe relative to Earth using the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (v + a') / (1 + (v * a')/c^2)\n\nwhere u is the effective speed of the probe relative to Earth, v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth (0.8c), and a' is the proper acceleration of the probe (19.6 m/s^2). Let's calculate u:\n\nu = (0.8c + 19.6 m/s^2) / (1 + (0.8c * 19.6 m/s^2)/c^2)\n\nSince the probe's acceleration is much smaller than the speed of light, the term (0.8c * 19.6 m/s^2)/c^2 is negligible. Therefore, the effective speed of the probe relative to Earth is approximately:\n\nu ≈ 0.8c\n\nSo, the maximum speed the probe will attain according to Earth is approximately 0.8 times the speed of light."
