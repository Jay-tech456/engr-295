    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is triangular, we can divide it into three segments, and the magnetic field at point P will be the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each segment. Let's consider one segment of the triangle and find the magnetic field due to it.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, and let's consider the segment AB. We can find the midpoint M of the segment AB, which will be at a distance of 5 cm from point P (since P is perpendicular to the bisector). The angle between the segment AB and the line PM can be found using the properties of an equilateral triangle:\n\nangle(PMA) = angle(PMB) = 180° - 60° = 120°\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field due to the segment AB using the Biot-Savart Law. We will integrate the expression for dB along the length of the segment AB:\n\nB_AB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nLet's denote the angle between dl and r as θ. Since dl and r are not parallel, we can write the cross product dl x r as:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(θ)\n\nIn our case, θ = 120°, so sin(θ) = sin(120°) = sin(180° - 60°) = sin(60°) = √3 / 2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression for B_AB:\n\nB_AB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * ∫(dl * r * sin(θ)) / r³)\n\nThe integral will be taken along the length of the segment AB. Since r is constant (5 cm) along the length of the segment, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB_AB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (√3 / 2) * ∫dl / r²)\n\nThe integral of dl along the length of the segment AB is just the length of the segment, which is 10 cm:\n\nB_AB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (√3 / 2) * 10 cm / (5 cm)²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for μ₀ and I:\n\nB_AB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A / 4π) * (2 A * (√3 / 2) * 10 cm / (5 cm)²)\nB_AB = 10^(-7) T * (√3 * 20 cm / 25 cm²)\nB_AB = 10^(-7) T * (20√3 / 25) T\n\nSince the triangle is symmetrical, the magnetic fields due to the other two segments (BC and CA) will have the same magnitude as B_AB, and their directions will be such that they add up to give the total magnetic field at point P. Therefore, the total magnetic field at point P is:\n\nB_P = 3 * B_AB = 3 * 10^(-7) T * (20√3 / 25) T\nB_P ≈ 1.24 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.24 × 10^(-6) T."
