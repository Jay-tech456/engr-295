    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm, we need to use the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) values for CH4, CO2, H2O, and O2. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for the reaction can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants)\n\nUsing the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation values at 298 K:\n\nΔGf°(CH4) = -50.8 kJ/mol\nΔGf°(CO2) = -394.4 kJ/mol\nΔGf°(H2O) = -228.6 kJ/mol\nΔGf°(O2) = 0 kJ/mol (since O2 is in its standard state)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔG = [1 × (-394.4) + 2 × (-228.6)] - [1 × (-50.8) + 2 × 0]\n\nΔG = (-394.4 - 457.2) - (-50.8)\n\nΔG = -851.6 + 50.8\n\nΔG = -800.8 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane gas (CH4) at 298 K and 1 atm is -800.8 kJ/mol."
