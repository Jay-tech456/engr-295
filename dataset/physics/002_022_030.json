    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient, we first need to determine the theoretical osmotic pressure using the van't Hoff equation:\n\nπ = i * c * R * T\n\nwhere π is the osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor, c is the concentration of the solution, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven the values:\ni = 1.88\nc = 0.2 M\nR = 0.082 L·atm/K·mol\nT = 298 K\n\nWe can calculate the theoretical osmotic pressure:\n\nπ_theoretical = 1.88 * 0.2 * 0.082 * 298\nπ_theoretical = 9.20304 atm\n\nNow, we can calculate the activity coefficient (γ) using the ratio of the experimental osmotic pressure (π_experimental) to the theoretical osmotic pressure (π_theoretical):\n\nγ = π_experimental / π_theoretical\n\nGiven the experimental osmotic pressure is 3.65 atm:\n\nγ = 3.65 / 9.20304\nγ ≈ 0.3967\n\nThe activity coefficient of the 0.2 M solution of sodium chloride at 298 K is approximately 0.3967."
