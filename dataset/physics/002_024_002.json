    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n- P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively\n- ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization\n- R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which is equal to 40700 J/mol. We need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C (T2), which is equal to 298.15 K. We can use the known vapor pressure of water at 100°C (373.15 K) as a reference point (P1 = 101325 Pa, T1 = 373.15 K).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -40700/8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp(-40700/8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 3169.7 Pa\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately 3169.7 Pa."
