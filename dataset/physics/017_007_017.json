    "message_2": "A topological insulator is a material that behaves as an insulator in its bulk but has conducting states on its surface or edges. The mathematical criterion for determining if a material is a topological insulator is based on its topological invariants, which are derived from the electronic band structure of the material.\n\nThe topological invariant is a number that characterizes the global properties of the band structure and remains unchanged under continuous deformations of the system. For a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator, the topological invariant is the Chern number, while for a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator, the topological invariant is the Z2 invariant.\n\nThe Chern number is an integer that is calculated from the Berry curvature of the occupied bands in the Brillouin zone. If the Chern number is non-zero, the material is a 2D topological insulator, also known as a quantum Hall insulator. The Z2 invariant is a binary number (0 or 1) that is calculated from the time-reversal symmetry of the band structure. If the Z2 invariant is non-trivial (1), the material is a 3D topological insulator.\n\nThe electronic properties of topological insulators are characterized by the presence of gapless surface or edge states that are protected by topological invariants. These states are robust against local perturbations and impurities, which makes them ideal for applications in quantum computing and spintronics.\n\nTopological semimetals, on the other hand, are materials that have a band structure with accidental touching points between the conduction and valence bands. These touching points are called Dirac or Weyl nodes, depending on the presence or absence of a net Berry flux. The electronic properties of topological semimetals differ from those of topological insulators in that they exhibit both metallic and insulating behavior.\n\nIn topological semimetals, the bulk of the material is metallic due to the presence of the Dirac or Weyl nodes, while the surface or edge states can exhibit insulating behavior. These materials are of great interest due to their unique electronic properties, such as extremely high electron mobility and unconventional quantum Hall effects.\n\nIn summary, the mathematical criterion for determining a topological insulator is based on its topological invariants, which are derived from the band structure of the material. Topological semimetals differ from topological insulators in that they exhibit both metallic and insulating behavior due to the presence of Dirac or Weyl nodes in their band structure."
