    "message_1": "A current of 2 A flows through a helix coil of 10 turns with a radius of 0.05 meters. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the helix coil.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the helix coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nSince we are calculating the magnetic field at the center of the helix coil, x = 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * R³)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 turns * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * (0.05 m)³)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 turns * 0.0025 m²) / (0.000125 m³)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 turns * 0.0025 m²) / (0.000125 m³)\n\nB ≈ (25.13 × 10^(-7) T * 0.0025 m²) / (0.000125 m³)\n\nB ≈ 0.0005026 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the helix coil is approximately 0.0005026 Tesla."
