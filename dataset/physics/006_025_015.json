    "message_2": "In the nuclear fission of uranium-235, the energy released comes from the binding energy difference between the initial nucleus and the fission products. The fission of uranium-235 typically produces two fission fragments, such as krypton-92 and barium-141, along with a few neutrons. The total energy released in this process is approximately 200 MeV.\n\nTo find the energy released per nucleon, we can divide the total energy by the number of nucleons in the uranium-235 nucleus:\n\nEnergy per nucleon (fission) = (200 MeV) / (235 nucleons) ≈ 0.85 MeV/nucleon\n\nNow, let's consider the fusion of a deuteron (D) with a triton (T). The reaction can be represented as:\n\nD + T → He-4 + n\n\nThe energy released in this reaction is approximately 17.6 MeV. Since there are 5 nucleons involved in the reaction (2 from the deuteron and 3 from the triton), we can calculate the energy released per nucleon:\n\nEnergy per nucleon (fusion) = (17.6 MeV) / (5 nucleons) ≈ 3.52 MeV/nucleon\n\nComparing the two values, we can see that the energy released per nucleon in the fusion of deuteron with triton (3.52 MeV/nucleon) is significantly higher than the energy released per nucleon in the nuclear fission of uranium-235 (0.85 MeV/nucleon). This is one of the reasons why nuclear fusion has the potential to be a more efficient and cleaner energy source than nuclear fission."
