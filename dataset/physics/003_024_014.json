    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from a current carrying inductor with 100 turns that carries a current of 2 A. The inductor has a length of 20 cm and a radius of 5 cm. What is the magnetic field strength at the given distance from the center of the inductor?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor, we can use Ampere's Law in the form of the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) at a point due to a current element is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dL × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dL is the infinitesimal length of the current element, and r is the distance from the current element to the point where we want to calculate the magnetic field.\n\nSince we have a solenoid (inductor) with 100 turns, we need to consider the contribution of each turn to the magnetic field. The magnetic field at a point on the axis of the solenoid can be approximated as:\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of turns per unit length.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = total number of turns / length of the solenoid\nn = 100 turns / 20 cm = 100 turns / 0.2 m = 500 turns/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength (B) at the center of the solenoid:\n\nB_center = (μ₀ * n * I) / 2\nB_center = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 turns/m * 2 A) / 2\nB_center = 1π × 10^(-3) T = 3.14 × 10^(-3) T\n\nTo find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from the center of the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field on the axis of a solenoid:\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + (x + L/2)^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the solenoid, L is the length of the solenoid, and x is the distance from the center of the solenoid.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 turns/m * 2 A * (0.05 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.05 m)^2 + (0.1 m + 0.2 m / 2)^2)^(3/2))\nB = (1π × 10^(-3) T * (0.05 m)^2) / ((0.05 m)^2 + (0.2 m)^2)^(3/2)\nB ≈ 1.25 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the inductor is approximately 1.25 × 10^(-4) T."
