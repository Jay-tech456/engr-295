    "message_2": "To calculate the redshift experienced by electromagnetic radiation due to the gravitational potential, we can use the formula for gravitational redshift:\n\nz = (Δν/ν) = (Δλ/λ) = (ΔE/E) = (Δφ/c^2)\n\nwhere z is the redshift, Δν is the change in frequency, ν is the initial frequency, Δλ is the change in wavelength, λ is the initial wavelength, ΔE is the change in energy, E is the initial energy, Δφ is the gravitational potential difference, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, we are given the gravitational potential (Δφ) as 2 × 10^16 J/kg, and we need to find the redshift (z). The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nz = (Δφ/c^2)\nz = (2 × 10^16 J/kg) / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nz = (2 × 10^16 J/kg) / (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nz = 2/9\n\nz ≈ 0.222\n\nThe amount of redshift experienced by electromagnetic radiation when it is emitted from a massive object with a gravitational potential of 2 × 10^16 J/kg and observed at a distance of 10,000 km from the object's surface is approximately 0.222."
