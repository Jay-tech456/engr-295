    "message_2": "Dark matter plays a significant role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe and affects the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is the relic radiation from the early universe, and its temperature anisotropies provide a snapshot of the distribution of matter and energy at the time of its last scattering, around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nDark matter interacts gravitationally with visible matter and radiation, and its presence influences the evolution of density perturbations in the early universe. These perturbations eventually lead to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The temperature anisotropies in the CMB are directly related to these density perturbations.\n\nThe primary way dark matter affects the CMB temperature anisotropy is through its impact on the growth of these density perturbations. Dark matter provides additional gravitational potential wells that enhance the growth of perturbations, leading to more pronounced temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This effect is particularly noticeable on smaller angular scales, corresponding to the acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum.\n\nThe CMB power spectrum, which shows the amplitude of temperature fluctuations as a function of angular scale, is a powerful tool for measuring the cosmological parameters, including the amount of dark matter in the universe. By analyzing the CMB power spectrum, scientists can infer the density of dark matter and its contribution to the total energy density of the universe, usually expressed as the dark matter density parameter (Î©_dm).\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter affects the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation by influencing the growth of density perturbations in the early universe. By analyzing the CMB power spectrum, scientists can measure the amount of dark matter in the universe and better understand its role in the formation of large-scale structures."
