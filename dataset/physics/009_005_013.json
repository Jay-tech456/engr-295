    "message_2": "To calculate the image distance, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and u = -30 cm (object distance is negative for a concave mirror).\n\n1/20 = 1/(-30) + 1/v\n\nTo find v, we can solve for it:\n\n1/v = 1/20 + 1/30\n1/v = (3 + 2) / 60\n1/v = 5/60\nv = 60/5\nv = 12 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 12 cm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnification (M) using the formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -12 / (-30)\nM = 12/30\nM = 2/5\n\nThe magnification is 2/5 or 0.4.\n\nSince the magnification is positive and less than 1, the image is upright and diminished (smaller than the object). The nature of the image is virtual and erect."
