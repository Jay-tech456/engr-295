    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor has two plates each with an area of 20 cm² separated by a distance of 3 mm. A current of 5 A flows through the capacitor. Find the magnetic field strength at a point located halfway between the plates.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at a point located halfway between the plates, we can use Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\nArea of each plate (A) = 20 cm² = 20 × 10⁻⁴ m²\nDistance between the plates (d) = 3 mm = 3 × 10⁻³ m\nCurrent (I) = 5 A\n\nNow, let's consider a rectangular loop with one side parallel to the plates and the other side perpendicular to the plates. The length of the parallel side (l) is equal to the distance between the plates (d), and the length of the perpendicular side (w) is equal to the width of the plates.\n\nThe magnetic field (B) is parallel to the sides of the loop that are perpendicular to the plates, and the magnetic field is zero along the sides of the loop that are parallel to the plates. Therefore, the closed line integral of the magnetic field around the loop is:\n\n∮B⋅dl = B × w\n\nSince the loop encloses half of the current flowing through the capacitor, the enclosed current (I_enclosed) is:\n\nI_enclosed = I / 2 = 5 A / 2 = 2.5 A\n\nNow, we can apply Ampere's law:\n\nB × w = μ₀ × I_enclosed\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A. Solving for the magnetic field strength (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ × I_enclosed) / w\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A × 2.5 A) / (20 × 10⁻⁴ m)\n\nB ≈ 1.57 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength at a point located halfway between the plates is approximately 1.57 × 10⁻⁶ T."
