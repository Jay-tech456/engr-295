    "message_2": "In a free quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) is a powerful tool that allows us to express the product of two local operators at different points in spacetime as a sum of local operators at a single point. This is particularly useful for understanding the short-distance behavior of the fields.\n\nConsider two scalar fields φ(x) and φ(y) in a free quantum field theory. The OPE of these fields can be written as:\n\nφ(x)φ(y) = ∑_n C_n(x-y) O_n(y),\n\nwhere C_n(x-y) are the OPE coefficients, which depend on the difference between the spacetime points x and y, and O_n(y) are local operators at point y.\n\nIn a free theory, the scalar fields do not interact, and the OPE simplifies to:\n\nφ(x)φ(y) = C_0(x-y) φ(y),\n\nwhere C_0(x-y) is the only non-zero OPE coefficient, and it is given by the two-point correlation function of the scalar fields:\n\nC_0(x-y) = <0|φ(x)φ(y)|0> = 1/(4π^2 (x-y)^2),\n\nwhere |0> is the vacuum state.\n\nThe singular behavior of the fields at short distances can be seen from the OPE coefficient C_0(x-y). As the distance between x and y approaches zero, i.e., (x-y)^2 -> 0, the coefficient C_0(x-y) diverges, indicating that the fields have singular behavior at short distances.\n\nNow, let's derive the anomalous dimension of a scalar field operator in the free quantum field theory. The anomalous dimension is a measure of how the scaling dimension of an operator deviates from its classical dimension due to quantum effects. In a free theory, there are no interactions, and hence no quantum corrections to the scaling dimension. Therefore, the anomalous dimension of a scalar field operator in a free quantum field theory is zero.\n\nIn summary, the operator product expansion of two scalar fields in a free quantum field theory simplifies to a single term involving the two-point correlation function, which reveals the singular behavior of the fields at short distances. The anomalous dimension of a scalar field operator in the free theory is zero, as there are no quantum corrections to the scaling dimension."
