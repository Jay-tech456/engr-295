    "message_2": "The presence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of a galaxy is directly related to the formation and activity of a quasar. A quasar, short for \"quasi-stellar radio source,\" is an extremely bright and distant active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by the accretion of matter onto a SMBH.\n\nThe physics behind this relationship involves the following processes:\n\n1. Accretion of matter: As the SMBH at the center of a galaxy attracts nearby gas, dust, and stars, an accretion disk forms around it. The accretion disk consists of this matter spiraling inward towards the black hole due to its immense gravitational pull.\n\n2. Heating and radiation: As the matter in the accretion disk spirals closer to the SMBH, it becomes compressed and heated due to the intense gravitational forces. This heating causes the matter to emit electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, including visible light, X-rays, and radio waves.\n\n3. Formation of jets: In some cases, the intense magnetic fields generated by the rotating SMBH and the accretion disk can cause a portion of the infalling matter to be ejected in the form of high-speed jets. These jets are emitted perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disk and can extend for thousands of light-years.\n\n4. Quasar activity: The combination of the emitted radiation from the accretion disk and the powerful jets results in the formation of a quasar. Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe, often outshining their host galaxies. The brightness of a quasar is primarily due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into radiation as matter falls into the SMBH.\n\nThe relationship between a SMBH and a quasar is thus based on the processes of accretion, heating, radiation, and jet formation. The SMBH provides the gravitational force necessary to attract and compress matter, which in turn powers the quasar's intense luminosity and activity."
