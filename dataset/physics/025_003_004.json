    "message_2": "To calculate the electric potential required to open a sodium ion channel, we can use the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation relates the equilibrium potential (E) for an ion to its concentrations inside and outside the cell, as well as the temperature (T) and the ion's charge (z).\n\nThe Nernst equation is:\n\nE = (RT/zF) * ln([X_out]/[X_in])\n\nwhere:\n- E is the equilibrium potential\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (physiological temperature is 37°C, which is 310.15 K)\n- z is the charge of the ion (for sodium, z = +1)\n- F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)\n- [X_out] is the concentration of the ion outside the cell\n- [X_in] is the concentration of the ion inside the cell\n\nFor sodium ions, the typical concentrations are:\n- [Na_out] = 145 mM (outside the cell)\n- [Na_in] = 12 mM (inside the cell)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE_Na = (8.314 * 310.15 / (1 * 96485)) * ln(145/12)\nE_Na ≈ 0.0267 * ln(145/12)\nE_Na ≈ 0.0267 * 2.975\nE_Na ≈ 0.0794 V\n\nTherefore, the electric potential required to open a sodium ion channel with a diameter of 0.5 nm, assuming the temperature and ion concentrations are at physiological levels, is approximately 79.4 mV."
