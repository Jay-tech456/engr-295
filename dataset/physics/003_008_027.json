    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of length L and width W carries a current of 5 A. Determine the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the sheet and lying on the perpendicular bisector of the sheet.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the sheet is rectangular and carries a uniform current, we can consider the current to be distributed along the length L in the form of thin current-carrying wires. Let's divide the sheet into N thin strips, each carrying a current dI = 5 A / N. The width of each strip is dW = W / N.\n\nNow, let's consider a small current element at a distance x from the perpendicular bisector of the sheet. The distance from this current element to point P is given by:\n\nr = sqrt(x² + (2 cm)²)\n\nThe angle θ between the current element and the position vector r is 90 degrees, as the current flows along the length of the sheet and r is perpendicular to the sheet. Therefore, the cross product dl x r simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(θ) = dl * r * sin(90°) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can write the magnetic field dB due to this small current element:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r) / r³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire width of the sheet, we get the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫[(dI * dl * r) / r³] dx from -W/2 to W/2\n\nSince dI, dl, and μ₀ are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * dI * dl / 4π) * ∫[r / r³] dx from -W/2 to W/2\n\nThe integral simplifies to:\n\nB = (μ₀ * dI * dl / 4π) * ∫[1 / r²] dx from -W/2 to W/2\n\nNow, we substitute dI = 5 A / N and dl = W / N:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A / N * W / N / 4π) * ∫[1 / r²] dx from -W/2 to W/2\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use a substitution: let u = r, so du = dx. The integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A / N * W / N / 4π) * ∫[1 / u²] du from -W/2 to W/2\n\nThe integral of 1/u² is -1/u, so we have:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A / N * W / N / 4π) * [-1/u] from -W/2 to W/2\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A / N * W / N / 4π) * [-1/(W/2 + 2 cm) + 1/(-W/2 + 2 cm)]\n\nNow, we need to take the limit as N approaches infinity:\n\nB = lim (N→∞) (μ₀ * 5 A / N * W / N / 4π) * [-1/(W/2 + 2 cm) + 1/(-W/2 + 2 cm)]\n\nThis limit converges to:\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A * W / 4π) * [-1/(W/2 + 2 cm) + 1/(-W/2 + 2 cm)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of μ₀:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * W / 4π) * [-1/(W/2 + 2 cm) + 1/(-W/2 + 2 cm)]\n\nThe π's cancel out, and we're left with:\n\nB = (10^(-7) Tm * 5 A * W) * [-1/(W/2 + 2 cm) + 1/(-W/2 + 2 cm)]\n\nThis is the magnetic field at point P located at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the rectangular sheet and lying on the perpendicular bisector of the sheet. Note that the result depends on the width W of the sheet."
