    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the current-carrying wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nGiven:\nI = 2.5 A\nR = 0.1 m\nx = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (10^(-6)π Tm² * 2.5 A * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (7.85 × 10^(-8) Tm² * 2.5 A) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ (1.9625 × 10^(-7) T) / (2 * 0.00035355 m³/2)\n\nB ≈ (1.9625 × 10^(-7) T) / (7.071 × 10^(-5) m³/2)\n\nB ≈ 2.775 × 10^(-3) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 0.05 meters from the current-carrying wire is approximately 2.775 × 10^(-3) T (tesla)."
