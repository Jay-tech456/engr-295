    "message_2": "To calculate the change in entropy (ΔS) of the aluminum block, we can use the formula:\n\nΔS = mcΔT * ln(T2/T1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the block, c is the specific heat capacity, ΔT is the change in temperature, T1 is the initial temperature, and T2 is the final temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 50 g\nc = 0.9 J/g°C\nT1 = 20°C\nT2 = 80°C\n\nFirst, let's find the change in temperature (ΔT):\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 80°C - 20°C = 60°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy (ΔS):\n\nΔS = (50 g)(0.9 J/g°C)(60°C) * ln(80°C/20°C)\n\nΔS = (50)(0.9)(60) * ln(4)\n\nΔS = 2700 J/°C * ln(4)\n\nΔS ≈ 2700 J/°C * 1.386\n\nΔS ≈ 3742 J/K\n\nThe change in entropy of the aluminum block is approximately 3742 J/K."
