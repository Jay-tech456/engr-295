    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nV = (V1 + V2) / (1 + (V1 * V2) / c^2)\n\nwhere V is the velocity of spaceship X relative to Earth, V1 is the velocity of spaceship S relative to Earth (0.6c), V2 is the velocity of spaceship X relative to spaceship S (0.8c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV = (0.6c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c) / c^2)\n\nV = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nV = 1.4c / 1.48\n\nV â‰ˆ 0.946c\n\nSo the velocity of spaceship X as seen by Earth is approximately 0.946c."
