    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outer space that travel at nearly the speed of light and constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere. They consist mainly of protons, electrons, and atomic nuclei. When these particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere, they can have various effects on temperature, pressure, and electrical conductivity at different altitudes.\n\n1. Temperature: Cosmic rays can influence the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere indirectly. When they interact with the atmosphere, they produce secondary particles, such as muons, neutrons, and other subatomic particles. These secondary particles can ionize the air molecules, leading to the formation of aerosols. Aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei, which can affect cloud formation and, in turn, influence the Earth's temperature. However, the overall impact of cosmic rays on atmospheric temperature is still a subject of ongoing research and debate among scientists.\n\n2. Pressure: The effect of cosmic rays on atmospheric pressure is relatively small. The energy deposited by cosmic rays in the atmosphere is negligible compared to the energy from the Sun and other sources. Therefore, cosmic rays do not significantly influence the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n3. Electrical conductivity: Cosmic rays have a more pronounced effect on the electrical conductivity of the Earth's atmosphere. As they interact with air molecules, they produce ionization, which results in the formation of free electrons and ions. This process increases the electrical conductivity of the atmosphere, especially at higher altitudes where cosmic rays are more intense. The ionosphere, a region of the Earth's upper atmosphere (about 60-1000 km altitude), is particularly affected by cosmic rays, as it contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons, which play a crucial role in radio wave propagation and other atmospheric processes.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays have a limited effect on the temperature and pressure of the Earth's atmosphere but can significantly influence its electrical conductivity, particularly at higher altitudes. The overall impact of cosmic rays on the Earth's atmosphere is still an area of active research and discussion among scientists."
