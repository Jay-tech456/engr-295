    "message_2": "The estimated abundance of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content. This is in contrast to the roughly 5% of ordinary (baryonic) matter and about 68% of dark energy. These percentages are derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structure of the universe, and the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter has evolved over time due to the influence of gravity. In the early universe, dark matter was distributed relatively uniformly. As the universe expanded and cooled, dark matter began to clump together under the influence of gravity, forming the cosmic web structure we observe today. This cosmic web consists of dark matter halos, which are regions of high dark matter density, connected by filaments of dark matter.\n\nThese dark matter halos serve as the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. As dark matter clumped together, it attracted ordinary matter, which then formed stars and galaxies within these dark matter halos. Over time, the distribution of dark matter has become more clustered and concentrated in these halos and filaments, while the voids between them have become emptier.\n\nIn summary, the estimated abundance of dark matter in the universe is about 27% of the total mass-energy content. Its distribution has evolved from a relatively uniform state in the early universe to a more clustered and concentrated state within dark matter halos and filaments, providing the gravitational framework for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters."
