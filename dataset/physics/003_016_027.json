    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the given point, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of the triangle. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle:\n\ns = (a + b + c) / 2 = (2 + 3 + 4) / 2 = 4.5\nArea = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = √(4.5(2.5)(1.5)(0.5)) = 2.9047 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the height (h) of the triangle using the area and base:\n\nArea = 0.5 * base * height\n2.9047 = 0.5 * 4 * h\nh = 2.9047 / 2 = 1.4523 cm\n\nNow, let's consider the three sides of the triangle as three current-carrying wires. We will find the magnetic field due to each side and then add them up to find the total magnetic field at the given point.\n\nLet's denote the given point as P and the midpoint of the base as M. The distance from P to M is 5 cm. Let A, B, and C be the vertices of the triangle, with AB being the base (4 cm). Let D be the midpoint of AC, so that MD is the perpendicular bisector of the base.\n\n1. Magnetic field due to side AB:\n\nSince the current in side AB is parallel to the line PM, the magnetic field due to this side will be zero at point P.\n\n2. Magnetic field due to side AC:\n\nWe can find the angle θ between side AC and the line PM using the sine rule:\n\nsin(θ) = h / 3\nθ = arcsin(h / 3) = arcsin(1.4523 / 3) = 29.4985°\n\nNow, we can find the distance from point P to side AC using the sine rule:\n\nx = 5 * sin(θ) = 5 * sin(29.4985°) = 2.4264 cm\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field due to side AC using the formula for a straight current-carrying wire:\n\nB_AC = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * x) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 2.4264 cm) = 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field due to side AC is clockwise when viewed from point P.\n\n3. Magnetic field due to side BC:\n\nThe angle between side BC and the line PM is the same as the angle between side AC and the line PM (θ = 29.4985°). The distance from point P to side BC is also the same as the distance from point P to side AC (x = 2.4264 cm).\n\nSo, the magnetic field due to side BC is the same as the magnetic field due to side AC:\n\nB_BC = 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field due to side BC is counterclockwise when viewed from point P.\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at point P by adding the magnetic fields due to the three sides:\n\nB_total = B_AB + B_AC + B_BC = 0 + 10⁻⁷ T - 10⁻⁷ T = 0 T\n\nThe magnetic field at point P is 0 T."
