    "message_2": "Gravitinos are hypothetical particles that arise in the context of supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. As potential dark matter candidates, gravitinos have a wide range of predicted masses, depending on the specific supersymmetric model and its parameters.\n\nIn general, the mass range for gravitinos can span from a few eV (electron volts) to several TeV (tera-electron volts). If gravitinos make up the majority of dark matter in the universe, their mass is expected to be in the keV (kilo-electron volt) to GeV (giga-electron volt) range. This is because lighter gravitinos would overproduce dark matter, while heavier gravitinos would lead to an overproduction of other supersymmetric particles that have not been observed.\n\nNow let's compare this to other proposed dark matter particles:\n\n1. WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles): WIMPs are among the most well-studied dark matter candidates. They are expected to have masses in the range of 10 GeV to a few TeV. This mass range is similar to the upper end of the gravitino mass range. However, WIMPs interact via the weak nuclear force, while gravitinos interact via gravitational interactions, which are much weaker.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. As dark matter candidates, axions are expected to have extremely small masses, typically in the range of 10^-6 eV to 10^-3 eV. This mass range is much lighter than both gravitinos and WIMPs.\n\nIn summary, the predicted mass range for gravitinos as dark matter candidates is quite broad, spanning from keV to GeV. This range overlaps with the mass range of WIMPs but is much heavier than the mass range of axions. However, it is important to note that the existence of gravitinos, as well as WIMPs and axions, is still hypothetical, and their properties, including their masses, depend on the specific theoretical models being considered."
