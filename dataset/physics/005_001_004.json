    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.6c (where c is the speed of light) relative to the Earth. It has an onboard clock that measures time intervals. If Earth observers measure that 10 seconds have passed, how much time has passed on the spaceship according to the onboard clock? Solve the problem using time dilation formula.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the time dilation formula from the theory of special relativity. The formula is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\n\nwhere Δt is the time interval measured by Earth observers (10 seconds), Δt' is the time interval measured by the spaceship's onboard clock, and γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.6c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor γ:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ = 1 / √(0.64)\nγ = 1 / 0.8\nγ ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation formula to find the time interval Δt' measured by the spaceship's onboard clock:\n\nΔt' = Δt / γ\nΔt' = 10 s / 1.25\nΔt' ≈ 8 s\n\nSo, according to the spaceship's onboard clock, approximately 8 seconds have passed."
