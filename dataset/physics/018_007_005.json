    "message_2": "In a simplified version of a supersymmetric theory, the difference in mass between the superpartner of the electron (selectron) and the electron itself cannot be explicitly determined without additional information about the specific model and its parameters. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical framework that predicts the existence of superpartners for each known particle, with the superpartners differing in their spin by 1/2 unit.\n\nThe mass difference between the selectron and the electron depends on the SUSY breaking mechanism and the parameters of the specific SUSY model. In general, the superpartners are expected to be heavier than their Standard Model counterparts. However, the exact mass difference can vary significantly depending on the model and its parameters.\n\nTo determine the mass difference between the selectron and the electron in a specific supersymmetric model, one would need to know the details of the SUSY breaking mechanism and the values of the relevant parameters. Then, using the equations of the model, the mass of the selectron can be calculated, and the mass difference can be found by subtracting the mass of the electron (approximately 0.511 MeV/cÂ²)."
