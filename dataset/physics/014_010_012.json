    "message_2": "The Schwarzschild radius (r_s) of a black hole is given by the formula:\n\nr_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, a black hole with a mass of 4 solar masses has a mass of:\n\nM = 4 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 7.956 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nr_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (7.956 x 10^30 kg)) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nr_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (7.956 x 10^30)) / (9 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ (1.3348 x 10^-10) * (7.956 x 10^30) / (9 x 10^16)\n\nr_s ≈ 1.062 x 10^21 / 9 x 10^16\n\nr_s ≈ 1.18 x 10^4 m\n\nSo, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 4 solar masses is approximately 11,800 meters or 11.8 kilometers."
