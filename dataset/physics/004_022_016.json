    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two neutron stars, we need to know their masses and the orbital parameters of their inspiral phase. The distance from Earth is not directly relevant to the frequency range, but it is important for detecting the gravitational waves.\n\nLet's denote the masses of the two neutron stars as m1 and m2. The frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. The frequency increases as the neutron stars get closer and eventually merge.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves (f) can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c) of the binary system, which is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^3/5 / (m1 + m2)^1/5\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase can be approximated as:\n\nf = (96/5 * Ï€ * G * M_c / c^3)^(3/8) * (t_c - t)^(5/8)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, t_c is the time of coalescence (when the neutron stars merge), and t is the time before coalescence.\n\nAs the neutron stars get closer, the frequency of gravitational waves increases. The frequency range depends on the masses of the neutron stars and the time before coalescence. For typical neutron star masses (around 1.4 solar masses), the frequency range is roughly from a few Hz to a few kHz.\n\nIn practice, the frequency range of detectable gravitational waves from neutron star collisions is limited by the sensitivity of the detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo. These detectors are most sensitive in the range of ~10 Hz to ~1000 Hz.\n\nSo, without specific values for the masses of the neutron stars, we can only provide a rough estimate of the frequency range for gravitational waves emitted by their collision: from a few Hz to a few kHz, with the most detectable range being between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz."
