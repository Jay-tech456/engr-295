    "message_2": "The relationship between black holes and quasars is supported by several lines of evidence, including the enormous energy output of quasars, the observed motion of stars and gas near the centers of galaxies, and the presence of accretion disks around supermassive black holes.\n\n1. Energy output: Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe, emitting vast amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. This energy output is far greater than what can be accounted for by the combined light of billions of stars in a galaxy. The most widely accepted explanation for this intense energy output is the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the quasar. As matter falls into the black hole, it forms an accretion disk and heats up to extremely high temperatures, emitting radiation in the process.\n\n2. Observed motion of stars and gas: Observations of the motion of stars and gas near the centers of galaxies provide strong evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes. The high velocities of these objects can only be explained by the presence of a massive, compact object exerting a strong gravitational force. In many cases, the mass of the central object is estimated to be millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun, which is consistent with the mass of a supermassive black hole.\n\n3. Accretion disks: In many cases, quasars are observed to have accretion disks surrounding their central black holes. These disks are composed of gas and dust that are spiraling into the black hole, releasing energy in the form of radiation as they heat up due to friction and gravitational forces. The presence of these accretion disks provides further evidence for the connection between quasars and black holes.\n\nIn summary, the enormous energy output of quasars, the observed motion of stars and gas near the centers of galaxies, and the presence of accretion disks around supermassive black holes all provide strong evidence for the relationship between black holes and quasars. The energy emitted by quasars supports the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of a quasar, as the intense radiation can be explained by the process of matter falling into the black hole and forming an accretion disk."
