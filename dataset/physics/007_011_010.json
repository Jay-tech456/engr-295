    "message_2": "The maximum mass of a white dwarf star that can be formed through stellar evolution is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately 1.4 solar masses (1.4 times the mass of our Sun). This limit is derived from the balance between the electron degeneracy pressure, which supports the white dwarf against gravitational collapse, and the force of gravity trying to compress the star.\n\nThe maximum mass of a white dwarf is related to the properties of its stellar progenitor, which is the star that existed before the white dwarf was formed. Stars with initial masses less than about 8 solar masses will end their lives as white dwarfs. During the late stages of their evolution, these stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through stellar winds and planetary nebulae ejections. The remaining core, which is composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, becomes the white dwarf.\n\nThe surrounding environment can also play a role in the mass of a white dwarf. For example, if a white dwarf is part of a binary system, it can accrete mass from its companion star. If the white dwarf's mass increases and approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, it can undergo a type Ia supernova explosion, which is a thermonuclear explosion that completely destroys the white dwarf.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of a white dwarf star is determined by the Chandrasekhar limit, which is about 1.4 solar masses. The properties of the stellar progenitor and the surrounding environment can influence the mass of the white dwarf, but it cannot exceed this limit without undergoing a catastrophic event like a type Ia supernova."
