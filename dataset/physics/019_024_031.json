    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the relationship between the entropy of a black hole and the area of its event horizon is described by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. This formula states that the entropy (S) of a black hole is proportional to the area (A) of its event horizon, divided by the Planck area (l_p^2), where the Planck area is given by l_p^2 = ħG/c^3, with ħ being the reduced Planck constant, G being the gravitational constant, and c being the speed of light.\n\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is given by:\n\nS = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * ħ * G)\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis formula can be derived from several different approaches, including semiclassical gravity, string theory, and loop quantum gravity. The key idea behind this formula is the holographic principle, which states that the information content of a region of space can be encoded on a boundary surface, like the event horizon of a black hole.\n\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula can be explained mathematically as follows:\n\n1. The area of the event horizon (A) is given by A = 4 * π * r_s^2, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole, which is related to its mass (M) by r_s = 2 * G * M / c^2.\n\n2. The Planck area (l_p^2) is given by l_p^2 = ħG/c^3.\n\n3. The entropy (S) of the black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon divided by the Planck area, which can be written as S ∝ A / l_p^2.\n\n4. To obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, we introduce the proportionality constant (k_B * c^3) / (4 * ħ * G), which has the correct units of entropy and ensures that the formula is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n5. Thus, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is given by S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * ħ * G).\n\nThis formula shows that the entropy of a black hole is directly related to the area of its event horizon, and it provides a deep connection between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and general relativity."
