    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by a binary neutron star system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): The frequency of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c) and the time to coalescence (t_c) of the binary system. The chirp mass is given by:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. In this case, both have a mass of 1.4 solar masses.\n\n2. Amplitude (h): The amplitude of the gravitational waves can be estimated using the chirp mass (M_c), the distance to the binary system (D), and the time to coalescence (t_c). The amplitude is given by:\n\nh ~ (G * M_c)^(5/3) / (c^2 * D) * (π * f)^(2/3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nNow let's calculate the frequency and amplitude:\n\n1. Chirp mass:\n\nM_c = (1.4 * 1.4)^(3/5) / (1.4 + 1.4)^(1/5) ≈ 1.17 solar masses\n\n2. Frequency:\n\nIn the final stages of inspiral before merging, the time to coalescence (t_c) is very small. As t_c approaches zero, the frequency (f) approaches its maximum value, which is given by:\n\nf_max ≈ (c^3 / G * M_c)^(5/8) * (5 / 256)^(3/8)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_max ≈ (3 * 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 1.17 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^(5/8) * (5 / 256)^(3/8) ≈ 1570 Hz\n\n3. Amplitude:\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from Mpc to meters:\n\nD = 400 Mpc * (3.086 * 10^22 m/Mpc) ≈ 1.234 * 10^25 m\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nh ≈ (6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 1.17 * 1.989 * 10^30 kg)^(5/3) / (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2 * 1.234 * 10^25 m) * (π * 1570 Hz)^(2/3) ≈ 1.28 * 10^-22\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the binary neutron star system in the final stages of inspiral before merging is approximately 1570 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 1.28 * 10^-22."
