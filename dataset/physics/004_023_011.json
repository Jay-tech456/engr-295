    "message_2": "The maximum amount of energy that can be emitted in the form of gravitational waves during a black hole merger is given by the equation:\n\nE = ΔMc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted, ΔM is the mass loss during the merger, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe mass loss during the merger is related to the initial masses of the merging black holes (M1 and M2) and the final mass of the merged black hole (Mf). The mass loss can be expressed as:\n\nΔM = M1 + M2 - Mf\n\nAccording to the equations of general relativity, the maximum mass loss during a black hole merger occurs when the merging black holes have equal masses (M1 = M2) and are non-spinning. In this case, the maximum mass loss is approximately 5% of the total initial mass:\n\nΔM_max ≈ 0.05(M1 + M2)\n\nSo, the maximum energy emitted in the form of gravitational waves during a black hole merger can be calculated as:\n\nE_max = 0.05(M1 + M2)c^2\n\nThis equation shows that the maximum energy emitted in the form of gravitational waves during a black hole merger is directly proportional to the total initial mass of the merging black holes and the square of the speed of light."
