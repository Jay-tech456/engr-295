    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure at the bottom of the tank due to the weight of the water, we can use the formula:\n\nPressure (P) = ρ * g * h\n\nwhere ρ (rho) is the density of water, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the water column.\n\nThe density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³, and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². The height of the water column is given as 2.5 m.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = (1000 kg/m³) * (9.81 m/s²) * (2.5 m)\n\nP = 24525 kg m²/s² m³\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m²/s² m³, the pressure at the bottom of the tank is:\n\nP = 24525 Pa"
