    "message_2": "To calculate the total radiation resulting from the annihilation of a 10 GeV dark matter particle and its antiparticle, we need to consider the energy released during the annihilation process. In this case, the energy of the dark matter particle and its antiparticle will be completely converted into radiation energy, according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy of the dark matter particle from GeV to Joules. \n\n1 GeV = 1.602 x 10^(-10) Joules\n\nSo, 10 GeV = 10 * 1.602 x 10^(-10) Joules = 1.602 x 10^(-9) Joules\n\nSince both the dark matter particle and its antiparticle have the same energy, the total energy released during the annihilation process will be:\n\nTotal energy = 2 * 1.602 x 10^(-9) Joules = 3.204 x 10^(-9) Joules\n\nNow, let's determine if this radiation can be detected by current gamma-ray telescopes. The energy range of gamma-ray telescopes varies, but typically they can detect gamma rays with energies between 30 keV to over 100 GeV. In our case, the energy of the radiation resulting from the annihilation is 10 GeV, which falls within the detection range of gamma-ray telescopes.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that detecting such an event also depends on other factors, such as the background noise, the sensitivity of the telescope, and the distance between the telescope and the annihilation event. Since the annihilation is taking place in the center of our galaxy, which is about 26,000 light-years away from Earth, the signal would be significantly weaker by the time it reaches us. Therefore, while the energy of the radiation is within the detection range of gamma-ray telescopes, it might still be challenging to detect it due to the distance and other factors.\n\nIn conclusion, the total radiation resulting from the annihilation of a 10 GeV dark matter particle and its antiparticle is 3.204 x 10^(-9) Joules. This radiation falls within the detection range of current gamma-ray telescopes, but detecting it might be challenging due to the distance and other factors."
