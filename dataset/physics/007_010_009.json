    "message_2": "To estimate the blast radius and thermal radiation zone of a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon detonated at ground level, we can use empirical relationships derived from historical data and computer simulations. Keep in mind that these are rough estimates and can vary depending on factors such as weapon design, altitude, and local conditions.\n\n1. Blast radius: The blast radius is the distance from the point of detonation where the overpressure (the pressure above the normal atmospheric pressure) is strong enough to cause significant damage. For a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, the blast radius can be estimated using the following relationship:\n\nBlast radius (in km) ≈ 0.28 * (Yield in kilotons)^(1/3)\n\nFor a 10-kiloton weapon:\nBlast radius ≈ 0.28 * (10)^(1/3) ≈ 0.28 * 2.15 ≈ 0.6 km\n\nSo, the estimated blast radius is approximately 0.6 kilometers.\n\n2. Thermal radiation zone: The thermal radiation zone is the area where the heat from the explosion is intense enough to cause severe burns, ignite flammable materials, and cause fires. For a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, the thermal radiation zone can be estimated using the following relationship:\n\nThermal radiation zone (in km) ≈ 1.33 * (Yield in kilotons)^(1/3)\n\nFor a 10-kiloton weapon:\nThermal radiation zone ≈ 1.33 * (10)^(1/3) ≈ 1.33 * 2.15 ≈ 2.86 km\n\nSo, the estimated thermal radiation zone is approximately 2.86 kilometers.\n\nThese estimates are for a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon detonated at ground level. The blast radius and thermal radiation zone would be different for airbursts or larger/smaller yields."
