    "message_2": "The first ionization energy of an element is the energy required to remove one electron from the outermost shell of an isolated gaseous atom to form a cation. For helium, this means removing one electron from its 1s orbital.\n\nThe ionization energy of a hydrogen-like atom (an atom with only one electron) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nIonization energy (IE) = -13.6 * Z^2 / n^2 eV\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number (number of protons) and n is the principal quantum number of the electron being removed.\n\nFor helium, Z = 2 (since it has 2 protons) and n = 1 (since the electron is in the 1s orbital). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nIE (He) = -13.6 * (2^2) / (1^2) eV\nIE (He) = -13.6 * 4 eV\nIE (He) = -54.4 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is negative because energy is required to remove the electron (i.e., it's an endothermic process). To express the ionization energy as a positive value, we take the absolute value:\n\nIE (He) = 54.4 eV\n\nNow we need to convert the ionization energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) and then to joules per mole. The conversion factor is:\n\n1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, the ionization energy in joules is:\n\nIE (He) = 54.4 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV\nIE (He) ≈ 8.72 × 10^(-18) J\n\nTo convert this to joules per mole, we multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^(-1)):\n\nIE (He) = 8.72 × 10^(-18) J * 6.022 × 10^23 mol^(-1)\nIE (He) ≈ 5.25 × 10^6 J/mol\n\nSo, the first ionization energy of helium is approximately 5.25 × 10^6 J/mol."
