    "message_2": "To calculate the Auger decay rate for a helium atom in the excited state (2p) following the ionization of the 1s electron, we need to consider the probability for the electron to decay through the Auger process and the lifetime of the excited state.\n\nThe probability for the electron to decay through the Auger process is given as 0.25. The decay occurs via the M-shell, which means that an electron from the M-shell will fill the vacancy in the 1s shell, and another electron from the 2p shell will be emitted as an Auger electron.\n\nThe lifetime of the excited state can be estimated using the Einstein A coefficient, which is a measure of the probability of spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state. For helium, the A coefficient for the 2p to 1s transition is approximately 5 x 10^8 s^-1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Auger decay rate (Γ_Auger) using the following formula:\n\nΓ_Auger = P_Auger * A_coefficient\n\nwhere P_Auger is the probability for the electron to decay through the Auger process (0.25) and A_coefficient is the Einstein A coefficient for the 2p to 1s transition (5 x 10^8 s^-1).\n\nΓ_Auger = 0.25 * (5 x 10^8 s^-1) = 1.25 x 10^8 s^-1\n\nSo, the Auger decay rate for a helium atom in the excited state (2p) following the ionization of the 1s electron is approximately 1.25 x 10^8 s^-1."
