    "message_2": "The Auger transition described involves a helium atom with an initial state of $1s^2$ and a final state of $1s^12p^3$. However, this final state is not possible for a helium atom, as helium has only two electrons. A valid final state for a helium atom undergoing an Auger transition would be $1s^12s^1$ or $1s^12p^1$. \n\nAssuming the final state is $1s^12p^1$, we can calculate the probability of an Auger transition occurring and the energy of the emitted Auger electron.\n\nThe probability of an Auger transition occurring depends on the competition between radiative and non-radiative processes. In helium, the radiative process is the emission of a photon during the transition from an excited state to a lower energy state, while the non-radiative process is the Auger transition. The probability of an Auger transition occurring can be estimated using the Auger rate ($\\Gamma_A$) and the radiative rate ($\\Gamma_R$) as follows:\n\n$P_A = \\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_A + \\Gamma_R}$\n\nThe Auger and radiative rates depend on the specific atomic system and transition, and they are usually obtained from experimental data or advanced theoretical calculations. For helium, the probability of an Auger transition occurring is typically much lower than that of a radiative transition.\n\nTo calculate the energy of the emitted Auger electron, we need to consider the energy levels of the helium atom. The energy levels of the helium atom can be approximated using the following formula:\n\n$E_n = -\\frac{Z^2}{2n^2} Ry$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the nth level, Z is the atomic number (Z = 2 for helium), and Ry is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 13.6 eV). \n\nFor the initial state $1s^2$, the energy is:\n\n$E_{1s} = -\\frac{2^2}{2(1)^2} Ry = -8 Ry$\n\nFor the final state $1s^12p^1$, the energy levels are:\n\n$E_{1s} = -\\frac{2^2}{2(1)^2} Ry = -8 Ry$\n\n$E_{2p} = -\\frac{2^2}{2(2)^2} Ry = -2 Ry$\n\nThe energy difference between the initial and final states is:\n\n$\\Delta E = (E_{1s} + E_{2p}) - E_{1s} = -2 Ry$\n\nSince the energy of the emitted Auger electron is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states, the energy of the Auger electron is:\n\n$E_{Auger} = -\\Delta E = 2 Ry = 2 \\times 13.6 eV = 27.2 eV$\n\nSo, the energy of the emitted Auger electron is approximately 27.2 eV."
