    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation experienced by the observer, we need to consider both the gravitational time dilation due to the planet's mass and the time dilation due to the observer's velocity (special relativity).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the gravitational time dilation. The formula for gravitational time dilation is:\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2))\n\nwhere t' is the dilated time, t is the proper time, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the planet, r is the distance from the center of the planet, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven the problem, M = 5 x 10^24 kg, and r = 2,000 km = 2,000,000 m.\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5 x 10^24 kg) / (2,000,000 m * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2))\n\nNow, let's calculate the time dilation due to the observer's velocity (special relativity). The formula for time dilation due to velocity is:\n\nt'' = t' * sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere t'' is the total dilated time, and v is the observer's velocity.\n\nGiven the problem, v = 10,000 m/s.\n\nt'' = t' * sqrt(1 - (10,000 m/s)^2 / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nNow, we can combine the two equations:\n\nt'' = t * sqrt(1 - (2 * G * M) / (r * c^2)) * sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nBy plugging in the given values and solving for t'', we can find the time dilation experienced by the observer."
