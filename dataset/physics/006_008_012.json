    "message_2": "To calculate the work function of an atom, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\nKE = hf - Φ\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron, h is the Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the incident light, and Φ is the work function of the atom.\n\nWe are given the frequency (f) of the incident light as 3.24 x 10^14 Hz, and the kinetic energy (KE) of the ejected electron as 2.34 x 10^-18 J. The Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the work function (Φ):\n\nΦ = hf - KE\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nΦ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3.24 x 10^14 Hz) - (2.34 x 10^-18 J)\n\nΦ = (2.147 x 10^-19 J) - (2.34 x 10^-18 J)\n\nΦ = -2.1926 x 10^-18 J\n\nSince the work function cannot be negative, there must be an error in the given data or the problem statement. Please check the given values and try again."
