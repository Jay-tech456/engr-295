    "message_2": "The estimated percentage of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27%. This means that dark matter makes up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, while ordinary matter (such as stars, planets, and gas) accounts for about 5%, and dark energy accounts for the remaining 68%.\n\nThere are several methods used to measure the abundance of dark matter in the universe. Some of the most accepted methods include:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: This method involves observing the bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster. This bending effect, known as gravitational lensing, can be used to infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in the massive object.\n\n2. Galaxy rotation curves: By studying the rotation of galaxies, astronomers can determine the distribution of mass within them. Observations have shown that the rotation curves of galaxies do not follow the expected pattern based on the visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. By analyzing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can infer the distribution of matter, including dark matter, in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is influenced by the presence of dark matter. By studying the large-scale structure of the universe, scientists can learn about the properties and abundance of dark matter.\n\n5. Computer simulations: Scientists use computer simulations to model the formation and evolution of the universe, including the role of dark matter. By comparing the results of these simulations with observations of the real universe, researchers can constrain the properties and abundance of dark matter."
