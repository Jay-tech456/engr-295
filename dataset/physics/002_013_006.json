    "message_1": "A Carnot engine operating between two heat reservoirs has a hot reservoir temperature of 500 K and a cold reservoir temperature of 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs at temperatures Th (hot reservoir) and Tc (cold reservoir). The Carnot efficiency is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (Tc / Th)\n\nIn this case, the hot reservoir temperature (Th) is 500 K, and the cold reservoir temperature (Tc) is 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 500 K)\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - 0.6\n\nCarnot efficiency = 0.4\n\nSo, the Carnot efficiency of the engine is 0.4, or 40%."
