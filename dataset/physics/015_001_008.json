    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of the gravitational wave\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM = total mass of the binary system (in this case, 10 + 20 = 30 times the mass of the sun)\nω = angular frequency of the orbit\nr = separation between the black holes\nc = speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)\nD = distance from the Earth (1 billion light-years)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses and distance into SI units:\n\nMass of the sun = 1.989 × 10^30 kg\nTotal mass of the binary system (M) = 30 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 5.967 × 10^31 kg\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 × 10^15 m\nDistance from the Earth (D) = 1 billion light-years = 1 × 10^9 * (9.461 × 10^15 m) = 9.461 × 10^24 m\n\nNext, we need to estimate the angular frequency (ω) and separation (r) of the black holes. These values depend on the specific details of the binary system, such as the orbital period and eccentricity. However, we can make some assumptions to get a rough estimate.\n\nLet's assume the black holes are in a circular orbit with a period (T) of 100 seconds. The angular frequency (ω) can be calculated as:\n\nω = 2 * π / T = 2 * π / 100 s ≈ 0.06283 s^-1\n\nNow, we can use Kepler's third law to estimate the separation (r) between the black holes:\n\nT^2 = (4 * π^2 * r^3) / (G * M)\nr^3 = (T^2 * G * M) / (4 * π^2)\nr = ((T^2 * G * M) / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)\n\nr ≈ 1.98 × 10^6 m\n\nFinally, we can plug all the values into the formula for the amplitude of the gravitational wave:\n\nh ≈ (4 * (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (5.967 × 10^31 kg) * (0.06283 s^-1)^2 * (1.98 × 10^6 m)) / ((2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^4 * (9.461 × 10^24 m))\n\nh ≈ 1.27 × 10^-22\n\nSo, the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by this binary black hole system at a distance of 1 billion light-years from the Earth is approximately 1.27 × 10^-22. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual value may vary depending on the specific details of the binary system."
