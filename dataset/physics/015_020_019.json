    "message_2": "Detecting gravitational waves from binary white dwarf systems using LIGO and Virgo detectors is a challenging task. Binary white dwarf systems typically have lower masses and lower orbital frequencies compared to the binary neutron star and black hole mergers that LIGO and Virgo have detected so far. The gravitational waves emitted by binary white dwarf systems are weaker and fall in the lower end of the frequency range that LIGO and Virgo are sensitive to.\n\nTo confidently detect gravitational waves from binary white dwarf systems, we would need to observe a large number of such systems to increase the chances of detection. However, the exact number of systems needed to be observed depends on various factors, such as the sensitivity of the detectors, the distance to the systems, and the masses and orbital parameters of the white dwarfs.\n\nIt is difficult to provide a specific number of binary white dwarf systems needed for confident detection without more information about the systems and the detectors' performance. However, it is worth noting that the upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), is expected to be more sensitive to the lower frequency gravitational waves emitted by binary white dwarf systems. LISA will likely be able to detect thousands of binary white dwarf systems, significantly improving our chances of observing gravitational waves from these sources."
