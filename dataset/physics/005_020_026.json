    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of the signal received by an observer on Earth, we need to consider the Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves. The Doppler effect causes a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (c / (c + v))\n\nwhere:\nf_observed is the frequency observed by the observer on Earth,\nf_source is the frequency of the source (10 MHz),\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s),\nand v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to the observer (0.6c).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the observed frequency:\n\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s + 0.6 * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s + 1.8 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.8 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nf_observed = (10 x 10^6 Hz) * 0.625\n\nf_observed = 6.25 x 10^6 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the signal received by an observer on Earth is 6.25 MHz."
