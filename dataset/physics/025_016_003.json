    "message_2": "The reaction catalyzed by hexokinase can be represented as follows:\n\nGlucose + ATP → Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for this reaction under standard conditions can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)\n\nwhere ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), and Q is the reaction quotient.\n\nFor the hexokinase reaction, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is approximately -16.7 kJ/mol. Since we are considering standard conditions (1 M concentrations), the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to 1, and the natural logarithm of 1 is 0. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔG = ΔG°\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy for the hexokinase reaction under standard conditions is approximately -16.7 kJ/mol.\n\nThe significance of this value in determining the feasibility of the reaction in living cells is that a negative ΔG indicates that the reaction is spontaneous and energetically favorable. In other words, the reaction will proceed in the direction of glucose phosphorylation to form glucose-6-phosphate. This is important for living cells, as glucose-6-phosphate is a key intermediate in various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway."
