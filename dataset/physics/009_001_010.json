    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of the medium, we can use the formula derived from Snell's Law. First, let's define the variables:\n\nn1 = refractive index of the first medium (air) = 1 (since air has a refractive index very close to 1)\nn2 = refractive index of the second medium (the medium we want to find)\ni = angle of incidence\nr1 = angle of refraction at the first surface\nr2 = angle of refraction at the second surface\nA = angle of the prism\nD = angle of deviation\n\nSnell's Law states that n1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r1) for the first surface and n2 * sin(r2) = n1 * sin(i') for the second surface, where i' is the angle of emergence.\n\nFrom geometry, we know that A = r1 + r2 and D = i + i' - A.\n\nNow, we need to eliminate r1 and r2 from the equations to find the refractive index n2.\n\nFirst, we can write r1 = A - r2. Then, we can substitute this into Snell's Law for the first surface:\n\nn1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(A - r2)\n\nNow, we can use the second surface's Snell's Law equation to solve for r2:\n\nr2 = arcsin((n1 * sin(i')) / n2)\n\nSubstitute this expression for r2 back into the first surface's equation:\n\nn1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(A - arcsin((n1 * sin(i')) / n2))\n\nNow, we can solve for n2:\n\nn2 = n1 * sin(i) / sin(A - arcsin((n1 * sin(i')) / n2))\n\nSince we have the angle of incidence (i), angle of deviation (D), and angle of the prism (A), we can solve for the angle of emergence (i') using the geometry equation:\n\ni' = D + A - i\n\nNow, we have all the necessary information to solve for the refractive index n2 using the equation above. Plug in the given values for i, D, and A, and solve for n2."
