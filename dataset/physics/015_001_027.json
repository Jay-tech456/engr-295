    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave strain amplitude. The formula is given by:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω^2 * r) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere:\n- h is the gravitational wave strain amplitude\n- G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the total mass of the binary black hole system (M = m1 + m2, where m1 and m2 are the masses of the individual black holes)\n- ω is the angular frequency of the binary system (ω = 2 * π * f, where f is the orbital frequency)\n- r is the separation distance between the two black holes\n- c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n- D is the distance from the binary black hole system to the observer\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system using the masses and distance of the black holes, you would need to determine the total mass of the system (M), the separation distance between the black holes (r), and the distance from the system to the observer (D). Additionally, you would need to determine the orbital frequency (f) of the binary system, which can be calculated using Kepler's third law:\n\nf = (1 / (2 * π)) * √(G * M / r^3)\n\nOnce you have all the necessary parameters, you can plug them into the quadrupole formula to calculate the gravitational wave strain amplitude (h)."
