    "message_2": "The maximum energy a cosmic ray particle can have before it becomes too dangerous for human space travelers depends on the type of particle and the acceptable risk level for the mission. Cosmic rays consist of high-energy protons, atomic nuclei, and other particles. The most energetic cosmic rays can have energies up to 10^20 electron volts (eV). However, even lower-energy cosmic rays can pose a significant risk to astronauts due to their ionizing effects on biological tissues and the potential to cause damage to DNA, leading to an increased risk of cancer and other health issues.\n\nThe amount of shielding material required to protect astronauts from the harmful effects of cosmic rays depends on several factors, including the mission duration, the spacecraft's trajectory, and the type of shielding material used. In general, the longer the mission and the closer the spacecraft is to the Earth's poles or outside the Earth's protective magnetosphere, the greater the exposure to cosmic rays and the more shielding required.\n\nShielding materials can be made from various materials, such as aluminum, polyethylene, or other materials with high hydrogen content. These materials can help to absorb and deflect cosmic rays, reducing their impact on astronauts. The thickness of the shielding material required depends on the effectiveness of the material and the desired level of protection.\n\nFor example, a study by NASA suggests that a shielding thickness of about 20 g/cm² of aluminum or 5 g/cm² of polyethylene could provide an acceptable level of protection for a 3-year Mars mission. However, these values are subject to change based on further research and advancements in shielding technology.\n\nIt is important to note that adding more shielding material also increases the mass of the spacecraft, which can affect the overall cost and feasibility of the mission. Therefore, researchers are continually working on developing more effective and lightweight shielding materials to protect astronauts from cosmic rays during long-duration space missions."
