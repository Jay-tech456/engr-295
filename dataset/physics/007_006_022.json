    "message_2": "To calculate the wavelength of a neutron in a diffraction experiment, we can use Bragg's Law, which is given by:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere:\nn = order of diffraction (we'll assume n = 1 for the first order)\nλ = wavelength of the neutron\nd = spacing of the crystal lattice (2.5 Å)\nθ = angle of scattering (30 degrees)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into Bragg's Law:\n\n1 * λ = 2 * 2.5 Å * sin(π/6)\n\nλ = 5 Å * sin(π/6)\n\nλ ≈ 5 Å * 0.5\n\nλ ≈ 2.5 Å\n\nSo, the wavelength of the neutron in this diffraction experiment is approximately 2.5 Å."
