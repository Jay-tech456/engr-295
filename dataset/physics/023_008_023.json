    "message_2": "Bell states, also known as entangled states, are essential in the process of quantum teleportation. Quantum teleportation is a method of transmitting the quantum state of an unknown particle from one location to another without physically moving the particle itself. The process relies on the principles of quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how quantum teleportation works using Bell states:\n\n1. Preparation: Two entangled qubits are created, which are in one of the four Bell states. One qubit is sent to Alice, and the other is sent to Bob. These entangled qubits will be used as a \"quantum channel\" for teleportation.\n\n2. Alice receives an unknown quantum state (qubit) that she wants to teleport to Bob. She now has two qubits: the unknown state and her half of the entangled pair.\n\n3. Alice performs a joint measurement on her two qubits (the unknown state and her half of the entangled pair) using a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate followed by a Hadamard gate. This measurement projects her qubits into one of the four Bell states.\n\n4. Alice sends the result of her measurement (classical information) to Bob through a classical communication channel. This information consists of two classical bits.\n\n5. Bob receives Alice's measurement result and applies the appropriate quantum gates (Pauli-X and/or Pauli-Z) to his half of the entangled pair based on the received classical information. This transforms his qubit into the same quantum state as the original unknown state Alice wanted to teleport.\n\n6. The quantum state of the unknown particle has now been teleported from Alice to Bob without physically moving the particle itself.\n\nLimitations of quantum teleportation:\n\n1. Quantum entanglement: Creating and maintaining entangled qubits is a challenging task, as entanglement is a delicate and easily disturbed resource.\n\n2. Classical communication: The process requires classical communication to send the measurement results, which is limited by the speed of light. This means that quantum teleportation cannot be faster than classical communication.\n\n3. No-cloning theorem: Quantum teleportation does not violate the no-cloning theorem, as it does not create an exact copy of the unknown state. Instead, it transfers the state from one qubit to another. In the process, the original state at Alice's location is destroyed.\n\n4. Quantum gate errors: The accuracy of quantum teleportation depends on the precision of the quantum gates used in the process. Any errors in the gates can lead to a less accurate transfer of the quantum state.\n\n5. Resource-intensive: Quantum teleportation requires a significant amount of resources, such as entangled qubits and quantum gates, which are currently limited in availability and scalability in quantum computing systems."
