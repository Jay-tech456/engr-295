    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the proton, we can use the formula:\n\nm_rel = m_0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m_rel is the relativistic mass, m_0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm_0 = 1.67 × 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.8c\n\nFirst, let's find the factor in the denominator:\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass:\n\nm_rel = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.36) ≈ (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / 0.6 ≈ 2.78 × 10^-27 kg\n\nThe relativistic mass of the proton when it moves at a velocity of 0.8c is approximately 2.78 × 10^-27 kg.\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy of the proton. We can use the formula:\n\nK = (m_rel - m_0)c^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy.\n\nK ≈ (2.78 × 10^-27 kg - 1.67 × 10^-27 kg) * (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ (1.11 × 10^-27 kg) * (9.00 × 10^16 m^2/s^2)\nK ≈ 9.99 × 10^-11 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the proton when it moves at a velocity of 0.8c is approximately 9.99 × 10^-11 Joules."
