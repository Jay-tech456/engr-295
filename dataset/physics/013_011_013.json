    "message_2": "The radial velocity method, also known as the Doppler spectroscopy method, is a widely used technique for detecting exoplanets and determining their masses. This method relies on the fact that a star and its orbiting exoplanet both revolve around their common center of mass, causing the star to wobble slightly. This wobble leads to a periodic shift in the star's observed spectrum due to the Doppler effect. By analyzing these shifts, we can infer the presence of an exoplanet and estimate its mass.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the radial velocity method works:\n\n1. Observations: Astronomers use high-resolution spectrographs attached to telescopes to observe the star's spectrum over a period of time. The spectrograph measures the star's radial velocity, which is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us.\n\n2. Doppler effect: When the star moves towards us, its light waves are compressed, causing the observed spectrum to shift towards the blue end (blue-shift). Conversely, when the star moves away from us, its light waves are stretched, causing the spectrum to shift towards the red end (red-shift). This change in the observed wavelength of light due to the motion of the source is known as the Doppler effect.\n\n3. Periodic shifts: If an exoplanet is orbiting the star, the star's radial velocity will exhibit periodic shifts as it wobbles around the center of mass. By analyzing these shifts, astronomers can determine the orbital period of the exoplanet.\n\n4. Kepler's Third Law: Using the orbital period and the mass of the host star, astronomers can apply Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion to calculate the semi-major axis of the exoplanet's orbit.\n\n5. Mass function: The amplitude of the radial velocity shifts depends on the mass of the exoplanet, the mass of the host star, and the inclination of the orbit with respect to our line of sight. Astronomers can use this information to derive a mass function, which relates the exoplanet's mass and orbital inclination to the observed radial velocity amplitude.\n\n6. Estimating mass: In most cases, the orbital inclination is not known, so astronomers can only determine the minimum mass of the exoplanet (denoted as M*sin(i), where M is the true mass and i is the inclination angle). However, if additional information about the inclination is available (e.g., from transit observations), the true mass of the exoplanet can be determined.\n\nIn summary, the radial velocity method allows astronomers to detect exoplanets by observing periodic shifts in the host star's spectrum due to the Doppler effect. By analyzing these shifts and applying principles from celestial mechanics, they can estimate the exoplanet's orbital period, semi-major axis, and mass."
