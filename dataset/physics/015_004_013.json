    "message_2": "To estimate the total energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = (G * M^2 * c) / R\n\nwhere E is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the collapsing star, c is the speed of light (3.0 × 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance between the supernova and Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the collapsing star to kilograms. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, so the mass of the collapsing star is:\n\nM = 1.4 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 2.7846 × 10^30 kg\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the supernova and Earth from kiloparsecs to meters. One parsec is approximately 3.086 × 10^16 meters, so 10 kiloparsecs is:\n\nR = 10 * (3.086 × 10^16 m) = 3.086 × 10^17 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (2.7846 × 10^30 kg)^2 * (3.0 × 10^8 m/s) / (3.086 × 10^17 m)\n\nE ≈ 2.0 × 10^46 J (joules)\n\nSo, the total energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion with a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the sun and a distance of 10 kiloparsecs between the supernova and Earth is approximately 2.0 × 10^46 joules."
