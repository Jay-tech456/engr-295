    "message_2": "The strength of the cosmic magnetic field in the outer reaches of our Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be around 1-5 microgauss (ÂµG). This value is derived from observations of synchrotron radiation emitted by cosmic ray electrons spiraling around the magnetic field lines, as well as from Faraday rotation measurements of polarized light from distant sources passing through the interstellar medium.\n\nWhen comparing the Milky Way's magnetic field to other galaxies of similar size and age, we find that the values are generally within the same order of magnitude. Spiral galaxies like the Milky Way typically have magnetic field strengths ranging from a few microgauss up to around 25 microgauss in their central regions. The magnetic field strength tends to decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center.\n\nIt is important to note that the magnetic field strength can vary significantly within a galaxy, depending on the local environment and the presence of structures such as spiral arms, bars, and galactic winds. Additionally, the magnetic field configuration can be quite complex, with both large-scale and small-scale structures contributing to the overall field.\n\nIn summary, the cosmic magnetic field strength in the outer reaches of the Milky Way is estimated to be around 1-5 microgauss, which is comparable to the values found in other galaxies of similar size and age."
