    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the split spectral lines in the Zeeman effect for a hydrogen atom, we need to consider the formula for the energy difference in the presence of a magnetic field:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * Δm_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and Δm_j is the change in the magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is a physical constant that represents the magnetic moment of an electron and is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * ħ / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.055 × 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.602 × 10^(-19) C) * (1.055 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the magnetic quantum number (m_j) can have values of -1, 0, and 1. The energy difference between the split spectral lines corresponds to the change in the magnetic quantum number (Δm_j) of 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy difference using the given magnetic field strength (B = 0.5 T):\n\nΔE = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * 1\nΔE ≈ 4.637 × 10^(-24) J\n\nSo, the energy difference between the split spectral lines in the Zeeman effect for a hydrogen atom with a magnetic field of 0.5 tesla is approximately 4.637 × 10^(-24) joules."
