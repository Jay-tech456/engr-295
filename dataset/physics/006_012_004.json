    "message_2": "The ionization energy required to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nIn this formula, E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (for hydrogen, Z = 1), and n is the principal quantum number (for the ground state, n = 1).\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2)\nE = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the atom, so we need to provide the energy equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the energy of the electron in the ground state:\n\nIonization energy = +13.6 eV\n\nSo, the ionization energy required to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom in its ground state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
