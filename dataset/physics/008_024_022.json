    "message_2": "The W' boson, also known as the W-prime boson, is a hypothetical elementary particle that is an extension of the electroweak theory in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is a heavier version of the W boson, which is responsible for the weak nuclear force. The predicted mass range of the W' boson is not fixed, as it depends on the specific theoretical model being considered. However, it is generally expected to be in the range of several hundred GeV (gigaelectronvolts) to a few TeV (teraelectronvolts).\n\nDetecting the W' boson would require high-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The detection process involves looking for signatures of the W' boson in the decay products of proton-proton collisions. The W' boson is expected to decay into a lepton (such as an electron or muon) and a neutrino, or into a quark and an antiquark. These decay products can be detected and measured by the collider's detectors.\n\nTo identify the presence of a W' boson, physicists would look for an excess of events with specific characteristics that match the expected decay patterns of the W' boson, compared to the background events from known processes. If a statistically significant excess is observed, it could be evidence of the existence of the W' boson. However, as of now, no experimental evidence for the W' boson has been found, and searches at the LHC continue to place constraints on its possible mass and properties."
