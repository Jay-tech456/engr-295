    "message_2": "In a universe with a cosmological constant (Λ), the maximum mass and radius of a stable black hole are determined by the properties of the so-called \"Schwarzschild-de Sitter\" black hole. This is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes a non-rotating black hole in a universe with a positive cosmological constant.\n\nThe Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole has a mass M and a Schwarzschild radius (also known as the event horizon) given by:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe cosmological constant (Λ) is related to the vacuum energy density of the universe and causes an accelerated expansion of the universe. It affects the relationship between a black hole's mass and radius by introducing an additional length scale, the de Sitter radius (RdS), which is given by:\n\nRdS = sqrt(3/Λ)\n\nFor a stable black hole in a universe with a cosmological constant, the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) must be smaller than the de Sitter radius (RdS). This condition ensures that the black hole's gravitational influence does not dominate the entire universe, and the accelerated expansion due to the cosmological constant can still occur.\n\nThe condition Rs < RdS can be written as:\n\n2GM/c^2 < sqrt(3/Λ)\n\nSolving for the maximum mass (Mmax) of a stable black hole, we get:\n\nMmax = (c^2/2G) * sqrt(3/Λ)\n\nThe corresponding maximum Schwarzschild radius (Rs,max) can be obtained by substituting Mmax back into the expression for Rs:\n\nRs,max = sqrt(3/Λ)\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass and radius of a stable black hole in a universe with a cosmological constant are determined by the de Sitter radius, which depends on the value of the cosmological constant. The larger the cosmological constant, the smaller the maximum mass and radius of a stable black hole."
