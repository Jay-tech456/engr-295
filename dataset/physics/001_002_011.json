    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of a particle, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant (ħ/2).\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position (Δx) as 0.1 nm, we can convert it to meters:\n\nΔx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nΔp ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 0.1 × 10^(-9) m)\n\nΔp ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 × 10^(-10) m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.272859 × 10^(-25) kg m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of the particle is approximately 5.27 × 10^(-25) kg m/s."
