    "message_2": "The rotational velocity profile of a typical spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, can be described as a function of the distance from the galactic center. In general, the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy is relatively flat, meaning that the rotational velocity remains roughly constant as you move outward from the center of the galaxy. This is in contrast to what would be expected if the mass distribution followed the visible matter, in which case the rotational velocity would decrease with distance from the center.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to shaping the rotational velocity profile of a spiral galaxy:\n\n1. Distribution of visible matter: The visible matter in a galaxy, such as stars, gas, and dust, contributes to the overall mass distribution and gravitational forces acting on objects within the galaxy. The distribution of this visible matter affects the rotational velocity profile.\n\n2. Dark matter: Observations of the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies have led to the hypothesis of dark matter, which is an invisible form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is believed to make up a significant portion of the mass in a galaxy, and its presence can explain the observed flat rotation curves. The distribution and amount of dark matter in a galaxy play a crucial role in shaping its rotational velocity profile.\n\n3. Supermassive black hole: Most spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their center. The gravitational influence of this black hole can affect the rotational velocity profile, especially in the central regions of the galaxy.\n\n4. Spiral arms and density waves: The spiral arms in a galaxy are regions of higher density, where stars and gas are compressed due to density waves propagating through the galactic disk. These density waves can affect the local gravitational forces and, in turn, influence the rotational velocity profile.\n\n5. Galactic bar: Some spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a central bar-like structure composed of stars and gas. The presence of a galactic bar can also influence the rotational velocity profile by altering the distribution of mass and gravitational forces within the galaxy.\n\nIn summary, the rotational velocity profile of a typical spiral galaxy is primarily shaped by the distribution of visible matter, the presence of dark matter, the influence of a supermassive black hole, and the effects of spiral arms, density waves, and galactic bars."
