    "message_2": "The Perpendicularity Theorem states that the angle between the direction of the light source and the direction of the observer's velocity vector is preserved in the rest frame of the observer. This theorem is useful in understanding the relativistic aberration of light, which describes how the apparent position of a light source changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.\n\nTo calculate the apparent position of stars seen by the observer, we can use the relativistic aberration formula. Let's denote the angle between the direction of the light source and the direction of the observer's velocity vector in the rest frame of the light source as θ, and the angle between the direction of the light source and the direction of the observer's velocity vector in the rest frame of the observer as θ'. Also, let β = v/c, where v is the relative velocity between the observer and the light source, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe relativistic aberration formula is given by:\n\ncos(θ') = (cos(θ) + β) / (1 + β * cos(θ))\n\nTo find the apparent position of stars seen by the observer, we can use this formula to calculate θ' for each star, given their respective angles θ and the observer's velocity relative to the light source.\n\nIt is important to note that this formula takes into account the relativistic effects, such as time dilation and length contraction, which become significant when the relative velocity between the observer and the light source is a significant fraction of the speed of light. In the non-relativistic limit (i.e., when v << c), the formula reduces to the classical aberration formula:\n\nθ' ≈ θ - (v/c) * sin(θ)"
