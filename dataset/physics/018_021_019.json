    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, lepton flavor violation (LFV) is not allowed in Higgs boson decays. This is because the Higgs boson couples to fermions proportional to their mass, and the mass terms in the Lagrangian conserve lepton flavor. Therefore, there are no decay modes of the Higgs boson that violate lepton flavor in the Standard Model.\n\nHowever, in some extensions of the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry or models with additional Higgs doublets, lepton flavor violation can occur. In these models, the Higgs boson can decay into different lepton flavors, such as Higgs → μτ or Higgs → eτ. The expected branching ratios for these decay modes depend on the specific model and its parameters.\n\nCurrently, experimental searches for lepton flavor violation in Higgs boson decays have not observed any significant excess over the Standard Model background. The upper limits on the branching ratios for these decay modes are:\n\n- Higgs → μτ: < 0.25% (at 95% confidence level) [CMS Collaboration, Phys. Lett. B 779 (2018) 283]\n- Higgs → eτ: < 0.61% (at 95% confidence level) [ATLAS Collaboration, JHEP 04 (2020) 159]\n\nThese limits are subject to change as more data is collected and analyzed, and they may be further constrained or potentially observed in future experiments."
