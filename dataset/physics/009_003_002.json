    "message_2": "To find the critical angle for total internal reflection, we first need to determine the refractive index of the glass. We can do this using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass, respectively), and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor air, the refractive index (n1) is approximately 1. For glass, let's assume the refractive index (n2) is 1.5 (typical for crown glass). The angle of incidence (θ1) is given as 50 degrees. We need to find the angle of refraction (θ2) to determine the refractive index of the glass.\n\n1 * sin(50°) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(50°) / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\nθ2 = arcsin(sin(50°) / 1.5) ≈ 30.97°\n\nNow that we have the angle of refraction, we can find the critical angle (θc) for total internal reflection at the glass-air interface using the formula:\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nsin(θc) = 1.5 / 1\n\nθc = arcsin(1.5) ≈ 90°\n\nHowever, since the refractive index of glass is greater than that of air, total internal reflection is not possible in this case. The light will always be refracted when passing from glass to air, and there is no critical angle for total internal reflection to occur."
