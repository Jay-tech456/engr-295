    "message_1": "What is the maximum dose of radiation that an astronaut may receive in space due to cosmic rays and how does this compare to the dose limits recommended by various international space agencies for protecting astronauts against radiation-induced health risks?",
    "message_2": "The maximum dose of radiation an astronaut may receive in space due to cosmic rays depends on various factors, such as the duration of the mission, the altitude, and the solar activity. On average, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive a dose rate of about 150-200 millisieverts (mSv) per year. This is significantly higher than the dose rate experienced on Earth, which is around 3 mSv per year.\n\nInternational space agencies have set dose limits to protect astronauts from radiation-induced health risks. For example, NASA has established a career dose limit based on age and gender, which ranges from 600 mSv for a 30-year-old female to 4000 mSv for a 60-year-old male. The European Space Agency (ESA) has a similar dose limit, with a maximum of 1000 mSv for a single mission and 3000-4000 mSv for a career, depending on age and gender.\n\nComparing these dose limits to the dose rate experienced by astronauts on the ISS, it is evident that the dose limits are set to minimize the risk of radiation-induced health issues. However, longer missions, such as a mission to Mars, would expose astronauts to higher doses of radiation, potentially exceeding the recommended limits. This is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed in future space exploration endeavors."
