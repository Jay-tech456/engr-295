    "message_1": "A wire is wrapped around an iron core to form an inductor. The inductor has a length of 20 cm and a cross-sectional area of 2 cm². The wire is tightly wrapped and carries a current of 3 A. Find the magnetic field strength at the center of the inductor.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of the inductor, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop, divided by the length (l) of the loop.\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / l\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, approximately equal to 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A.\n\nIn this problem, the current (I) is 3 A, and the length (l) of the inductor is 20 cm, which is equal to 0.2 m.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 3 A) / 0.2 m\n\nB = (12π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ (37.68 × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / 0.2 m\n\nB ≈ 1.88 × 10⁻⁵ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the inductor is approximately 1.88 × 10⁻⁵ T (Tesla)."
