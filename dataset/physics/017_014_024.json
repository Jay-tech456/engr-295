    "message_2": "To determine the critical temperature (Tc) for the phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state in a particular material, we need to use the Curie-Weiss Law. The Curie-Weiss Law is given by:\n\nχ = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ is the magnetic susceptibility, C is the Curie constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nHowever, to calculate the critical temperature (Tc) for a specific material, we need to know the material's properties, such as the Curie constant (C) and the magnetic susceptibility (χ) at a given temperature (T). If you can provide these values, I can help you calculate the critical temperature for the material."
