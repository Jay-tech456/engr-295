    "message_2": "To calculate the change in wavelength of the X-ray photon after scattering, we can use the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nGiven the initial wavelength (λ) of 0.1 nm (1 x 10^-10 m) and the scattering angle (θ) of 60 degrees, we can calculate the change in wavelength (Δλ).\n\nFirst, convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, apply the Compton scattering formula:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s) * (1 - cos(π/3))\nΔλ ≈ (2.426 x 10^-12 m) * (1 - 0.5)\nΔλ ≈ 1.213 x 10^-12 m\n\nThe change in wavelength (Δλ) is approximately 1.213 x 10^-12 m, or 1.213 pm (picometers)."
