    "message_2": "To design a quantum error correction code for a 3-qubit quantum system, we can use the well-known 3-qubit bit-flip code. This code can correct single qubit errors in the presence of random noises. The 3-qubit bit-flip code encodes a single logical qubit into three physical qubits, allowing for error detection and correction.\n\nEncoding:\n1. Prepare the logical qubit |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.\n2. Encode the logical qubit into three physical qubits using the following encoding operation:\n   |0⟩ -> |000⟩\n   |1⟩ -> |111⟩\n   So, the encoded state will be |ψ_encoded⟩ = α|000⟩ + β|111⟩.\n\nError detection and correction:\n1. Perform a parity check on the first two qubits using a CNOT gate. If a bit-flip error occurs in any of the qubits, the parity will change.\n2. Perform a parity check on the second and third qubits using another CNOT gate.\n3. Based on the parity check outcomes, we can determine which qubit (if any) experienced a bit-flip error and correct it using an X gate.\n\nNow, let's demonstrate the effectiveness of this code in correcting single qubit errors in the presence of random noises using a simulation. We will use the Qiskit library in Python for this purpose.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, execute, Aer\n\n# Define the initial logical qubit state\nalpha = 1/np.sqrt(2)\nbeta = 1/np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Create a 3-qubit quantum circuit\nqr = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')\ncr = ClassicalRegister(2, 'c')\nqc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)\n\n# Encode the logical qubit into three physical qubits\nqc.initialize([alpha, beta], 0)\nqc.cx(0, 1)\nqc.cx(0, 2)\n\n# Introduce random bit-flip errors\nnp.random.seed(42)\nerror_qubit = np.random.randint(0, 3)\nqc.x(error_qubit)\n\n# Perform parity checks\nqc.cx(0, 1)\nqc.cx(1, 2)\nqc.measure(1, 0)\nqc.measure(2, 1)\n\n# Execute the quantum circuit\nbackend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')\njob = execute(qc, backend, shots=1)\nresult = job.result()\ncounts = result.get_counts(qc)\n\n# Determine which qubit experienced a bit-flip error and correct it\nerror = int(list(counts.keys())[0], 2)\nif error != 0:\n    qc.x((error - 1) % 3)\n\n# Decode the corrected state\nqc.cx(0, 1)\nqc.cx(0, 2)\n\n# Verify the corrected state\nqc.measure_all()\njob = execute(qc, backend, shots=1)\nresult = job.result()\ncounts = result.get_counts(qc)\nprint(\"Corrected state:\", counts)\n```\n\nThis simulation demonstrates that the 3-qubit bit-flip code can effectively correct single qubit errors in the presence of random noises. The corrected state should match the initial logical qubit state, indicating successful error correction."
