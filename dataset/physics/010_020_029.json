    "message_2": "For a non-Newtonian fluid with power-law behavior, the relationship between shear stress (τ), shear rate (γ), flow index (n), and consistency index (K) can be described by the following equation:\n\nτ = K * γ^n\n\nGiven the shear stress (τ) is 10 Pa and the flow index (n) is 0.8, we can rearrange the equation to find the shear rate (γ):\n\nγ = (τ / K)^(1/n)\n\nHowever, we do not have the consistency index (K) provided. To find the viscosity (μ) of the fluid, we need the consistency index (K). The relationship between viscosity, shear rate, and consistency index can be described by the following equation:\n\nμ = K * γ^(n-1)\n\nWithout the consistency index (K), we cannot determine the shear rate (γ) and viscosity (μ) of the fluid. If you can provide the consistency index, we can solve the problem."
