    "message_2": "To calculate the refractive index of a semiconductor material, we can use the following formula:\n\nn(λ) = √(ε(λ) - (Eg^2 * λ^2) / (4 * π^2 * c^2))\n\nwhere n(λ) is the refractive index at wavelength λ, ε(λ) is the dielectric constant at wavelength λ, Eg is the bandgap energy, λ is the wavelength, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nGiven the bandgap energy Eg = 2.5 eV, the dielectric constant ε = 12.5, and the wavelength λ = 550 nm, we can calculate the refractive index.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bandgap energy from eV to Joules:\n\nEg (Joules) = Eg (eV) * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV\nEg (Joules) = 2.5 eV * 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV\nEg (Joules) = 4.00545 × 10^(-19) J\n\nNext, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters:\n\nλ (meters) = λ (nm) * 10^(-9) m/nm\nλ (meters) = 550 nm * 10^(-9) m/nm\nλ (meters) = 5.5 × 10^(-7) m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nn(λ) = √(12.5 - (4.00545 × 10^(-19) J * (5.5 × 10^(-7) m)^2) / (4 * π^2 * (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2))\nn(λ) = √(12.5 - (4.00545 × 10^(-19) J * 3.025 × 10^(-13) m^2) / (4 * π^2 * 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2))\nn(λ) = √(12.5 - (1.212 × 10^(-31) J * m^2) / (3.54 × 10^(-17) m^2/s^2))\nn(λ) = √(12.5 - 34.2)\nn(λ) = √(-21.7)\n\nSince the result is a complex number, it indicates that the refractive index is complex, which means that the material has both a real part (refractive index) and an imaginary part (absorption coefficient). However, the given information is not sufficient to calculate the real and imaginary parts separately. More information about the material's absorption properties would be needed to determine the complex refractive index."
