    "message_2": "The predicted mass range for sterile neutrinos that could account for the observed dark matter abundance in the universe is not well-defined, as there are various models and scenarios that predict different mass ranges. However, based on current experimental and observational constraints, the mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is typically in the keV (kilo-electronvolt) scale, with values ranging from a few keV to tens of keV.\n\nThis mass range is significantly larger than the known mass range of active neutrinos. The active neutrinos, which are the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos, have much smaller masses. The exact masses of active neutrinos are not yet known, but the differences in their squared masses have been measured. The mass differences indicate that the heaviest active neutrino has a mass less than 0.23 eV (electronvolt), which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the mass range of sterile neutrinos considered for dark matter.\n\nIt is important to note that the sterile neutrino mass range and its role in dark matter are still subjects of ongoing research, and future experimental results may refine or change our understanding of these particles."
