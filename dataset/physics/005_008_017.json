The crew of the spaceship observes a stationary planet whose length in the direction of motion appears to be 40% shorter than its measured length on Earth. Determine the Lorentz factor, the time dilation factor, and the corresponding time elapsed on the planet according to the spaceship crew and on Earth according to an observer on Earth over a period of 10 years on Earth.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Lorentz factor (γ), we can use the following formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.8c) and c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / √(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nThe Lorentz factor is approximately 1.67.\n\nThe time dilation factor is the same as the Lorentz factor, so the time dilation factor is also approximately 1.67.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding time elapsed on the planet according to the spaceship crew and on Earth according to an observer on Earth over a period of 10 years on Earth.\n\nTime elapsed on Earth (t_Earth) = 10 years\n\nTime elapsed on the spaceship (t_spaceship) = t_Earth / γ\nt_spaceship = 10 years / 1.67\nt_spaceship ≈ 6 years\n\nSo, over a period of 10 years on Earth, the spaceship crew would observe approximately 6 years elapsed on the planet."
