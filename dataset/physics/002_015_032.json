    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between the high-temperature reservoir at 80°C and the low-temperature reservoir at 20°C. If the heat pump consumes 600 J of work and extracts 1500 J of heat from the low-temperature reservoir, what is its coefficient of performance (COP)?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat delivered to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H) to the work input (W):\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\n\nFirst, we need to find the heat delivered to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H). We can do this using the energy conservation principle, which states that the total energy input (work input + heat extracted from the low-temperature reservoir) is equal to the total energy output (heat delivered to the high-temperature reservoir):\n\nW + Q_L = Q_H\n\nwhere W is the work input (600 J), Q_L is the heat extracted from the low-temperature reservoir (1500 J), and Q_H is the heat delivered to the high-temperature reservoir.\n\nNow we can solve for Q_H:\n\nQ_H = W + Q_L\nQ_H = 600 J + 1500 J\nQ_H = 2100 J\n\nNow that we have the heat delivered to the high-temperature reservoir (Q_H), we can calculate the COP:\n\nCOP = Q_H / W\nCOP = 2100 J / 600 J\nCOP = 3.5\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is 3.5."
