    "message_2": "To find the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the refractive index and angle of refraction in the second medium (the material).\n\nGiven n1 = 1, θ1 = 30 degrees, and n2 = 1.5, we can solve for θ2:\n\n1 * sin(30) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.5 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.3333 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.3333)\n\nθ2 ≈ 19.47 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction of the light ray is approximately 19.47 degrees."
