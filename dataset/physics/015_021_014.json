    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a black hole with an accretion disk, we need to consider the specific dynamics of the system. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given information into SI units:\n\n1 solar mass (M☉) ≈ 1.989 x 10^30 kg\n1 light year (ly) ≈ 9.461 x 10^15 m\n\nMass of the black hole (M) = 10 M☉ = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nDistance from the black hole (R) = 1 ly = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n\nNow, let's assume that the accretion disk is in a quasi-steady state, meaning that the mass accretion rate is roughly constant. In this case, the gravitational wave frequency (f) can be estimated using the orbital frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, which is given by:\n\nf_ISCO ≈ c^3 / (6^(3/2) * π * G * M)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s) and G is the gravitational constant (≈ 6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3/kg/s^2).\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) can be estimated using the quadrupole formula:\n\nh ≈ (32/5) * (G^2/c^4) * (M^2/R)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual values may vary depending on the specific dynamics of the black hole and its accretion disk. Additionally, these formulas assume that the black hole is non-rotating (Schwarzschild black hole). If the black hole is rotating (Kerr black hole), the frequency and amplitude calculations would be different."
