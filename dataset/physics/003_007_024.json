    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from a 20 cm long rod carrying a current of 6 A, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the small current element, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest.\n\nSince the rod is perpendicular to the plane of the page and the point of interest is on the same plane as the rod, we can simplify the problem by considering the magnetic field due to each small current element along the rod and integrating over the length of the rod.\n\nLet's consider a small current element dl at a distance x from the bottom of the rod. The distance from this current element to the point of interest is:\n\nr = sqrt(x^2 + (5 cm)^2)\n\nThe angle between the current element and the position vector is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can write the magnetic field dB due to this small current element as:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r^3\n\nIntegrating over the length of the rod (from 0 to 20 cm), we get the total magnetic field B:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * I * ∫(dl * r) / r^3 dx from 0 to 20 cm\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π * 10^-7 N/A² / 4π) * 6 A * ∫(dl * sqrt(x^2 + 5^2)) / (x^2 + 5^2)^(3/2) dx from 0 to 20 cm\n\nB = (10^-7 N/A²) * 6 A * ∫(dl * sqrt(x^2 + 5^2)) / (x^2 + 5^2)^(3/2) dx from 0 to 20 cm\n\nNow, we can perform the integration:\n\nB = (6 * 10^-7 N/A²) * [arcsinh(x/5)] from 0 to 20 cm\n\nB = (6 * 10^-7 N/A²) * [arcsinh(20/5) - arcsinh(0/5)]\n\nB = (6 * 10^-7 N/A²) * arcsinh(4)\n\nB ≈ 1.22 * 10^-6 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the 20 cm long rod carrying a current of 6 A is approximately 1.22 * 10^-6 T."
