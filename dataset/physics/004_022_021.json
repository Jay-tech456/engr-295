    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency and wavelength of gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two neutron stars with a combined mass of 3 solar masses, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. The frequency of the gravitational waves (f) can be estimated using the formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), and M is the total mass of the system in kilograms.\n\n2. The wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves can be calculated using the formula:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nFirst, we need to convert the combined mass of the neutron stars from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the combined mass of the neutron stars is:\n\n3 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 5.967 x 10^30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (f) of the gravitational waves:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 5.967 x 10^30 kg * π) ≈ 1570 Hz\n\nFinally, we can calculate the wavelength (λ) of the gravitational waves:\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / 1570 Hz ≈ 1.91 x 10^5 m\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two neutron stars with a combined mass of 3 solar masses is approximately 1570 Hz, and the expected wavelength is approximately 1.91 x 10^5 meters."
