    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the circular disc, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying disc:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (z² + R²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the disc, and z is the distance from the center of the disc along its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 5 A\nR = 0.1 m\nz = 0.05 m\n\nFirst, let's calculate (z² + R²)^(3/2):\n\n(z² + R²)^(3/2) = (0.05² + 0.1²)^(3/2) = (0.0125 + 0.01)^(3/2) = 0.0225^(3/2) = 0.003375\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.1² m²) / (2 * 0.003375 m³)\nB = (6.2832 × 10^(-7) T * 5 * 0.01) / 0.00675\nB = 3.1416 × 10^(-8) T / 0.00675\nB ≈ 4.65 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at the point located on the disc's axis, a distance of 0.05 m from its center, is approximately 4.65 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current (which is counterclockwise when viewed from above), your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field is pointing upward along the axis of the disc."
