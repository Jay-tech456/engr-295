    "message_2": "Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single point, causing a blurred and fuzzy image. It is more pronounced in lenses with a large aperture and a short focal length. In this case, the focal length of the concave lens is 20 cm.\n\nTo calculate the spherical aberration, we need to know the aperture size (diameter) of the lens. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact spherical aberration value.\n\nHowever, we can still suggest a few solutions to reduce the spherical aberration in the lens:\n\n1. Reduce the aperture size: By reducing the aperture size, the light rays passing through the outer regions of the lens are minimized, which can help reduce the spherical aberration.\n\n2. Use an aspheric lens: Aspheric lenses are designed with a non-spherical surface, which can help correct for spherical aberration. Replacing the current concave lens with an aspheric lens can improve the image quality.\n\n3. Use a lens combination: Combining multiple lenses with different curvatures can help to compensate for the spherical aberration in each lens, resulting in a better overall image quality.\n\n4. Apply a corrective coating: Some lenses can be coated with a material that can help correct for spherical aberration by altering the refractive index of the lens surface.\n\n5. Use a diaphragm or stop: Placing a diaphragm or stop in front of the lens can help block the light rays that cause spherical aberration, resulting in a sharper image.\n\nIt's important to note that the best solution will depend on the specific requirements of the optical system and the desired image quality."
