    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Several observations and experimental evidence suggest the existence of dark matter:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies, particularly spiral galaxies, show that the mass distribution in these systems is not consistent with the distribution of visible matter alone. The observed rotation curves remain flat or even increase at large distances from the galactic center, indicating the presence of an additional, unseen mass component, which is attributed to dark matter.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies and quasars as it passes through the gravitational field of massive foreground objects, such as galaxy clusters, provides another evidence for dark matter. The amount of lensing observed is often much greater than what can be accounted for by the visible mass in these systems, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB): The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang. Detailed measurements of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB provide information about the density and composition of the early universe. These measurements indicate that a significant fraction of the total mass-energy content of the universe is in the form of non-baryonic dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the presence of dark matter. Dark matter is thought to provide the gravitational scaffolding upon which visible matter collapses and forms galaxies and galaxy clusters. Simulations of structure formation that include dark matter produce results that closely match the observed large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n5. Bullet Cluster: The Bullet Cluster is a system of two colliding galaxy clusters. Observations of this system provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. The hot gas in the clusters, which emits X-rays, is slowed down by the collision, while the dark matter, inferred from gravitational lensing, appears to pass through the collision unaffected. This separation of visible and dark matter supports the idea that dark matter is a distinct component of the universe.\n\nThe current understanding of the role of dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution is that it plays a crucial role in providing the gravitational potential wells that allow baryonic matter (i.e., normal matter composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons) to collapse and form galaxies. Dark matter is thought to form a halo around galaxies, with the visible matter concentrated in the central regions. The presence of dark matter also influences the dynamics of galaxy interactions and mergers, as well as the growth of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. However, the exact nature and properties of dark matter remain unknown, and its identification and characterization are among the most important open questions in modern physics and cosmology."
