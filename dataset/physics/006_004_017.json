    "message_2": "The effect of an external electric field on the spectral lines of a hydrogen atom is known as the Stark effect. The Stark effect causes a splitting and shifting of the spectral lines due to the interaction between the electric field and the electric dipole moment of the atom. This effect is more significant for higher energy levels of the atom, as the electron is further from the nucleus and more susceptible to the influence of the external electric field.\n\nThe energy shift of the spectral lines can be calculated using the formula for the Stark effect, which is given by:\n\nΔE = ±(3/4) * e * F * a₀ * n²\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^(-19) C), F is the electric field strength, a₀ is the Bohr radius (5.29 x 10^(-11) m), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nTo plot the resulting graphs for different electric field strengths, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Choose a range of electric field strengths (F) to analyze, for example, from 0 to 10^8 V/m.\n2. For each electric field strength, calculate the energy shift (ΔE) for different energy levels (n) using the Stark effect formula.\n3. Plot the energy shift (ΔE) as a function of the electric field strength (F) for each energy level (n).\n\nThe resulting graphs will show the energy shift of the spectral lines as a function of the electric field strength for different energy levels of the hydrogen atom. The graphs will reveal that the energy shift increases with increasing electric field strength and is more significant for higher energy levels."
