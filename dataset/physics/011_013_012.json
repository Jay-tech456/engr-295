    "message_1": "Consider a copper wire of length 1 meter and diameter 1 millimeter. The wire has a resistivity of 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm at 20°C. Calculate the electrical conductivity of copper at 20°C and the resistance of the wire. If a potential difference of 10 V is applied across the wire, what will be the current passing through the wire?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the electrical conductivity of copper at 20°C. Electrical conductivity (σ) is the reciprocal of resistivity (ρ), so:\n\nσ = 1/ρ\nσ = 1/(1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm)\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10⁷ S/m\n\nNow, let's calculate the resistance of the wire. We can use the formula:\n\nR = ρ * (L/A)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. The area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = π * (d/2)²\n\nwhere d is the diameter of the wire. In this case, d = 1 mm = 0.001 m. So,\n\nA = π * (0.001/2)²\nA ≈ 7.854 × 10⁻⁷ m²\n\nNow we can calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ωm) * (1 m / 7.854 × 10⁻⁷ m²)\nR ≈ 0.214 Ω\n\nFinally, let's find the current passing through the wire when a potential difference of 10 V is applied. We can use Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V/R\n\nwhere I is the current and V is the potential difference. In this case, V = 10 V. So,\n\nI = 10 V / 0.214 Ω\nI ≈ 46.7 A\n\nTherefore, the electrical conductivity of copper at 20°C is approximately 5.95 × 10⁷ S/m, the resistance of the wire is approximately 0.214 Ω, and the current passing through the wire when a potential difference of 10 V is applied is approximately 46.7 A."
