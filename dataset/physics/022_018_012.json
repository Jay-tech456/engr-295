    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum mass required for a MACHO to produce detectable gravitational microlensing effects, we can use the Einstein radius formula. The Einstein radius (θ_E) is the angular separation between the source star and its lensed image, which is given by:\n\nθ_E = √(4G * M / c^2 * D)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the MACHO, c is the speed of light, and D is the effective lensing distance, which can be expressed as:\n\nD = (D_L * D_S) / (D_L + D_S)\n\nHere, D_L is the distance from the observer (Earth) to the lens (MACHO), and D_S is the distance from the observer to the source star. In this problem, we are given that the source star is at a distance of 10 kpc (kilo-parsecs) from Earth. We can assume that the MACHO is located halfway between the Earth and the source star, so D_L = D_S = 5 kpc.\n\nNow, we can calculate the effective lensing distance D:\n\nD = (5 kpc * 5 kpc) / (5 kpc + 5 kpc)\nD = 25 kpc^2 / 10 kpc\nD = 2.5 kpc\n\nTo produce a detectable microlensing effect, the Einstein radius should be larger than the angular resolution of a telescope. The angular resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope is about 0.05 arcseconds. We can convert this to radians:\n\nθ_E = 0.05 arcseconds * (π / 648000) radians/arcsecond ≈ 2.42 x 10^-7 radians\n\nNow, we can solve for the mass M of the MACHO using the Einstein radius formula:\n\nθ_E = √(4G * M / c^2 * D)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nθ_E^2 = 4G * M / c^2 * D\n\nRearranging for M:\n\nM = (θ_E^2 * c^2 * D) / 4G\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM = ((2.42 x 10^-7 radians)^2 * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * (2.5 kpc * 3.086 x 10^19 m/kpc)) / (4 * 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2)\n\nM ≈ 1.67 x 10^28 kg\n\nSo, the minimum mass required for a MACHO to produce detectable gravitational microlensing effects on a distant star with a mass of 1 solar mass located at a distance of 10 kpc from Earth is approximately 1.67 x 10^28 kg."
