Calculate these quantities both in the rest frame of the particle and in a frame in which the particle is moving with a velocity of 0.99c along the x-axis.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy and momentum of a particle with rest mass m moving with a velocity of 0.99c, we will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (mc²)² + (pc)²\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ) for the velocity 0.99c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99c/c)²)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9801)\nγ ≈ 7.0888\n\nNow, let's calculate the momentum (p) and energy (E) in the frame where the particle is moving with a velocity of 0.99c along the x-axis.\n\nMomentum (p):\np = γmv\np = 7.0888 * m * 0.99c\np ≈ 7.0180 * mc\n\nEnergy (E):\nE = γmc²\nE = 7.0888 * mc²\nE ≈ 7.0888mc²\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy and momentum in the rest frame of the particle. In the rest frame, the particle is not moving, so its velocity (v) is 0.\n\nMomentum (p_rest):\np_rest = 0 (since the particle is at rest)\n\nEnergy (E_rest):\nE_rest = mc² (since the particle is at rest)\n\nSo, in the rest frame of the particle, the momentum is 0, and the energy is mc². In the frame where the particle is moving with a velocity of 0.99c along the x-axis, the momentum is approximately 7.0180 * mc, and the energy is approximately 7.0888 * mc²."
