    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at 70% of the speed of light towards a planet. A beam of light from the planet is emitted at an angle of 30 degrees relative to the direction of motion of the spaceship. What is the angle at which the light appears to approach the spaceship? (Hint: Use the equation for relativistic aberration of light)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the equation for relativistic aberration of light:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) / (γ * (cos(θ) + β)))\n\nwhere:\nθ is the angle at which the light is emitted (30 degrees)\nθ' is the angle at which the light appears to approach the spaceship\nβ is the spaceship's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (0.7)\nγ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.7^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.49)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.51)\nγ ≈ 1.401\n\nNow, we can use the equation for relativistic aberration of light to find the angle θ':\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(θ) / (γ * (cos(θ) + β)))\ntan(θ') = (sin(30°) / (1.401 * (cos(30°) + 0.7)))\n\nConvert the angle to radians:\n\n30° * (π / 180) ≈ 0.524 radians\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\ntan(θ') = (sin(0.524) / (1.401 * (cos(0.524) + 0.7)))\ntan(θ') ≈ (0.5 / (1.401 * (0.866 + 0.7)))\ntan(θ') ≈ (0.5 / (1.401 * 1.566))\ntan(θ') ≈ (0.5 / 2.194)\ntan(θ') ≈ 0.228\n\nNow, find the angle θ':\n\nθ' = arctan(0.228)\nθ' ≈ 0.229 radians\n\nConvert the angle back to degrees:\n\nθ' ≈ 0.229 * (180 / π)\nθ' ≈ 13.1°\n\nSo, the angle at which the light appears to approach the spaceship is approximately 13.1 degrees."
