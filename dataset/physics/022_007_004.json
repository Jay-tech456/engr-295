    "message_2": "To calculate the expected rate of dark matter particle interactions per unit detector mass per unit time, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Dark matter mass (m_DM): 100 GeV/c²\n2. Cross section (σ): 10⁻⁴ pb (picobarns)\n3. Local dark matter density (ρ_DM): ~0.3 GeV/cm³ (typical value in our galaxy)\n4. Dark matter velocity (v_DM): ~220 km/s (typical value in our galaxy)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the units:\n\n1 GeV/c² = 1.783 × 10⁻²⁴ g\n1 pb = 10⁻⁴⁰ cm²\n\nNow, we can calculate the number density (n_DM) of dark matter particles:\n\nn_DM = ρ_DM / m_DM = (0.3 GeV/cm³) / (100 GeV/c²)\nn_DM ≈ 0.003 cm⁻³\n\nNext, we need to convert the dark matter velocity to cm/s:\n\nv_DM = 220 km/s × (10⁵ cm/km) = 2.2 × 10⁷ cm/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction rate (R) per unit detector mass per unit time:\n\nR = n_DM × σ × v_DM = (0.003 cm⁻³) × (10⁻⁴⁰ cm²) × (2.2 × 10⁷ cm/s)\nR ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻³⁴ s⁻¹\n\nFinally, we need to consider the detector mass (1 kg) to find the total interaction rate:\n\n1 kg = 1000 g = 1000/1.783 × 10⁻²⁴ = 5.61 × 10²³ dark matter particles\n\nTotal interaction rate (R_total) = R × detector mass in dark matter particles\nR_total ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻³⁴ s⁻¹ × 5.61 × 10²³\nR_total ≈ 3.7 × 10⁻¹⁰ s⁻¹\n\nSo, the expected rate of dark matter particle interactions for a 1 kg detector is approximately 3.7 × 10⁻¹⁰ interactions per second."
