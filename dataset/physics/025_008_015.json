    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the force generated by a muscle during contraction based on the muscle's cross-sectional area and the tension it produces. Assuming a muscle has a cross-sectional area of 50 cmÂ² and produces a tension of 500 N, what is the force generated by the muscle during contraction?",
    "message_2": "The force generated by the muscle during contraction is equal to the tension it produces. In this case, the tension produced by the muscle is given as 500 N. Therefore, the force generated by the muscle during contraction is also 500 N."
