    "message_2": "To calculate the magnification and determine whether the image is real or virtual, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven, f = 20 cm and u = 30 cm. We can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo find v, we can solve for it:\n\n1/v = 1/20 - 1/30\n1/v = (30 - 20) / (20 * 30)\n1/v = 10 / 600\nv = 600 / 10\nv = 60 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance (v), we can calculate the magnification using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -60/30\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object. Since the magnification is negative and the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted."
