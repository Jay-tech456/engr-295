    "message_1": "A particle with rest mass $m_0$ decays into two particles, one with rest mass $m_1$ which is at rest after the decay, and another particle with rest mass $m_2$ which is emitted with velocity $v$ in the laboratory frame. What is the speed of the first particle in the laboratory frame in terms of $m_0$, $m_1$, $m_2$, and $v$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to conserve both energy and momentum during the decay process. Let's first consider the conservation of energy. Before the decay, the total energy is the rest energy of the initial particle:\n\n$E_0 = m_0 c^2$\n\nAfter the decay, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two decay products:\n\n$E_1 = m_1 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2$\n\n$E_2 = m_2 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v^2$\n\nThe conservation of energy implies:\n\n$E_0 = E_1 + E_2$\n\nNow, let's consider the conservation of momentum. Before the decay, the initial particle is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the two decay products are:\n\n$p_1 = m_1 v_1$\n\n$p_2 = m_2 v$\n\nThe conservation of momentum implies:\n\n$p_1 + p_2 = 0$\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns ($v_1$ and $E_1$). We can solve for $v_1$ using the conservation of momentum equation:\n\n$v_1 = -\\frac{m_2}{m_1} v$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $v_1$ into the conservation of energy equation:\n\n$m_0 c^2 = m_1 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_1 (-\\frac{m_2}{m_1} v)^2 + m_2 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$m_0 c^2 = m_1 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v^2 + m_2 c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v^2$\n\n$0 = (m_1 + m_2) c^2 - m_0 c^2 + m_2 v^2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $v_1$:\n\n$v_1 = -\\frac{m_2}{m_1} v = -\\frac{m_2}{m_1} \\sqrt{\\frac{(m_1 + m_2) c^2 - m_0 c^2}{m_2}}$\n\nSo, the speed of the first particle in the laboratory frame is:\n\n$v_1 = -\\frac{m_2}{m_1} \\sqrt{\\frac{(m_1 + m_2) c^2 - m_0 c^2}{m_2}}$"
