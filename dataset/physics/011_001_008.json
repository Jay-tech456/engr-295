    "message_2": "To determine the crystal structure of the material, we can use the Bragg's Law and the Miller indices (h, k, l) for different crystal structures. Bragg's Law is given by:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of incidence.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio of the d-spacings for the three peaks:\n\nd1/d2 = 0.216/0.196 ≈ 1.102\nd1/d3 = 0.216/0.174 ≈ 1.241\nd2/d3 = 0.196/0.174 ≈ 1.126\n\nNow, let's consider the possible crystal structures and their corresponding (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) values:\n\n1. Simple cubic (SC): (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\n2. Body-centered cubic (BCC): (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = 2, 4, 6, 8, ...\n3. Face-centered cubic (FCC): (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = 3, 4, 8, 11, ...\n\nWe can calculate the ratios of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) for the three peaks:\n\n(h1^2 + k1^2 + l1^2)/(h2^2 + k2^2 + l2^2) = (d2/d1)^2 = (0.196/0.216)^2 ≈ 0.817\n(h1^2 + k1^2 + l1^2)/(h3^2 + k3^2 + l3^2) = (d3/d1)^2 = (0.174/0.216)^2 ≈ 0.651\n(h2^2 + k2^2 + l2^2)/(h3^2 + k3^2 + l3^2) = (d3/d2)^2 = (0.174/0.196)^2 ≈ 0.790\n\nComparing the calculated ratios with the possible crystal structures, we can see that the ratios are close to the values for the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure:\n\n1.102 ≈ 4/3\n1.241 ≈ 8/3\n1.126 ≈ 8/4\n\nTherefore, the crystal structure of the material is most likely face-centered cubic (FCC)."
