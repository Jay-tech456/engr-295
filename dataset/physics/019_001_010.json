    "message_2": "In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the scattering amplitude for the interaction between two electrons via the exchange of a photon can be calculated using Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory up to first order. The relevant Feynman diagram for this process is called the \"t-channel\" or \"s-channel\" diagram, depending on the orientation of the photon exchange.\n\nThe scattering amplitude for this process, often denoted as M, can be written as:\n\nM = -e^2 u_2(p_2') γ^μ u_1(p_1') (-g_μν / q^2) u_1(p_1) γ^ν u_2(p_2)\n\nHere, e is the elementary charge, u_i(p_i) and u_i(p_i') are the initial and final state electron wave functions (spinors) for electrons 1 and 2, γ^μ and γ^ν are the gamma matrices, g_μν is the metric tensor, and q^2 is the momentum transfer squared (q = p_1 - p_1' = p_2' - p_2).\n\nThe expression above represents the amplitude for the process e^-(p_1) + e^-(p_2) → e^-(p_1') + e^-(p_2'), where p_i and p_i' are the initial and final momenta of the electrons.\n\nTo obtain the differential cross-section, one must square the amplitude, sum over final spins, average over initial spins, and integrate over the phase space of the final state particles. This calculation involves some algebra and simplifications using the properties of gamma matrices and spinors. The final result for the differential cross-section in the center-of-mass frame is given by:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (α^2 / 4s) (1 + cos^2(θ))\n\nHere, α = e^2 / (4π) is the fine-structure constant, s is the Mandelstam variable (s = (p_1 + p_2)^2), and θ is the scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nThis result is known as the Møller scattering formula, which describes the scattering of two electrons via the exchange of a photon in QED up to first order."
