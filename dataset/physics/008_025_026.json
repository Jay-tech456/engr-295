    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Its decay modes depend on its mass, which is approximately 125 GeV/c².\n\nThe different decay modes of the Higgs boson, along with their approximate branching ratios, are as follows:\n\n1. Higgs boson decay into a pair of bottom quarks (b and b-bar) - ~58%\n2. Higgs boson decay into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-) - ~21%\n3. Higgs boson decay into a pair of tau leptons (τ+ and τ-) - ~6.3%\n4. Higgs boson decay into a pair of charm quarks (c and c-bar) - ~2.9%\n5. Higgs boson decay into a pair of Z bosons (Z and Z) - ~2.6%\n6. Higgs boson decay into a pair of gluons (g and g) - ~8.6% (This occurs indirectly through a loop of virtual top quarks)\n7. Higgs boson decay into a pair of photons (γ and γ) - ~0.2% (This occurs indirectly through a loop of virtual charged particles, primarily top quarks and W bosons)\n\nIn each decay mode, the properties of the Higgs boson change as it transforms into different particles. The Higgs boson itself has zero electric charge, zero spin, and a mass of about 125 GeV/c². When it decays, its properties are conserved through the properties of the resulting particles. For example, when the Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons, the electric charges of the W+ and W- bosons sum to zero, conserving the electric charge. Similarly, the total energy and momentum of the decay products are conserved.\n\nThe decay modes of the Higgs boson are crucial for its experimental detection, as the Higgs boson itself cannot be directly observed. Instead, physicists look for the characteristic signatures of its decay products in particle detectors. The discovery of the Higgs boson was confirmed through the observation of its decay into pairs of photons and Z bosons, as these decay modes have relatively clean experimental signatures."
