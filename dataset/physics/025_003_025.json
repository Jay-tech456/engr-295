    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical potential difference across the membrane, we can use the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation. The GHK equation is as follows:\n\nVm = (RT/zF) * ln((P_K[K_out] + P_Na[Na_out]) / (P_K[K_in] + P_Na[Na_in]))\n\nWhere:\n- Vm is the membrane potential\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin (assume 298K for room temperature)\n- z is the valence of the ion (+1 for both K+ and Na+)\n- F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol)\n- P_K and P_Na are the permeabilities of the potassium and sodium ions, respectively\n- [K_out], [K_in], [Na_out], and [Na_in] are the concentrations of the ions outside and inside the cell, respectively\n\nAssuming equal permeabilities for potassium and sodium ions (P_K = P_Na = 1), we can plug in the given concentrations:\n\nVm = (8.314 * 298) / (1 * 96485) * ln((1 * 100 + 1 * 10) / (1 * 10 + 1 * 10))\n\nVm = (2475.932) / (96485) * ln(110 / 20)\n\nVm = 0.0257 * ln(5.5)\n\nVm ≈ 0.0257 * 1.7047\n\nVm ≈ 0.0438 V or 43.8 mV\n\nSo, the electrical potential difference across the membrane is approximately 43.8 mV."
