    "message_2": "The relationship between the crystal structure of ferroelectric materials and their ferroelectric properties lies in the presence of a spontaneous electric polarization in the material. Ferroelectric materials have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which means that their crystal lattice lacks a center of symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric structure allows for the presence of a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an external electric field. The ferroelectric properties of these materials are mainly due to the presence of polar domains, which are regions with a uniform direction of polarization.\n\nPiezoelectric materials, on the other hand, also exhibit a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, but they do not possess a spontaneous electric polarization. Instead, piezoelectric materials generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress or strain, and vice versa. This property is due to the asymmetric distribution of positive and negative charges within the crystal lattice, which results in the generation of an electric dipole moment when the material is deformed.\n\nThe main difference between ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials lies in the presence of a spontaneous electric polarization in ferroelectric materials, which can be reversed by an external electric field. In contrast, piezoelectric materials do not have a spontaneous polarization but generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress or strain. Both types of materials have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures, which are essential for their respective properties."
