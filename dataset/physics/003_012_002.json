    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point above the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields to get the total magnetic field at the point above the center.\n\nLet's consider a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the loop and the point of interest (0.1 m above the center) along the z-axis. We can calculate the magnetic field due to each segment using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * a) / (4π * (a² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere a is half the length of the segment and z is the distance above the center.\n\nFor the two segments with length 0.3 m:\na1 = 0.3 / 2 = 0.15 m\nB1 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.15 m) / (4π * (0.15² + 0.1²)^(3/2))\nB1 = 1.5 × 10^(-6) T / (0.15² + 0.1²)^(3/2)\nB1 = 1.5 × 10^(-6) T / (0.0325)^(3/2)\nB1 ≈ 1.96 × 10^(-5) T\n\nFor the two segments with length 0.4 m:\na2 = 0.4 / 2 = 0.2 m\nB2 = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 0.2 m) / (4π * (0.2² + 0.1²)^(3/2))\nB2 = 2 × 10^(-6) T / (0.2² + 0.1²)^(3/2)\nB2 = 2 × 10^(-6) T / (0.05)^(3/2)\nB2 ≈ 1.79 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSince the magnetic field is a vector, we need to sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment. The magnetic fields due to the segments with length 0.3 m are in the same direction, so we can add them directly:\n\nB_vertical = 2 * B1 = 2 * 1.96 × 10^(-5) T ≈ 3.92 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic fields due to the segments with length 0.4 m are also in the same direction, so we can add them directly:\n\nB_horizontal = 2 * B2 = 2 * 1.79 × 10^(-5) T ≈ 3.58 × 10^(-5) T\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field by adding the vertical and horizontal components:\n\nB_total = B_vertical + B_horizontal = 3.92 × 10^(-5) T + 3.58 × 10^(-5) T ≈ 7.50 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 0.1 m above the center of the loop is approximately 7.50 × 10^(-5) T."
