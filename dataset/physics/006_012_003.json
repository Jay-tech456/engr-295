    "message_2": "The ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of hydrogen:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the electron, Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), and n is the principal quantum number (n = 1 for the ground state).\n\nFor a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1), the formula becomes:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nThe ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, which is the opposite of the energy of the electron in the ground state. Therefore, the ionization energy is:\n\nIonization energy = -E = 13.6 eV"
