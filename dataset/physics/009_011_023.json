    "message_1": "A diverging lens has a focal length of -20 cm. If the radius of curvature of one of its surfaces is 40 cm and its refractive index is 1.5, what is the radius of curvature of the other surface?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lensmaker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens.\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = -20 cm), the refractive index (n = 1.5), and the radius of curvature of one surface (R1 = 40 cm). We need to find the radius of curvature of the other surface (R2).\n\nPlugging the given values into the lensmaker's formula:\n\n1/(-20) = (1.5 - 1) * (1/40 - 1/R2).\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n-1/20 = 0.5 * (1/40 - 1/R2).\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\n-1/10 = 1/40 - 1/R2.\n\nNext, we'll isolate the term with R2:\n\n1/R2 = 1/40 + 1/10.\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 40:\n\n1/R2 = 1/40 + 4/40.\n\nNow, add the fractions:\n\n1/R2 = 5/40.\n\nTo find R2, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nR2 = 40/5.\n\nFinally, simplify the fraction:\n\nR2 = 8 cm.\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of the other surface is 8 cm."
