    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop of wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying a current (I) at a point located at a distance (r) from the segment is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), θ is the angle between the current direction and the line connecting the wire segment to the point, and r is the distance from the wire segment to the point.\n\nSince the square loop has four equal sides, we can find the magnetic field produced by one side and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. The length of the side is 10 cm or 0.1 m. The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one side is half the diagonal, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\ndiagonal = √(0.1² + 0.1²) = √(0.02) = 0.1414 m\nhalf_diagonal = 0.1414 / 2 = 0.0707 m\n\nNow, let's divide the side into small segments (dl) and integrate the Biot-Savart Law over the entire side. Since the magnetic field is symmetrical, the angle θ is the same for all segments, and it is 45° or π/4 radians. Therefore, sinθ = sin(π/4) = 1/√2.\n\nIntegrating the Biot-Savart Law over one side:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²) * sinθ\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * sinθ) / (4 * π) * ∫(dl / r²)\n\nSince r is constant (0.0707 m) for all segments on one side:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²) * L\n\nwhere L is the length of the side (0.1 m).\n\nNow, we can find the total magnetic field at the center by multiplying B_side by 4:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ * I * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²) * L\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB_total = 4 * (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 1/√2) / (4 * π * (0.0707 m)²) * 0.1 m\n\nB_total ≈ 1.26 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the 10 cm by 10 cm square loop of wire carrying a current of 2 A is approximately 1.26 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
