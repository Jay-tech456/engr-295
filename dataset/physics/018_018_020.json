    "message_2": "The production of strange and multi-strange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions is an important topic in the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang. The beam energy in heavy-ion collisions plays a crucial role in the production of these particles.\n\nThe impact of beam energy on the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Higher beam energy leads to higher collision energy: As the beam energy increases, the energy available in the collision also increases. This results in a higher probability of producing strange and multi-strange hadrons, as the energy threshold for their production is surpassed.\n\n2. Increased production of strange quarks: At higher beam energies, the production of strange quarks becomes more likely due to the increased energy available in the collision. This leads to a higher probability of forming strange and multi-strange hadrons, as these particles contain strange quarks.\n\n3. Enhanced thermalization: At higher beam energies, the system formed in the collision reaches a higher degree of thermalization, which is a state where the system's constituents have reached a common temperature. In this state, the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons is enhanced due to the increased probability of strange quark-antiquark pairs being formed in the thermalized medium.\n\n4. Increased strangeness saturation: As the beam energy increases, the system formed in the collision becomes more saturated with strange quarks. This leads to an increased production of strange and multi-strange hadrons, as the probability of forming these particles from the available strange quarks becomes higher.\n\n5. Transition to a Quark-Gluon Plasma: At very high beam energies, the system formed in the collision is believed to undergo a phase transition to a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state where quarks and gluons are no longer confined within hadrons. In this state, the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons is expected to be significantly enhanced due to the increased availability of strange quarks and the reduced confinement of quarks within hadrons.\n\nIn summary, the beam energy in heavy-ion collisions has a significant impact on the production of strange and multi-strange hadrons. Higher beam energies generally lead to increased production of these particles due to factors such as increased collision energy, enhanced thermalization, increased strangeness saturation, and the possible transition to a Quark-Gluon Plasma."
