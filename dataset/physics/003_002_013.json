    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength inside a solenoid, we can use the formula:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current passing through the solenoid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of turns per unit length (n). We are given the total number of turns (N) and the length (L) of the solenoid:\n\nN = 300 turns\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m (converted to meters)\n\nNow, we can find n:\n\nn = N / L\nn = 300 turns / 0.1 m\nn = 3000 turns/m\n\nNext, we can plug the values into the formula for the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (3000 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB ≈ (12.566 × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) * (3000 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB ≈ 7.5398 × 10⁻³ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid is approximately 7.54 mT (millitesla)."
