    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2), and M is the total mass of the black holes in the system.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the masses of the black holes are:\n\nM1 = 30 solar masses = 30 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 5.967 x 10^31 kg\nM2 = 35 solar masses = 35 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 6.9615 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe total mass of the system is:\n\nM = M1 + M2 = 5.967 x 10^31 kg + 6.9615 x 10^31 kg = 12.9285 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf = (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2 * 12.9285 x 10^31 kg * π)\n\nf ≈ 74.9 Hz\n\nThis frequency is for the inspiral phase of the merger, where the black holes are orbiting each other. As the black holes merge, the frequency will increase. The peak frequency during the merger can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf_peak = c^3 / (6.355 * G * M)\n\nf_peak ≈ 118.6 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of 30 and 35 solar masses is approximately 74.9 Hz to 118.6 Hz. The distance of the black holes from Earth (1 billion light-years) does not affect the frequency of the gravitational waves, but it does affect the amplitude of the waves, making them weaker as they travel through space."
