    "message_2": "The Penrose process is a mechanism by which energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole. This process occurs in the ergosphere, a region outside the event horizon where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime along with it. In the Penrose process, a particle enters the ergosphere and splits into two particles. One of the particles falls into the black hole, while the other escapes to infinity. The escaping particle has more energy than the original particle, and this energy is extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole.\n\nThe efficiency of the Penrose process depends on the specific angular momentum of the black hole, which is determined by the ratio of the black hole's angular momentum (J) to its mass (M) squared. The maximum efficiency of the Penrose process can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - sqrt(1 - (J/M^2)^2)) * 100%\n\nFor a maximally rotating black hole (J/M^2 = 1), the maximum efficiency of the Penrose process is approximately 20.7%. This means that up to 20.7% of the mass-energy of the infalling particle can be converted into useful energy. However, this is an idealized scenario, and the actual efficiency of the Penrose process in a real astrophysical context would likely be lower due to various factors such as the distribution of particle trajectories and the presence of an accretion disk around the black hole."
