    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released during a nuclear explosion, we can use Einstein's famous equation:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass of the fissionable material, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy released if all the mass were converted into energy:\n\nE = (1 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1 kg * 9 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\nE = 9 x 10^16 Joules\n\nHowever, the efficiency of the explosion is only 50%, so we need to take that into account:\n\nE_released = 0.5 * E\nE_released = 0.5 * 9 x 10^16 Joules\nE_released = 4.5 x 10^16 Joules\n\nSo, the energy released during the nuclear explosion is 4.5 x 10^16 Joules."
