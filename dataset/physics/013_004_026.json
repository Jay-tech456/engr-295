    "message_2": "The presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster significantly affects the amount of gravitational lensing observed. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when the mass of an object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a more distant object, such as another galaxy or a quasar. This bending of light is due to the gravitational influence of the massive object, which causes the spacetime around it to curve, following the principles of general relativity.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect light. However, it does interact through gravity, and it is believed to make up a significant portion of the mass in galaxy clusters. In fact, dark matter is estimated to constitute around 85% of the total matter in the universe.\n\nThe presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster increases the total mass of the cluster, which in turn enhances the gravitational lensing effect. The more massive the galaxy cluster, the stronger the gravitational field it generates, and the more it can bend the light from background objects. This leads to more pronounced lensing effects, such as multiple images, arcs, or rings of the background objects.\n\nObservations of gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters provide crucial evidence for the existence of dark matter. By analyzing the lensing effects, astronomers can infer the distribution of mass within the cluster, including both the visible matter (stars, gas, etc.) and the invisible dark matter. This allows them to estimate the total mass of the cluster and the proportion of dark matter it contains.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark matter in a galaxy cluster significantly affects the amount of gravitational lensing observed, as it contributes to the total mass of the cluster and enhances the lensing effect. Studying gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters is a valuable tool for understanding the properties and distribution of dark matter in the universe."
