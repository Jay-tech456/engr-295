Additionally, plot the Hall resistance as a function of the magnetic field strength for a fixed electron density of 5 × 10¹⁵ m⁻² and temperatures of 10 Kelvin and 50 Kelvin.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Hall resistance, we can use the formula:\n\nHall resistance (R_H) = 1 / (q * n)\n\nwhere q is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) and n is the electron density (5 × 10¹⁵ m⁻²).\n\nR_H = 1 / (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C * 5 × 10¹⁵ m⁻²)\nR_H ≈ 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ Ω\n\nSo, the Hall resistance at a magnetic field strength of 5 tesla and a temperature of 10 Kelvin with an electron density of 5 × 10¹⁵ m⁻² is approximately 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ Ω.\n\nNow, let's plot the Hall resistance as a function of the magnetic field strength for a fixed electron density of 5 × 10¹⁵ m⁻² and temperatures of 10 Kelvin and 50 Kelvin.\n\nIn a two-dimensional electron gas, the Hall resistance does not depend on the temperature or the magnetic field strength. It only depends on the electron density. Therefore, the Hall resistance will remain constant at 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ Ω for both temperatures and all magnetic field strengths.\n\nTo plot this, you can create a graph with the magnetic field strength on the x-axis and the Hall resistance on the y-axis. Draw a horizontal line at 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ Ω for both 10 Kelvin and 50 Kelvin temperatures, indicating that the Hall resistance remains constant regardless of the magnetic field strength."
