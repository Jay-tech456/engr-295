    "message_2": "The energy difference between the spin-up and spin-down states of a proton in a magnetic field can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = μ * B\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, μ is the magnetic moment of the proton, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven the magnetic moment μ = 1.41 × 10^-26 J/T and the magnetic field strength B = 3.5 T, we can calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE = (1.41 × 10^-26 J/T) * (3.5 T)\n\nΔE = 4.935 × 10^-26 J\n\nThe energy difference between the proton's spin-up and spin-down states in the magnetic field is 4.935 × 10^-26 J."
