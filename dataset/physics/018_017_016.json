    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) and energy density (εc) required for the production of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are essential parameters for understanding the phase transition from hadronic matter to QGP.\n\nThe critical temperature Tc is estimated to be around 150-170 MeV (approximately 1.7-2.0 x 10^12 Kelvin) based on lattice QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) calculations. The critical energy density εc is estimated to be around 0.5-1.5 GeV/fm^3 (where fm stands for femtometers).\n\nThe production of QGP depends on the energy density achieved in the collision, which in turn depends on the colliding energy and atomic number of the colliding nuclei. As the colliding energy increases, the energy density in the collision region also increases, making it more likely to form QGP. Similarly, as the atomic number of the colliding nuclei increases, the number of nucleons participating in the collision increases, leading to a higher energy density and a higher probability of QGP formation.\n\nHowever, the exact dependence of the critical temperature and energy density on the colliding energy and atomic number of the colliding nuclei is not straightforward and requires complex theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. The study of QGP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is an ongoing area of research, and more precise values for these parameters may be determined as our understanding of QCD and the properties of QGP improves."
