    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the conductivity of a single graphene sheet is quite different from that of traditional metal conductors. Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It exhibits unique electronic properties due to its structure and the nature of the carbon-carbon bonds.\n\nIn traditional metal conductors, the conductivity typically decreases with increasing temperature. This is because metals have a lattice structure with positively charged ions surrounded by a sea of free electrons. As the temperature increases, the lattice ions vibrate more, leading to increased scattering of the free electrons and a decrease in conductivity.\n\nHowever, in graphene, the behavior is different. At low temperatures, graphene behaves as a semiconductor, and its conductivity increases with increasing temperature. This is because the charge carriers in graphene (electrons and holes) have a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation, which leads to a unique temperature dependence of the carrier density and mobility.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the number of thermally excited charge carriers increases, leading to an increase in conductivity. However, at higher temperatures, the increased lattice vibrations (phonons) can scatter the charge carriers, causing a decrease in their mobility. This results in a decrease in conductivity at very high temperatures.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the conductivity of a single graphene sheet is different from that of traditional metal conductors. At low temperatures, graphene's conductivity increases with temperature, while in metals, it decreases. At very high temperatures, both graphene and metal conductors experience a decrease in conductivity due to increased lattice vibrations and scattering of charge carriers."
