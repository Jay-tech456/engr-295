    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point on the z-axis that is a distance z above the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a circular loop of radius R in the xy-plane, we can parameterize the loop using the angle θ:\n\nx = R * cos(θ)\ny = R * sin(θ)\nz = 0\n\nThe infinitesimal length element dl can be expressed as:\n\ndl = R * dθ * êθ\n\nwhere êθ is the unit vector in the direction of increasing θ.\n\nThe position vector r from a point on the loop to the point on the z-axis is:\n\nr = R * cos(θ) * î + R * sin(θ) * ĵ + z * k\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √(R² * cos²(θ) + R² * sin²(θ) + z²) = √(R² + z²)\n\nNow we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (R * dθ * êθ) x (R * cos(θ) * î + R * sin(θ) * ĵ + z * k)\n\nThe only non-zero component of the cross product is in the k direction:\n\ndl x r = -R² * sin(θ) * cos(θ) * dθ * k\n\nNow we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-R² * sin(θ) * cos(θ) * dθ * k)) / (R² + z²)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at the point on the z-axis, we need to integrate dB over the entire loop (from θ = 0 to θ = 2π):\n\nB = ∫(dB) = (μ₀ * I * R² / 4π) * ∫(-sin(θ) * cos(θ) * dθ * k) / (R² + z²)^(3/2) from 0 to 2π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nu = cos(θ)\ndu = -sin(θ) * dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R² / 4π) * ∫(u * du * k) / (R² + z²)^(3/2) from u = 1 to u = -1\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R² / 4π) * k * [-1/2 * (R² + z²)^(-1/2)] from 1 to -1\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R² / 4π) * k * [1/√(R² + z²) - (-1/√(R² + z²))]\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R² / 2π) * k / √(R² + z²)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the z-axis that is a distance z above the center of the loop is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R² / 2π) * k / √(R² + z²)"
