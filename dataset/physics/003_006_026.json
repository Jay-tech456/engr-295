    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the coil, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nI = 2 A\nN = 200 turns\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 200 * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) * 2 * 200 * 0.0025) / (2 * (0.0025 + 0.01)^(3/2))\n\nB = (1.6π × 10^(-4)) / (2 * (0.0125)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the coil, 10 cm away from its center, is approximately 1.2566 × 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
