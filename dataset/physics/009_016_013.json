    "message_1": "A laser beam, having a wavelength of 650 nm, is directed onto a single slit of width 0.2 mm. If the distance from the slit to a screen is 2.5 m, what is the angular width of the central diffraction maximum on the screen?",
    "message_2": "To find the angular width of the central diffraction maximum, we can use the formula for the angular position of the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern:\n\nθ = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, m is the order of the minimum (m = 1 for the first minimum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength λ is given in nanometers (nm), so we need to convert it to meters:\n\nλ = 650 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 6.5 * 10^(-7) m\n\nThe width of the slit a is given in millimeters (mm), so we need to convert it to meters:\n\na = 0.2 mm * (1 m / 10^3 mm) = 2 * 10^(-4) m\n\nNow we can calculate the angular position of the first minimum:\n\nθ = (1 * 6.5 * 10^(-7) m) / (2 * 10^(-4) m) = 3.25 * 10^(-3) radians\n\nSince the central maximum extends from the first minimum on one side to the first minimum on the other side, the angular width of the central maximum is twice the angular position of the first minimum:\n\nAngular width = 2 * θ = 2 * 3.25 * 10^(-3) radians = 6.5 * 10^(-3) radians\n\nSo, the angular width of the central diffraction maximum on the screen is approximately 6.5 * 10^(-3) radians."
