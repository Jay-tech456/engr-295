How does this critical mass vary with changes in the star's composition and temperature?",
    "message_2": "The critical mass of a star required for it to undergo gravitational collapse and become a black hole can be estimated using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is the maximum mass that a stable, non-rotating neutron star can have before it collapses under its own gravity to form a black hole. This limit is approximately 2-3 solar masses (M☉), where 1 solar mass is the mass of our Sun (about 1.989 x 10^30 kg). However, this limit is for neutron stars, which are composed primarily of neutrons and are much denser than stars made up of hydrogen and helium.\n\nFor a star composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, the critical mass for gravitational collapse is significantly higher. The exact value depends on the star's internal structure, composition, and temperature, but it is generally accepted that a star must have a mass of at least 20 solar masses (M☉) to potentially form a black hole after going through a supernova explosion.\n\nThe critical mass for gravitational collapse can vary with changes in the star's composition and temperature. A star with a higher proportion of heavier elements (known as metallicity) will have a higher critical mass, as the increased pressure from the heavier elements can support a more massive star against gravitational collapse. Similarly, a higher temperature in the star's core will increase the pressure and radiation, allowing for a more massive star to be supported against collapse.\n\nIn summary, the critical mass of a star required for it to undergo gravitational collapse and become a black hole depends on its composition and temperature. For a star made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, the critical mass is generally accepted to be at least 20 solar masses (M☉). This value can vary with changes in the star's composition and temperature, with higher metallicity and temperature allowing for a more massive star to be supported against collapse."
