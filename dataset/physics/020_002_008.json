    "message_2": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories: a quantum field theory (QFT) and a string theory. The correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997 and has since become an essential tool in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of the strong force within hadrons.\n\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, the QFT is a conformal field theory (CFT) that lives on the boundary of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, while the string theory lives in the bulk of the AdS space. The holographic duality refers to the idea that the higher-dimensional string theory can be fully described by the lower-dimensional CFT on the boundary. This duality allows physicists to study strongly coupled systems in the CFT by examining their weakly coupled duals in the string theory.\n\nTo understand how the AdS/CFT correspondence can explain the strong force within a hadron, we must first discuss the behavior of quarks and gluons. Quarks are elementary particles that make up hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, and are bound together by the strong force, which is mediated by gluons. The strong force is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a non-abelian gauge theory that is inherently difficult to solve due to its non-perturbative nature at low energies.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence can be applied to QCD by considering a specific version of the duality, known as the AdS/QCD correspondence. In this case, the CFT on the boundary is a strongly coupled version of QCD, while the string theory in the bulk is a weakly coupled theory that can be more easily analyzed. By studying the behavior of strings and branes in the bulk, physicists can gain insights into the behavior of quarks and gluons in the strongly coupled QCD on the boundary.\n\nOne application of the AdS/QCD correspondence is the study of confinement, the phenomenon that quarks and gluons are never observed in isolation but are always confined within hadrons. In the bulk string theory, confinement can be understood as the formation of a \"flux tube\" or \"string\" between quarks, which is energetically favorable due to the properties of the AdS space. As the quarks are pulled apart, the energy stored in the flux tube increases, eventually leading to the creation of new quark-antiquark pairs and the formation of new hadrons. This behavior is consistent with the confinement observed in QCD.\n\nAnother application of the AdS/QCD correspondence is the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined within hadrons but instead form a strongly coupled fluid. By studying the behavior of black holes and other objects in the bulk string theory, physicists can gain insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, such as its viscosity and thermal conductivity.\n\nIn summary, the AdS/CFT correspondence provides a powerful tool for understanding the strong force within hadrons by relating the strongly coupled QCD on the boundary to a weakly coupled string theory in the bulk. This holographic duality allows physicists to study the behavior of quarks and gluons in a more tractable setting, leading to insights into confinement, the quark-gluon plasma, and other aspects of the strong force."
