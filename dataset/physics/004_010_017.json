    "message_2": "The event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon radius), G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 10 solar masses, we first need to convert this mass into kilograms. The mass of one solar mass (M_sun) is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole (M) is:\n\nM = 10 * M_sun = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nR_s = (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg)) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nR_s ≈ (2 * (6.674 x 10^-11) * (1.989 x 10^31)) / (9.0 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ (2.646 x 10^20) / (9.0 x 10^16)\n\nR_s ≈ 2.940 x 10^3 m\n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a non-rotating black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses is approximately 2,940 meters or 2.94 kilometers."
