The student also needs to calculate the critical angle of the optical fiber.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical fiber, we can use the following formula:\n\nNA = sqrt(n1^2 - n2^2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the core (1.5) and n2 is the refractive index of the cladding (1.45).\n\nNA = sqrt(1.5^2 - 1.45^2)\nNA = sqrt(2.25 - 2.1025)\nNA = sqrt(0.1475)\nNA ≈ 0.384\n\nThe numerical aperture of the optical fiber is approximately 0.384.\n\nTo calculate the critical angle (θc) for the optical fiber, we can use Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(θc) = n2 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nsin(θc) = n2 / n1\n\nsin(θc) = 1.45 / 1.5\nsin(θc) ≈ 0.9667\n\nNow, we can find the critical angle by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθc = arcsin(0.9667)\nθc ≈ 74.2°\n\nThe critical angle of the optical fiber is approximately 74.2 degrees."
