    "message_2": "The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, with a mass of about 173 GeV/c². Due to its large mass, it has a very short lifetime, on the order of 5x10⁻²⁵ seconds, which means it decays almost immediately after being produced. The primary decay mode of the top quark is into a W boson and a bottom quark, denoted as t → Wb.\n\nThe probability of this decay occurring can be expressed as the branching ratio, which is the fraction of the total decay rate for a particular decay mode. For the top quark decaying into a W boson and a bottom quark, the branching ratio is approximately 99.8%. This means that, in about 99.8% of the cases, a top quark will decay into a W boson and a bottom quark.\n\nThe branching ratio is determined by the fundamental properties of the particles involved and the interactions between them, which are described by the Standard Model of particle physics. In general, the branching ratio for a specific decay mode is not expected to change significantly under different experimental conditions, such as different collision energies or different final state particles. However, the production rate of top quarks and the overall event rates for different final states may vary depending on the experimental conditions.\n\nFor example, at higher collision energies, the production rate of top quarks may increase, leading to a larger number of top quark decays. Additionally, the probability of producing other final state particles may also change, which could affect the overall event rates for different final states. However, the branching ratio for the top quark decaying into a W boson and a bottom quark should remain approximately constant at 99.8%, as this is determined by the fundamental properties of the particles and their interactions."
