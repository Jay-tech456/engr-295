    "message_2": "To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the particle as seen by the observer, we first need to find the relativistic momentum of the particle. The relativistic momentum is given by the equation:\n\np = (m0 * v) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere p is the relativistic momentum, m0 is the rest mass of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the rest mass m0 = 2 GeV/c^2 (converting the mass to units of energy divided by the speed of light squared) and the velocity v = 0.8c, we can calculate the relativistic momentum:\n\np = (2 GeV/c^2 * 0.8c) / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\np = (1.6 GeV/c) / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\np = (1.6 GeV/c) / sqrt(0.36)\np = (1.6 GeV/c) / 0.6\np ≈ 2.67 GeV/c\n\nNow that we have the relativistic momentum, we can use the de Broglie wavelength equation to find the wavelength:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the de Broglie wavelength, h is the Planck's constant, and p is the relativistic momentum. The value of Planck's constant is approximately 4.135 x 10^(-15) eV*s.\n\nλ = (4.135 x 10^(-15) eV*s) / (2.67 GeV/c)\nλ = (4.135 x 10^(-15) eV*s) / (2.67 x 10^9 eV/c)\nλ ≈ 1.547 x 10^(-24) m\n\nSo, the de Broglie wavelength of the particle as seen by the observer is approximately 1.547 x 10^(-24) meters."
