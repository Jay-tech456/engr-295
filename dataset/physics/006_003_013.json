    "message_2": "To calculate the change in energy level for an electron in a hydrogen atom experiencing the Zeeman effect, we need to consider the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect can be expressed as:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_l\n\nwhere ΔE is the change in energy, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the external magnetic field, and m_l is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is given by:\n\nμ_B = (e * ħ) / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.055 x 10^-34 J s), and m_e is the electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.602 x 10^-19 C * 1.055 x 10^-34 J s) / (2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\n\nThe external magnetic field (B) is given as 1 Tesla.\n\nThe magnetic quantum number (m_l) can have integer values ranging from -l to +l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. For a hydrogen atom in its ground state, the electron is in the 1s orbital, which means l = 0. Therefore, m_l can only be 0 in this case.\n\nSince m_l = 0, the change in energy level (ΔE) due to the Zeeman effect will be:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_l\nΔE = 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T * 1 T * 0\nΔE = 0 J\n\nIn this case, there is no change in the energy level for an electron in a hydrogen atom experiencing the Zeeman effect when subjected to an external magnetic field of 1 Tesla. This is because the electron is in the 1s orbital, which has no magnetic quantum number other than 0."
