    "message_2": "To factorize a 2048-bit RSA key using Shor's algorithm, you would need a quantum computer with at least 2 * 2048 + 3 = 4099 qubits. This is because Shor's algorithm requires two quantum registers, each with the same number of qubits as the key size, plus a few extra qubits for ancillary operations.\n\nNow, let's consider the error rate and error-correcting qubits. Surface code is a popular error-correcting code for quantum computers, which can tolerate an error rate of up to 1% per gate if the code distance (d) is large enough. The probability of a logical error (P_logical) is related to the physical error rate (P_physical) and the code distance (d) by the following equation:\n\nP_logical ≈ P_physical^d\n\nGiven a 5% error rate per gate (P_physical = 0.05), we want to find the minimum code distance (d) such that the logical error rate is less than 1% (P_logical < 0.01). By trial and error, we find that d = 3 satisfies this condition:\n\nP_logical ≈ 0.05^3 ≈ 0.000125 < 0.01\n\nFor surface code, the number of error-correcting qubits required is proportional to the square of the code distance (d^2). In this case, we have:\n\nNumber of error-correcting qubits ≈ d^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\nHowever, this is a rough estimate, and the actual number of error-correcting qubits required may be higher due to the overhead of implementing the surface code.\n\nIn summary, to implement Shor's algorithm for factorizing a 2048-bit RSA key with a 1% chance of error using a surface code with a 5% error rate per gate, you would need a quantum computer with at least 4099 qubits, plus an additional number of error-correcting qubits, which is roughly estimated to be 9 qubits per logical qubit."
