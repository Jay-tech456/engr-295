    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is the third and heaviest charged lepton in the Standard Model of particle physics, following the electron (e) and the muon (μ). Here are the key properties of the tau lepton and how they differ from those of the other two charged leptons:\n\n1. Mass: The tau lepton has a mass of approximately 1.7768 GeV/c², which is significantly heavier than the electron (0.000511 GeV/c²) and the muon (0.1057 GeV/c²). Due to its larger mass, the tau lepton can decay into a wider range of particles compared to the electron and muon.\n\n2. Electric charge: All three charged leptons have the same electric charge of -1 elementary charge (e). This property does not differ among the three leptons.\n\n3. Lifetime: The tau lepton has a relatively short lifetime of about 2.9 x 10^(-13) seconds. This is shorter than the muon's lifetime (2.2 x 10^(-6) seconds) but longer than the electron's, which is considered stable on the timescales of the universe.\n\n4. Weak isospin: All three charged leptons have a weak isospin of -1/2, which means they interact via the weak nuclear force. This property does not differ among the three leptons.\n\n5. Lepton number: Each charged lepton has its own lepton number conservation. The tau lepton has a tau lepton number of +1, while the electron and muon have electron and muon lepton numbers of +1, respectively. These lepton numbers are conserved in particle interactions.\n\n6. Decay modes: Due to its larger mass, the tau lepton can decay into a variety of particles, including lighter leptons (electrons or muons), neutrinos, and hadrons (such as pions and kaons). The electron, being the lightest charged lepton, does not decay. The muon decays mainly into an electron and two neutrinos.\n\n7. Interaction with the Higgs field: All three charged leptons interact with the Higgs field, which gives them mass. However, the strength of this interaction is proportional to the mass of the lepton, so the tau lepton has the strongest interaction with the Higgs field among the three charged leptons.\n\nIn summary, the tau lepton is the heaviest and least stable of the three charged leptons in the Standard Model. It shares some properties with the electron and muon, such as electric charge and weak isospin, but its larger mass allows it to decay into a wider range of particles and interact more strongly with the Higgs field."
