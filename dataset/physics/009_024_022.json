    "message_1": "A physics student is given a polarizer that has a transmission axis making an angle of 30 degrees with the vertical axis. The light from a source with an intensity of 10 W/m² passes through the polarizer. What will be the intensity of the light that emerges from the polarizer?",
    "message_2": "To find the intensity of the light that emerges from the polarizer, we can use Malus's law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nMathematically, Malus's law is given by:\n\nI_t = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I₀ is the intensity of the incident light and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nI₀ = 10 W/m²\nθ = 30°\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can apply Malus's law to find the intensity of the transmitted light:\n\nI_t = 10 W/m² * cos²(π/6)\nI_t = 10 W/m² * (cos(π/6))^2\nI_t = 10 W/m² * (0.866)^2\nI_t ≈ 10 W/m² * 0.750\nI_t ≈ 7.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light that emerges from the polarizer is approximately 7.5 W/m²."
