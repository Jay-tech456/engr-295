    "message_2": "To calculate the efficiency of a gas diffusion method for isotope separation, we need to determine the separation factor (α). The separation factor is the ratio of the permeability of one gas to the permeability of another gas through a membrane.\n\nIn this case, we are given the pore size of the membrane (10^-6 m), the pressure difference (2 atm), and the temperature (300 K). We are also given that the gases involved are uranium hexafluoride (UF6) and helium (He).\n\nThe separation factor can be calculated using Graham's law of diffusion, which states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass:\n\nrate1 / rate2 = √(M2 / M1)\n\nwhere rate1 and rate2 are the diffusion rates of gas 1 and gas 2, and M1 and M2 are their respective molar masses.\n\nFor uranium hexafluoride (UF6), the molar mass is:\n\nM1 = 238 (U) + 6 * 19 (F) = 238 + 114 = 352 g/mol\n\nFor helium (He), the molar mass is:\n\nM2 = 4 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the separation factor (α):\n\nα = rate1 / rate2 = √(M2 / M1) = √(4 / 352) = √(1 / 88) ≈ 0.106\n\nThe separation factor for the gas diffusion process involving a membrane with a pore size of 10^-6 m, a pressure difference of 2 atm, a temperature of 300 K, and the gases uranium hexafluoride and helium is approximately 0.106. This means that helium will diffuse through the membrane about 10.6% faster than uranium hexafluoride."
