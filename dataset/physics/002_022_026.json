    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient of NaCl in the solution, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law. The Debye-Hückel limiting law is an equation that relates the mean ionic activity coefficient (γ±) to the ionic strength (I) of the solution. The equation is given by:\n\nlog(γ±) = -0.509 * √I\n\nFirst, we need to determine the ionic strength (I) of the solution. The ionic strength is calculated using the following formula:\n\nI = 1/2 * Σ(ci * z_i^2)\n\nwhere ci is the molar concentration of ion i and z_i is the charge of ion i.\n\nFor NaCl, the ions are Na+ and Cl-, and their charges are +1 and -1, respectively. The molar concentration of NaCl is 5 moles / 2 liters = 2.5 M. Since NaCl dissociates into one Na+ and one Cl- ion, the molar concentration of each ion is also 2.5 M.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionic strength:\n\nI = 1/2 * [(2.5 * (+1)^2) + (2.5 * (-1)^2)]\nI = 1/2 * (2.5 + 2.5)\nI = 2.5\n\nNow that we have the ionic strength, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficient:\n\nlog(γ±) = -0.509 * √2.5\nlog(γ±) ≈ -1.13\n\nTo find the activity coefficient (γ±), we take the antilog:\n\nγ± = 10^(-1.13)\nγ± ≈ 0.074\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of NaCl in the solution at 25°C is approximately 0.074."
