    "message_2": "The theoretical mass range for sterile neutrinos that could account for the observed dark matter in the universe is still an open question in particle physics and cosmology. However, there are some general guidelines based on experimental constraints and theoretical considerations.\n\nSterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak force, unlike the known active neutrinos. They could mix with active neutrinos through a process called neutrino oscillations, which would allow them to have a small but non-zero interaction with normal matter. This mixing is characterized by a parameter called the mixing angle, which is constrained by experimental data.\n\nThere are two main mass ranges for sterile neutrinos that are considered as potential dark matter candidates:\n\n1. keV-scale sterile neutrinos: These have masses in the range of 1-100 keV (kilo-electron volts). They are also known as \"warm dark matter\" candidates because their velocities are relatively high, leading to a more diffuse distribution of dark matter in the universe. The current experimental constraints on their mixing angles are relatively weak, allowing for a wide range of possible sterile neutrino properties. However, astrophysical observations, such as the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and the cosmic X-ray background, can provide additional constraints on their properties.\n\n2. eV-scale sterile neutrinos: These have masses in the range of 0.01-10 eV (electron volts). They are also known as \"cold dark matter\" candidates because their velocities are relatively low, leading to a more clustered distribution of dark matter in the universe. The current experimental constraints on their mixing angles are much stronger, making it more challenging for these particles to account for the observed dark matter. However, there is still some room for eV-scale sterile neutrinos to exist within the allowed parameter space.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical mass range for sterile neutrinos that could account for the observed dark matter in the universe is not yet precisely determined, but it is generally thought to lie within the keV or eV scale. Further experimental and observational data will be needed to narrow down the possible mass range and mixing angles for these elusive particles."
