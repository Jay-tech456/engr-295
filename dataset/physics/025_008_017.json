    "message_2": "To calculate the force generated by the contraction of a single muscle fiber, you can use the following formula:\n\nForce (F) = Cross-sectional area (A) × Tension (T)\n\nHere, the cross-sectional area is given in square meters (m²) and the tension is given in pascals (Pa). The resulting force will be in newtons (N).\n\nSo, if you have the cross-sectional area and the tension the muscle fiber can generate, you can simply multiply these two values to find the force generated by the contraction."
