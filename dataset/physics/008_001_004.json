    "message_2": "The mass of the Higgs boson is approximately 125.1 GeV/cÂ² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), which is equivalent to about 2.24 x 10^-25 kg. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\n\nThe Higgs boson interacts with other particles in the Standard Model of particle physics through the Higgs field. The Higgs field is a scalar field that permeates all of space, and its interaction with particles gives them mass. The more a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more mass it acquires.\n\nWhen particles pass through the Higgs field, they can interact with the Higgs bosons, which are the excitations (or quanta) of the field. This interaction is responsible for the mass of particles like quarks, leptons, and the W and Z bosons, which are responsible for the weak nuclear force. The Higgs boson does not interact with massless particles like photons and gluons.\n\nThe Higgs boson's interaction with other particles is mediated by the weak nuclear force, which is one of the four fundamental forces in nature. The weak force is responsible for processes like beta decay and plays a crucial role in the fusion reactions that power the sun."
