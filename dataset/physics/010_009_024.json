    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure drop along the pipe due to friction, we can use the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\nΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρv²/2)\n\nwhere ΔP is the pressure drop, f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the length of the pipe, D is the diameter of the pipe, ρ is the fluid density, and v is the fluid velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Reynolds number (Re) to determine the flow regime and calculate the Darcy friction factor (f). The Reynolds number is given by:\n\nRe = (ρvD)/μ\n\nwhere μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nRe = (900 kg/m³ * 0.1 m/s * 0.05 m) / (0.05 Pa·s)\nRe = 450\n\nSince the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is considered laminar. For laminar flow, the Darcy friction factor can be calculated as:\n\nf = 16 / Re\nf = 16 / 450\nf = 0.03556\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure drop using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\nΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρv²/2)\nΔP = 0.03556 * (10 m / 0.05 m) * (900 kg/m³ * (0.1 m/s)² / 2)\nΔP = 0.03556 * 200 * (9 kg·m/s²)\nΔP = 63.504 Pa\n\nThe pressure drop along 10 m of the pipe due to friction is approximately 63.5 Pa."
