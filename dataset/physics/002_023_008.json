    "message_2": "To find the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P2 is the vapor pressure at temperature T2, P1 is the vapor pressure at temperature T1, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the ideal gas constant, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nThe ideal gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/(mol*K).\n\nWe need a reference point for the vapor pressure of water at a known temperature. A common reference point is the normal boiling point of water, which is 100°C (373.15 K) with a vapor pressure of 1 atm (101.325 kPa).\n\nT1 = 373.15 K\nP1 = 101.325 kPa\n\nWe want to find the vapor pressure at 80°C, so we need to convert that to Kelvin:\n\nT2 = 80°C + 273.15 = 353.15 K\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101.325) = -40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (1/353.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101.325 * exp(-40700 / 8.314 * (1/353.15 - 1/373.15))\nP2 ≈ 47.39 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 80°C is approximately 47.39 kPa."
