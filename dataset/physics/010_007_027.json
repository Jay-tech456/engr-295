    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the block, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. \n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the cube-shaped block:\nVolume = side^3 = 2m * 2m * 2m = 8 m³\n\nNow, let's find the mass of the block:\nMass = Density * Volume = 800 kg/m³ * 8 m³ = 6400 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the fluid displaced by the block. To do this, we'll use the volume of the block and the density of the liquid:\nDisplaced fluid mass = Liquid density * Block volume = 1000 kg/m³ * 8 m³ = 8000 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the displaced fluid, which is equal to the buoyant force:\nBuoyant force = Displaced fluid mass * g (acceleration due to gravity)\nAssuming g = 9.81 m/s²,\nBuoyant force = 8000 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 78,480 N\n\nSo, the buoyant force acting on the block when it is immersed in the liquid with a density of 1000 kg/m³ is 78,480 N."
