    "message_2": "To prevent flow separation from occurring on the top surface of a wing, we need to ensure that the flow remains attached to the wing surface. One way to do this is by maintaining a sufficient velocity to keep the boundary layer energized and delay the onset of separation.\n\nWe can use the Kutta-Joukowski theorem to estimate the lift coefficient (Cl) for the given wing geometry:\n\nCl = 2 * pi * (angle of attack + camber)\n\nwhere angle of attack is given in radians, and camber is given as a fraction of the chord length. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle of attack from degrees to radians:\n\nangle of attack (radians) = 10 degrees * (pi / 180) ≈ 0.1745 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the lift coefficient:\n\nCl = 2 * pi * (0.1745 + 0.05) ≈ 1.407\n\nNext, we can use the lift equation to find the dynamic pressure (q) required to generate this lift coefficient:\n\nLift = 0.5 * air_density * velocity^2 * chord_length * Cl\n\nSince we want to find the minimum velocity required, we can assume that the lift generated is equal to the weight of the wing. Let's denote the weight of the wing as W. Then:\n\nW = 0.5 * 1.2 kg/m³ * velocity^2 * 1 m * 1.407\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum velocity:\n\nvelocity^2 = W / (0.5 * 1.2 kg/m³ * 1 m * 1.407)\nvelocity = sqrt(W / (0.5 * 1.2 kg/m³ * 1 m * 1.407))\n\nSince we don't have the weight of the wing (W), we cannot provide a specific value for the minimum velocity. However, you can use the above equation to find the minimum velocity once you have the weight of the wing."
