    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, light passes through two closely spaced slits and creates an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits. This interference pattern is a result of the superposition of light waves from the two slits, which can constructively or destructively interfere with each other depending on their phase difference when they reach the screen.\n\nThe distance between the two slits plays a crucial role in determining the characteristics of the interference pattern. To understand this, let's consider the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes (constructive interference) in the interference pattern:\n\nθ = arcsin(m * λ / d)\n\nwhere:\n- θ is the angular position of the bright fringe\n- m is the order of the fringe (0 for the central maximum, 1 for the first-order maximum, and so on)\n- λ is the wavelength of the light\n- d is the distance between the two slits\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that as the distance between the slits (d) increases, the angular separation between the bright fringes (θ) decreases. This means that the interference pattern will become more closely spaced as the distance between the slits increases.\n\nIn terms of the linear position of the bright fringes on the screen, the formula is:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nwhere:\n- y is the linear position of the bright fringe on the screen\n- L is the distance between the double-slit and the screen\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that as the distance between the slits (d) increases, the linear separation between the bright fringes (y) decreases, provided that the distance between the double-slit and the screen (L) remains constant.\n\nIn summary, increasing the distance between the two slits in a double-slit experiment will result in a more closely spaced interference pattern on the screen. Conversely, decreasing the distance between the slits will result in a more widely spaced interference pattern."
