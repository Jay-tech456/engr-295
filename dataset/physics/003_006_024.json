    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nFor the initial case with a current of 2 A and a radius of 0.1 m:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\nB ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-5) T\n\nNow, if the current is increased to 4 A, we can use the same formula:\n\nB_new = (μ₀ * I_new) / (2 * R)\nB_new = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\nB_new = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\nB_new ≈ 2.5132 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the loop when the current is 2 A is approximately 1.2566 × 10^(-5) T, and when the current is increased to 4 A, the magnetic field becomes approximately 2.5132 × 10^(-5) T."
