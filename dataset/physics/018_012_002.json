    "message_2": "Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with the highest energy and shortest wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. There is no theoretical upper limit to the energy of gamma rays, but practically, the highest energy gamma rays observed so far are in the range of several hundred tera-electronvolts (TeV) or even peta-electronvolts (PeV) in some cases.\n\nHigh-energy gamma rays are produced in various astrophysical sources, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). These sources involve extreme physical processes that can accelerate particles to very high energies, which then produce gamma rays through different mechanisms.\n\n1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): AGN are powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The accretion of matter onto the black hole releases enormous amounts of energy, which can accelerate particles to relativistic speeds. These particles can then interact with surrounding magnetic fields, photons, or other particles, producing gamma rays through processes such as:\n\n   a. Synchrotron radiation: Charged particles (e.g., electrons) moving in magnetic fields emit radiation, including gamma rays, due to their acceleration.\n\n   b. Inverse Compton scattering: High-energy electrons can transfer their energy to lower-energy photons (e.g., visible light or X-rays), upscattering them to gamma-ray energies.\n\n   c. Hadronic processes: High-energy protons can interact with other particles (e.g., protons or photons) to produce pions, which then decay into gamma rays.\n\n2. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): GRBs are extremely energetic explosions, usually associated with the collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects (e.g., neutron stars). These events produce highly relativistic jets, which can generate gamma rays through similar processes as in AGN, such as synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, the decay of radioactive isotopes produced in the explosion can also contribute to the gamma-ray emission.\n\nIn summary, the maximum energy of gamma rays is not theoretically limited, but the highest energy gamma rays observed so far are in the range of several hundred TeV or even PeV. High-energy gamma rays are produced in astrophysical sources like AGN and GRBs through various processes, including synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and hadronic interactions."
