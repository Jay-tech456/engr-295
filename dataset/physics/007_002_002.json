    "message_1": "What is the half-life of a radioactive material that started with 100 grams and decayed to 25 grams in 20 years? If the material has a decay constant of 0.01 per year, how much of the material will remain after 40 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of the radioactive material, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the material remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount of the material, T is the half-life, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n25 grams = 100 grams * (1/2)^(20 years / T)\n\nDivide both sides by 100 grams:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(20 years / T)\n\nNow, take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(0.25) = (20 years / T) * log(1/2)\n\nSolve for T:\n\nT = (20 years * log(1/2)) / log(0.25)\n\nT ≈ 10 years\n\nSo, the half-life of the radioactive material is approximately 10 years.\n\nNow, to find the amount of the material remaining after 40 years, we can use the decay constant formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the material remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount of the material, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN(40) = 100 grams * e^(-0.01 per year * 40 years)\n\nN(40) ≈ 100 grams * e^(-0.4)\n\nN(40) ≈ 100 grams * 0.67032\n\nN(40) ≈ 67.03 grams\n\nSo, approximately 67.03 grams of the material will remain after 40 years."
