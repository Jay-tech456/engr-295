    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the radius r = 0.2 meters and the current I = 4 amps, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.2 m)\n\nB = (16π × 10⁻⁷ T·m) / (0.4π m)\n\nB = (16 × 10⁻⁷ T) / 0.4\n\nB = 40 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB = 4 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular loop is 4 × 10⁻⁶ Tesla."
