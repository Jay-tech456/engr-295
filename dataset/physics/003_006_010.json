    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop of wire, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and R is the radius of the loop.\n\nGiven the current I = 5 A and the radius R = 0.1 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at the center of the circular loop of wire is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T (tesla)."
