    "message_2": "The rotation curve of a galaxy represents the variation of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in the galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. In order to determine the expected rotation curves for different types of galaxies based on their mass distribution, we can use the concept of spherical symmetry and Newton's law of gravitation.\n\nFor a spherically symmetric mass distribution, the gravitational force acting on a test mass (e.g., a star) at a distance r from the center of the galaxy can be determined using the following equation:\n\nF = G * (M(r) * m) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, M(r) is the mass enclosed within the radius r, and m is the test mass.\n\nThe centripetal force required for the test mass to maintain a circular orbit around the galaxy's center is given by:\n\nFc = m * v^2 / r\n\nwhere Fc is the centripetal force and v is the orbital velocity of the test mass.\n\nIn a stable orbit, the gravitational force and the centripetal force must balance each other:\n\nG * (M(r) * m) / r^2 = m * v^2 / r\n\nSolving for the orbital velocity v, we get:\n\nv(r) = sqrt(G * M(r) / r)\n\nNow, let's consider different types of galaxies and their mass distributions:\n\n1. Elliptical galaxies: These galaxies have a smooth, spherically symmetric distribution of mass, with most of the mass concentrated towards the center. The mass distribution can be described by a de Vaucouleurs profile or a Sersic profile. As a result, the expected rotation curve for elliptical galaxies would show a steep increase in orbital velocity near the center, followed by a gradual decline at larger radii.\n\n2. Spiral galaxies: These galaxies have a flattened disk-like structure with a central bulge and spiral arms. The mass distribution can be modeled as a combination of a spherically symmetric bulge (similar to elliptical galaxies) and an exponential disk. The expected rotation curve for spiral galaxies would show an initial increase in orbital velocity near the center (due to the bulge), followed by a roughly constant or slowly declining velocity at larger radii (due to the disk).\n\n3. Dwarf galaxies: These are small, low-mass galaxies with irregular shapes and mass distributions. Their mass distribution can be modeled using a Plummer profile or an exponential profile. The expected rotation curve for dwarf galaxies would show a gradual increase in orbital velocity with increasing radius, followed by a decline at larger radii.\n\nWhen comparing these theoretical rotation curves to observations, we find discrepancies, particularly in the case of spiral galaxies. Observations show that the rotation curves of spiral galaxies remain flat or even slightly rising at large radii, instead of declining as expected from the visible mass distribution. This discrepancy is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter, which is believed to form an extended, spherically symmetric halo around galaxies, providing the additional mass needed to explain the observed rotation curves."
