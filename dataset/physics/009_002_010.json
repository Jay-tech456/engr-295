    "message_1": "A physics student needs to find the angle of refraction of a light ray traveling from air into an acrylic block with an incident angle of 60 degrees. The refractive index of acrylic is 1.49. What formula can be used to calculate the angle of refraction? What is the angle of refraction?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction, we can use Snell's Law, which is given by the formula:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media (air and acrylic), θ1 is the angle of incidence (60 degrees), and θ2 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 (air) = 1, n2 (acrylic) = 1.49, and θ1 = 60 degrees. We want to find θ2.\n\n1 * sin(60) = 1.49 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(60) = 0.866\n\n0.866 = 1.49 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.49:\n\n0.866 / 1.49 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.5812 = sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.5812)\n\nθ2 ≈ 36.1 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of refraction is approximately 36.1 degrees."
