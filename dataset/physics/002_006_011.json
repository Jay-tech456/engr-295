    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the combustion of methane, we can use the following equation:\n\n∆G = ∆H - T∆S\n\nwhere ∆G is the change in Gibbs free energy, ∆H is the change in enthalpy (heat of combustion), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ∆S is the change in entropy.\n\nGiven values:\n∆H = -890.3 kJ/mol\n∆S = -242.8 J/mol*K\nT = 298 K\n\nFirst, we need to convert ∆S to kJ/mol*K:\n\n∆S = -242.8 J/mol*K × (1 kJ / 1000 J) = -0.2428 kJ/mol*K\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n∆G = (-890.3 kJ/mol) - (298 K × -0.2428 kJ/mol*K)\n∆G = -890.3 kJ/mol + (72.2752 kJ/mol)\n∆G = -818.0248 kJ/mol\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for the combustion of methane at 298 K and 1 atm is approximately -818.0 kJ/mol."
