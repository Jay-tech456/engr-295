    "message_2": "To calculate the rotational velocity of the Milky Way's galactic disk at a distance of 40,000 light-years from the galactic center, we can use the following equation:\n\nv_rot = v_obs / sin(i)\n\nwhere v_rot is the rotational velocity, v_obs is the observed radial velocity, and i is the inclination angle between the line of sight and the plane of the galactic disk.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inclination angle (i). We can do this by using the given average rotational velocity (v_avg) and the observed radial velocity (v_obs):\n\nsin(i) = v_obs / v_avg\n\nsin(i) = 200 km/s / 220 km/s\nsin(i) = 0.9091\n\nNow, we can find the inclination angle (i) by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\ni = arcsin(0.9091)\ni ≈ 64.42°\n\nNow that we have the inclination angle, we can calculate the rotational velocity (v_rot):\n\nv_rot = v_obs / sin(i)\nv_rot = 200 km/s / sin(64.42°)\nv_rot ≈ 221.8 km/s\n\nTherefore, the rotational velocity of the Milky Way's galactic disk at a distance of 40,000 light-years from the galactic center is approximately 221.8 km/s."
