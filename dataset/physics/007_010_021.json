    "message_2": "To determine the approximate yield of a nuclear bomb that releases 2.5 x 10^17 joules of energy, we can compare it to the energy released by TNT, which is a common reference for explosive energy.\n\nOne ton of TNT releases approximately 4.184 x 10^9 joules of energy. To find the equivalent yield in tons of TNT, we can divide the energy released by the nuclear bomb by the energy released by one ton of TNT:\n\n(2.5 x 10^17 joules) / (4.184 x 10^9 joules/ton) â‰ˆ 5.98 x 10^7 tons of TNT\n\nSo, the approximate yield of the nuclear bomb is about 59.8 million tons of TNT.\n\nThis is an enormous amount of energy compared to a typical chemical explosion. For example, the largest non-nuclear explosion in history, the Halifax Explosion in 1917, released an estimated 2.9 kilotons of TNT equivalent energy. The nuclear bomb's energy release in this case is more than 20,000 times greater than the Halifax Explosion."
