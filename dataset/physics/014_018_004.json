    "message_2": "The maximum amount of time a human astronaut can safely spend in space depends on several factors, including the type of spacecraft, the shielding provided, and the individual's health and age. However, a general guideline is based on the radiation exposure limits set by various space agencies.\n\nNASA has established a career limit for astronauts' radiation exposure, which is based on age and gender. This limit is set to ensure that the astronaut's risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to radiation-induced cancer does not exceed 3%. For a 35-year-old male astronaut, the limit is approximately 1,000 millisieverts (mSv), while for a 35-year-old female astronaut, it is around 800 mSv.\n\nOn the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts receive an average dose of about 150-200 mSv per year. Based on these numbers, an astronaut could potentially spend around 5 years on the ISS without exceeding the radiation exposure limits. However, this is a simplified estimation and doesn't account for other health risks associated with long-duration spaceflight, such as bone density loss, muscle atrophy, and psychological effects.\n\nFor deep space missions, such as a trip to Mars, the radiation exposure would be significantly higher due to the lack of Earth's protective magnetic field. In such cases, the mission duration would need to be shorter to stay within the radiation exposure limits, and advanced shielding technologies would be required to protect the astronauts from harmful cosmic rays.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum amount of time a human astronaut can safely spend in space depends on various factors, but for missions within Earth's orbit, it could be up to 5 years based on radiation exposure limits. For deep space missions, the duration would be shorter and would require advanced shielding technologies to ensure astronauts' safety."
