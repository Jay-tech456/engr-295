    "message_1": "What is the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves that would be detectable from a population of primordial black holes in the mass range of 10-1000 times the mass of the sun, and how would the detectability depend on the distance of the black holes from Earth?",
    "message_2": "The amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves from primordial black holes depend on their masses and the dynamics of their interactions. For a pair of black holes in a binary system, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G * (5/256 * t))^(-3/8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the black holes merge. The masses of the black holes also play a role in determining the frequency.\n\nFor the mass range of 10-1000 solar masses, the frequency of gravitational waves would typically lie in the range of 10 Hz to a few kHz. This range is well-suited for detection by ground-based gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the masses of the black holes and their distance from the Earth. The amplitude can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * c^(-2)) / r\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, M is the total mass of the black hole system, and r is the distance from the Earth to the black holes.\n\nAs the distance from the Earth to the black holes increases, the amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases. This means that the detectability of the gravitational waves depends on the sensitivity of the detectors and the distance to the black holes. Current detectors like LIGO and Virgo can detect gravitational waves from black hole mergers up to a distance of about 10 Gpc (gigaparsecs) for high-mass black hole systems.\n\nIn summary, the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves from primordial black holes in the mass range of 10-1000 solar masses would be detectable by current ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo. The detectability of these gravitational waves depends on the distance of the black holes from Earth, with greater distances leading to lower amplitudes and reduced detectability."
