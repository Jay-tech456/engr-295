    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy has a significant impact on its rotation curve, which is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galactic center. The presence and distribution of dark matter can help explain the observed discrepancies between the expected rotation curves based on visible matter and the actual observed rotation curves.\n\nAccording to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity of stars and gas in a galaxy should decrease as their distance from the galactic center increases, similar to how planets in our solar system orbit the Sun. However, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotation curves remain relatively flat or even slightly increase with distance from the center, indicating that there is more mass present than what is visible in the form of stars, gas, and dust.\n\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light and is thus invisible to telescopes. Dark matter is believed to make up approximately 85% of the total matter in the universe. Its gravitational influence on visible matter in galaxies causes the observed flat rotation curves.\n\nThe distribution of dark matter in a galaxy is typically modeled as a dark matter halo, which is an extended, roughly spherical distribution of dark matter surrounding the visible galactic disk. The density of dark matter in the halo decreases with increasing distance from the galactic center. This distribution of dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to explain the observed flat rotation curves.\n\nObservations of the rotation curves of galaxies can provide valuable information about the amount and distribution of dark matter within them. By comparing the observed rotation curves with those predicted by various dark matter distribution models, astronomers can constrain the properties of dark matter halos, such as their mass, size, and density profile. This, in turn, helps improve our understanding of the nature and properties of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies."
