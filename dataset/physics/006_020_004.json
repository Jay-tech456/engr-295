    "message_2": "The Mott scattering cross section formula for an unpolarized electron beam is given by:\n\nσ_Mott = (α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * (1 + cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere:\nα is the fine structure constant (approximately 1/137),\nZ is the atomic number of the target (for hydrogen, Z = 1),\ne is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^(-19) C),\nε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (approximately 8.85 × 10^(-12) C^2 / N m^2),\nE is the energy of the incident electron beam (10 keV = 10 × 10^3 eV),\nθ is the scattering angle.\n\nHowever, to find the total Mott scattering cross section, we need to integrate the differential cross section over all possible scattering angles (from 0 to π). The total cross section is given by:\n\nσ_total = ∫[σ_Mott * sin(θ) dθ] from 0 to π\n\nσ_total = ∫[(α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * (1 + cos^2(θ)) * sin(θ) dθ] from 0 to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = cos(θ), then du = -sin(θ) dθ. The integral becomes:\n\nσ_total = - ∫[(α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * (1 + u^2) du] from 1 to -1\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nσ_total = - (α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * ∫(1 + u^2) du from 1 to -1\n\nσ_total = - (α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * [u + (u^3 / 3)] from 1 to -1\n\nσ_total = - (α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * [(1 + 1/3) - (-1 - 1/3)]\n\nσ_total = (α * Z * e^2 / (4 * π * ε_0 * E))^2 * (8/3)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nσ_total = (1/137 * 1 * (1.6 × 10^(-19))^2 / (4 * π * 8.85 × 10^(-12) * 10 × 10^3))^2 * (8/3)\n\nσ_total ≈ 1.44 × 10^(-30) m^2\n\nSo, the Mott scattering cross section for a beam of electrons with energy E = 10 keV incident on a hydrogen atom in its ground state is approximately 1.44 × 10^(-30) square meters."
