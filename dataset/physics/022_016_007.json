    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity. They have been proposed as a possible candidate for dark matter, which is an unknown form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content.\n\nThe mass range of sterile neutrinos that could potentially explain the observed dark matter in the universe is still uncertain, as there is no direct detection of these particles yet. However, based on current observational data and theoretical models, we can estimate the mass range.\n\nOne of the primary constraints on the mass of sterile neutrinos comes from the Tremaine-Gunn bound, which is based on the phase-space density of dark matter in dwarf galaxies. This bound suggests that the mass of sterile neutrinos should be greater than 1 keV (kilo-electronvolt).\n\nAnother constraint comes from the Lyman-alpha forest observations, which provide information on the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the universe. These observations suggest that the mass of sterile neutrinos should be less than 50 keV to avoid suppressing the formation of small-scale structures in the universe.\n\nAdditionally, X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and the cosmic X-ray background provide further constraints on the mass of sterile neutrinos. These observations suggest that the mass of sterile neutrinos should be less than 7 keV to avoid producing an observable X-ray line.\n\nTaking these constraints into account, the mass range of sterile neutrinos that could potentially explain the observed dark matter in the universe is approximately between 1 keV and 7 keV. However, it is important to note that this mass range is still uncertain and subject to change as new observational data and theoretical models become available."
