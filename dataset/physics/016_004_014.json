    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field strength (Hc) required to destroy superconductivity in a Type I superconductor can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nHc = (Φ0 * κ) / (2 * π * ξ^2)\n\nwhere Φ0 is the magnetic flux quantum (approximately 2.07 × 10^(-15) Tm^2), κ is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, and ξ is the superconducting coherence length.\n\nType I superconductors have a single critical magnetic field strength (Hc) beyond which superconductivity is destroyed. When the applied magnetic field exceeds Hc, the superconductor transitions into a normal (non-superconducting) state.\n\nType II superconductors, on the other hand, have two critical magnetic field strengths: Hc1 and Hc2. When the applied magnetic field is between Hc1 and Hc2, the superconductor enters a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) where magnetic flux penetrates the material in the form of quantized vortices. Superconductivity is not completely destroyed in this state, but the material exhibits both superconducting and normal regions. When the applied magnetic field exceeds Hc2, the superconductor transitions into a normal state, and superconductivity is destroyed.\n\nIn general, Type II superconductors can withstand much higher magnetic field strengths than Type I superconductors before losing their superconducting properties. This is due to the mixed state that allows them to partially accommodate the applied magnetic field. The specific values of Hc, Hc1, and Hc2 depend on the material and temperature, but the key difference is that Type II superconductors have a broader range of magnetic field strengths in which they can maintain some degree of superconductivity, while Type I superconductors have a single critical value beyond which superconductivity is lost."
