    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature and enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nGiven:\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol\nP1 = 101.3 kPa\nT1 = 100°C = 373.15 K (converted to Kelvin by adding 273.15)\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K (converted to Kelvin by adding 273.15)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nWe want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 50°C.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for P2:\n\nP2 = P1 * exp(-ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(-40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (1/323.15 K - 1/373.15 K))\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(-40,700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (-0.000802 K⁻¹))\n\nP2 = 101.3 kPa * exp(3.898)\n\nP2 ≈ 101.3 kPa * 49.4\n\nP2 ≈ 5000 kPa\n\nThe vapor pressure of water at 50°C is approximately 5000 kPa."
