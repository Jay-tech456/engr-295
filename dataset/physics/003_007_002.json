    "message_1": "What is the magnetic field at point P located at a distance of 5 cm from a straight rod 10 cm long carrying a current of 2 A, oriented perpendicular to the plane containing the rod and point P? Assume a vacuum medium with μ₀=4π×10⁻⁷ Tm/A.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the rod is straight and the current is uniform, we can simplify the Biot-Savart law by integrating along the length of the rod. Let's place the rod along the y-axis with one end at y = 0 and the other end at y = 10 cm. Point P is located at (0, 0, 5 cm) in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe differential length vector dl = (0, dy, 0), and the position vector r = (0, y, -5 cm). The cross product dl x r = (5dy, 0, 0), and |r|^3 = (y^2 + 5^2)^(3/2).\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart law and integrate along the length of the rod:\n\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * dl x r) / |r|^3\nB = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(2 * (5dy, 0, 0)) / (y^2 + 5^2)^(3/2) from y = 0 to y = 10 cm\n\nThe magnetic field has only an x-component, so we can focus on that:\n\nBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(10dy) / (y^2 + 5^2)^(3/2) from y = 0 to y = 10 cm\n\nNow we can perform the integration:\n\nBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * [arctan(y/5)] from y = 0 to y = 10 cm\nBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * [arctan(10/5) - arctan(0)]\nBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * arctan(2)\n\nNow we can substitute the value of μ₀:\n\nBx = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A / 4π) * arctan(2)\nBx ≈ 10⁻⁷ T * arctan(2)\n\nBx ≈ 1.03 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1.03 × 10⁻⁷ T in the x-direction."
