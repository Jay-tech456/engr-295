    "message_2": "The conversion of glucose into lactate during glycolysis can be represented by the following reaction:\n\nC6H12O6 (glucose) + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 CH3CH(OH)COOH (lactate) + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 ATP\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy (∆G) for this reaction under standard conditions (∆G°) is approximately -146 kJ/mol. However, the actual ∆G in cellular conditions can vary depending on the concentrations of the reactants and products.\n\nThe negative value of ∆G indicates that the reaction is spontaneous and exergonic, meaning it releases energy. This is consistent with the fact that glycolysis is a catabolic pathway that generates ATP, which is used as an energy source by cells.\n\nThe efficiency of the reaction can be assessed by comparing the amount of energy released during the conversion of glucose into lactate to the amount of energy stored in the form of ATP. The standard free energy change for the hydrolysis of ATP is approximately -30.5 kJ/mol. Since glycolysis generates 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, the total energy stored in ATP is about -61 kJ/mol. Therefore, the efficiency of the reaction can be estimated as:\n\nEfficiency = (Energy stored in ATP / Energy released during the reaction) × 100\nEfficiency ≈ (-61 kJ/mol / -146 kJ/mol) × 100 ≈ 41.8%\n\nThis means that about 41.8% of the energy released during the conversion of glucose into lactate is stored in the form of ATP, while the rest is dissipated as heat. The directionality of the reaction is determined by the negative ∆G value, which indicates that the reaction proceeds spontaneously from glucose to lactate under the given conditions."
