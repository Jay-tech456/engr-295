    "message_2": "The cosmological constant problem is one of the most significant unsolved problems in theoretical physics. It is deeply rooted in the context of general relativity, quantum field theory, and our understanding of the universe's expansion. The problem has evolved over time, and our current understanding is still incomplete.\n\nIn the context of general relativity, the cosmological constant (denoted by Λ) was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1917. At that time, the prevailing belief was that the universe was static, neither expanding nor contracting. Einstein added the cosmological constant to his field equations as a repulsive force to counterbalance the attractive force of gravity, thereby maintaining a stable, static universe.\n\nHowever, in 1929, Edwin Hubble's observations of distant galaxies revealed that the universe was actually expanding. This discovery led Einstein to abandon the cosmological constant, calling it his \"biggest blunder.\" For several decades, the cosmological constant was largely ignored in cosmology.\n\nThe situation changed in the late 20th century when new observations of distant supernovae provided strong evidence for an accelerating expansion of the universe. This acceleration could be explained by reintroducing the cosmological constant as a form of \"dark energy\" that drives the expansion. The current standard model of cosmology, known as the ΛCDM model, includes the cosmological constant as a key component, accounting for about 70% of the total energy density of the universe.\n\nThe cosmological constant problem arises when we try to reconcile general relativity with quantum field theory. In quantum field theory, the vacuum of space is not empty but filled with fluctuating quantum fields that contribute to the vacuum energy density. This vacuum energy should act as a form of dark energy and contribute to the cosmological constant.\n\nHowever, when we calculate the vacuum energy density using quantum field theory, we get a value that is vastly larger (around 120 orders of magnitude) than the observed value of the cosmological constant. This huge discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the observed value is the essence of the cosmological constant problem.\n\nOver the years, several approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem, including supersymmetry, anthropic principle, and modifications to gravity. However, none of these approaches have provided a fully satisfactory solution to the problem.\n\nIn summary, the cosmological constant problem has evolved from an initial attempt to maintain a static universe to a major challenge in reconciling general relativity with quantum field theory. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the universe's expansion and the role of dark energy, the cosmological constant problem remains an open question in theoretical physics."
