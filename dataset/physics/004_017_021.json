    "message_2": "The deflection angle of light by a gravitational lensing effect is described by the lens equation, which relates the angular positions of the source, the lens, and the image. The lens equation is given by:\n\nβ = θ - (4GM/c^2) * (1/D_LS) * ∫(D_LD_L_LS / D_LS) dθ\n\nwhere:\n- β is the angular position of the source (unlensed)\n- θ is the angular position of the image (lensed)\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- M is the mass of the lensing object (or the mass enclosed within the impact parameter)\n- c is the speed of light\n- D_L is the distance from the observer to the lens\n- D_S is the distance from the observer to the source\n- D_LS is the distance from the lens to the source\n- The integral term represents the weighted average of the mass distribution of the lensing object along the line of sight.\n\nThe deflection angle (α) is given by:\n\nα = (4GM/c^2) * (1/D_LS) * ∫(D_LD_L_LS / D_LS) dθ\n\nThe mass distribution of the lensing object affects the deflection angle through the integral term. If the mass distribution is spherically symmetric, the integral simplifies, and the deflection angle becomes:\n\nα = (4GM/c^2) * (D_LD_S / D_LS)\n\nIn this case, the deflection angle is directly proportional to the mass of the lensing object and inversely proportional to the distances between the observer, lens, and source. For more complex mass distributions, the integral term must be calculated to account for the varying mass density along the line of sight."
