    "message_2": "To calculate the energy generated by the fusion of a 1-gram sample of deuterium and tritium nuclei, we first need to determine the energy released per fusion reaction. The fusion of deuterium (D) and tritium (T) nuclei produces helium (He) and a neutron (n), as shown in the following equation:\n\nD + T → He + n\n\nThe energy released in this reaction is approximately 17.6 MeV (million electron volts) per reaction.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of fusion reactions that can occur in a 1-gram sample. Since the sample is a mixture of deuterium and tritium, we can assume that half of the mass is deuterium and half is tritium. Therefore, we have 0.5 grams of deuterium and 0.5 grams of tritium.\n\nThe molar mass of deuterium is approximately 2 grams/mol, and the molar mass of tritium is approximately 3 grams/mol. Using these values, we can calculate the number of moles of each isotope in the sample:\n\nmoles of deuterium = 0.5 g / 2 g/mol = 0.25 mol\nmoles of tritium = 0.5 g / 3 g/mol = 0.167 mol\n\nSince one deuterium nucleus reacts with one tritium nucleus, the limiting reactant is tritium. Therefore, the number of fusion reactions that can occur is equal to the number of tritium nuclei:\n\nnumber of fusion reactions = 0.167 mol * (6.022 x 10^23 nuclei/mol) ≈ 1.004 x 10^23 reactions\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released by these fusion reactions, taking into account the 50% fusion efficiency:\n\ntotal energy released = (1.004 x 10^23 reactions) * (17.6 MeV/reaction) * (50% efficiency)\n\ntotal energy released ≈ 8.82 x 10^23 MeV\n\nTo convert this energy to joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J:\n\ntotal energy released ≈ 8.82 x 10^23 MeV * (1.602 x 10^-13 J/MeV) ≈ 1.413 x 10^11 J\n\nSo, the energy generated by the fusion of a 1-gram sample of deuterium and tritium nuclei, assuming a 50% fusion efficiency, is approximately 1.413 x 10^11 joules."
