    "message_1": "What is the Zeeman effect produced by the splitting of a spectral line of a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 0.5 T with a wavelength of 656.28 nm (corresponding to the transition from n=3 to n=2) at a distance of 2 cm from the observer's eye? How many spectral lines will be observed?",
    "message_2": "The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of a magnetic field. In this case, we are given a magnetic field of 0.5 T and a wavelength of 656.28 nm, which corresponds to the transition from n=3 to n=2 in a hydrogen atom.\n\nTo determine the splitting of the spectral line, we need to calculate the energy difference between the split levels. This can be done using the formula:\n\nΔE = μB * B * Δm\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, μB is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field (0.5 T), and Δm is the change in the magnetic quantum number (m).\n\nFor the transition from n=3 to n=2, the possible values of Δm are -1, 0, and 1. Therefore, there will be three different energy differences corresponding to these Δm values.\n\nΔE(-1) = μB * B * (-1) = -4.637 x 10^-24 J\nΔE(0) = μB * B * 0 = 0 J\nΔE(1) = μB * B * 1 = 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the corresponding wavelengths for these energy differences using the formula:\n\nΔλ = (h * c) / ΔE\n\nwhere Δλ is the change in wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nΔλ(-1) = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / 4.637 x 10^-24 J = -4.29 x 10^-8 m\nΔλ(0) = 0 m\nΔλ(1) = 4.29 x 10^-8 m\n\nNow we can find the wavelengths of the split spectral lines:\n\nλ1 = 656.28 nm - 4.29 x 10^-8 m = 656.2371 nm\nλ2 = 656.28 nm\nλ3 = 656.28 nm + 4.29 x 10^-8 m = 656.3229 nm\n\nSo, the observer will see three spectral lines with wavelengths 656.2371 nm, 656.28 nm, and 656.3229 nm due to the Zeeman effect."
