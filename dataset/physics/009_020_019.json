    "message_1": "A diffraction grating has 5000 slits per cm. A monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm is incident normally on the grating. What are the angles of the principal maxima in the diffraction pattern?",
    "message_2": "To find the angles of the principal maxima in the diffraction pattern, we can use the grating equation:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the slits, θ is the angle of the principal maxima, m is the order of the maxima, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the slits (d). Since there are 5000 slits per cm, we can calculate d as follows:\n\nd = 1 cm / 5000 slits = 0.0002 cm = 2 * 10^(-4) cm = 2 * 10^(-6) m\n\nNow, we can convert the wavelength of the light from nm to meters:\n\nλ = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNext, we can use the grating equation to find the angles of the principal maxima. We'll do this for different values of m (m = 1, 2, 3, ...). We need to make sure that the sine value does not exceed 1, as it is not possible to have an angle with a sine value greater than 1.\n\nFor m = 1:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * λ) / d = (1 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 10^(-6))\nsin(θ) = 0.3\n\nθ = arcsin(0.3) ≈ 17.46°\n\nFor m = 2:\n\nsin(θ) = (2 * λ) / d = (2 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 10^(-6))\nsin(θ) = 0.6\n\nθ = arcsin(0.6) ≈ 36.87°\n\nFor m = 3:\n\nsin(θ) = (3 * λ) / d = (3 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 10^(-6))\nsin(θ) = 0.9\n\nθ = arcsin(0.9) ≈ 64.16°\n\nFor m = 4:\n\nsin(θ) = (4 * λ) / d = (4 * 600 * 10^(-9)) / (2 * 10^(-6))\nsin(θ) = 1.2\n\nSince sin(θ) > 1, there is no angle for m = 4.\n\nSo, the angles of the principal maxima in the diffraction pattern are approximately 17.46°, 36.87°, and 64.16°."
