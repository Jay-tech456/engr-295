    "message_2": "Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with any of the known forces except gravity. They have been proposed as a candidate for dark matter, which is the invisible mass that makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content. The mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is still uncertain, but it is generally believed to be in the range of keV (kilo-electron volts) to MeV (mega-electron volts).\n\nThere are two main scenarios for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates: warm dark matter (WDM) and cold dark matter (CDM).\n\n1. Warm Dark Matter (WDM): In this scenario, sterile neutrinos have masses in the keV range. These particles would have non-negligible velocities at the time of structure formation, which would lead to a suppression of small-scale structures. This could help resolve some of the discrepancies between the standard cold dark matter model and observations of the distribution of galaxies and other structures in the universe.\n\nOne of the most cited papers on sterile neutrinos as warm dark matter is by Dodelson and Widrow (1994) [1]. They proposed that sterile neutrinos with masses around 1-50 keV could be produced in the early universe through oscillations with active neutrinos. This mass range is consistent with the constraints from X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.\n\n2. Cold Dark Matter (CDM): In this scenario, sterile neutrinos have masses in the MeV range. These particles would be produced in the early universe through interactions with other particles and would behave similarly to the standard cold dark matter particles, like WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).\n\nA study by Boyarsky et al. (2009) [2] suggested that sterile neutrinos with masses in the range of 1-100 MeV could be viable cold dark matter candidates. They showed that such particles could be produced in the early universe through interactions with the Higgs boson and would not be in conflict with existing experimental constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the estimated mass range for sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is between keV to MeV. The exact mass range depends on whether they are considered as warm dark matter or cold dark matter. Further experimental and observational data are needed to narrow down this mass range and confirm or refute the existence of sterile neutrinos.\n\nSources:\n\n[1] Dodelson, S., & Widrow, L. M.
