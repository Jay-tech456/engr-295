    "message_2": "To determine the maximum energy of a cosmic ray that a spacecraft traveling at a speed of 0.8c can withstand before being damaged, we need to consider the relativistic effects on the cosmic ray's energy as observed in the spacecraft's frame of reference. \n\nLet's denote the rest frame energy of the cosmic ray as E₀ and the energy in the spacecraft's frame of reference as E'. The Lorentz factor (γ) is used to relate the energies in the two frames of reference, and it is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the two frames (in this case, the spacecraft's speed) and c is the speed of light. For a spacecraft traveling at 0.8c, the Lorentz factor is:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.64) = 1 / √(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.667\n\nNow, let's consider the energy of the cosmic ray in the spacecraft's frame of reference. Due to the relativistic effects, the energy of the cosmic ray will be higher in the spacecraft's frame than in its rest frame. This is given by:\n\nE' = γ * E₀\n\nTo find the maximum energy of a cosmic ray that the spacecraft can withstand before being damaged, we need to know the threshold energy (E_threshold) in the spacecraft's frame of reference. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem statement. However, if we know the threshold energy, we can find the maximum energy of the cosmic ray in its rest frame (E₀_max) using the following equation:\n\nE₀_max = E_threshold / γ\n\nIn summary, to determine the maximum energy of a cosmic ray that a spacecraft traveling at a speed of 0.8c can withstand before being damaged, we need to know the threshold energy for damage in the spacecraft's frame of reference. Once we have that information, we can use the Lorentz factor and the equations above to find the maximum energy in the cosmic ray's rest frame."
