    "message_2": "To find the phase difference between the two electromagnetic waves, we first need to determine the wavelength of the waves. The frequency (f) is given as 10 GHz, which is equivalent to 10 x 10^9 Hz. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nThe wavelength (λ) can be found using the formula:\n\nc = λf\n\nRearranging for λ, we get:\n\nλ = c / f\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (10 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.03 m\n\nNow, we need to find the phase difference (Δφ) between the two waves. Since they are traveling in opposite directions with a relative speed of 0.6c, we can find the time it takes for one wave to travel the 10-meter distance between them.\n\nRelative speed (v_rel) = 0.6c = 0.6 x (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.8 x 10^8 m/s\n\nTime (t) = distance / relative speed = 10 m / (1.8 x 10^8 m/s) = 5.56 x 10^-8 s\n\nNow, we can find the phase difference using the formula:\n\nΔφ = 2πft\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nΔφ = 2π(10 x 10^9 Hz)(5.56 x 10^-8 s) = 2π(5.56 x 10^2)\n\nΔφ ≈ 2π(556)\n\nThe phase difference between the two electromagnetic waves is approximately 2π(556) radians."
