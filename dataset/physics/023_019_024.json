    "message_1": "Sure, here's the problem: \n\nA quantum computer using Majorana fermions has four gates and a final measurement. The gates are defined as follows: \n\n1. The $i$-th gate ($i=1,2,3$) applies the transformation $U_i = e^{i\\theta_i a_i^\\dagger a_i}$, where $a_i^\\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators of the $i$-th Majorana fermion, respectively. \n\n2. The fourth gate applies the transformation $U_4 = e^{i\\theta_4 a_1 a_2}$. \n\nAssuming that the system starts in the state $|0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$, where $|0\\rangle$ is the vacuum state, what is the probability of measuring the state $|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle$ after the final measurement?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of measuring the state $|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle$ after the final measurement, we first need to apply the transformations to the initial state and then calculate the probability amplitude.\n\nLet's apply the transformations one by one:\n\n1. Applying $U_1$ to the initial state:\n$U_1 |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_1 a_1^\\dagger a_1} |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$, since $a_1|0\\rangle = 0$.\n\n2. Applying $U_2$ to the state:\n$U_2 |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_2 a_2^\\dagger a_2} |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$, since $a_2|0\\rangle = 0$.\n\n3. Applying $U_3$ to the state:\n$U_3 |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_3 a_3^\\dagger a_3} |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$, since $a_3|0\\rangle = 0$.\n\n4. Applying $U_4$ to the state:\n$U_4 |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_4 a_1 a_2} |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle = |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$, since $a_1|0\\rangle = a_2|0\\rangle = 0$.\n\nAfter applying all the transformations, the final state is still $|0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle |0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability amplitude of measuring the state $|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle|1\\rangle$ is 0, and the probability is 0 as well."
