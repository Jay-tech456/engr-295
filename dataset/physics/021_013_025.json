    "message_2": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the remnant radiation from the early universe, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It is a nearly uniform radiation field that fills the entire universe, with a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin. The presence of a black hole can affect the CMB radiation in a few specific ways:\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: A black hole's strong gravitational field can bend the path of light, including the CMB radiation. This bending of light, known as gravitational lensing, can create observable distortions in the CMB radiation. These distortions can be observed as magnification or demagnification of the CMB temperature anisotropies, as well as the creation of multiple images of the same CMB feature.\n\n2. Gravitational redshift: As CMB photons pass through the gravitational field of a black hole, they experience a change in energy due to the gravitational redshift. This effect causes the CMB photons to lose energy and become redshifted, leading to a decrease in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation in the vicinity of the black hole.\n\n3. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect: The SZ effect is a secondary anisotropy in the CMB radiation caused by the interaction of CMB photons with hot electrons in galaxy clusters. In the presence of a black hole, the hot gas surrounding it can cause a similar effect, leading to a distortion in the CMB radiation. This distortion can be observed as a change in the CMB temperature along the line of sight towards the black hole.\n\nTo observe these changes in the CMB radiation due to the presence of a black hole, astronomers can use telescopic observations at microwave and submillimeter wavelengths. High-resolution, high-sensitivity instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) are capable of detecting these subtle changes in the CMB radiation. By analyzing the observed distortions, astronomers can infer the presence of a black hole and study its properties, such as its mass and distance."
