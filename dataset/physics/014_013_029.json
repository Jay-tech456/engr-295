    "message_2": "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles, predominantly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. They constantly bombard the Earth's atmosphere and interact with its components. The composition of cosmic rays can be broadly classified into two categories: primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.\n\nPrimary cosmic rays:\nThese are the original cosmic rays that come from outer space. They are mainly composed of:\n1. Protons (hydrogen nuclei) – about 90%\n2. Alpha particles (helium nuclei) – about 9%\n3. Electrons – less than 1%\n4. Heavier atomic nuclei (such as carbon, oxygen, and iron) – a very small fraction\n\nSecondary cosmic rays:\nWhen primary cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere, they produce secondary cosmic rays. These are mainly composed of:\n1. Muons\n2. Neutrons\n3. Pions\n4. Electrons and positrons\n5. Gamma rays\n6. Neutrinos\n\nCosmic rays are produced through various astrophysical processes, including:\n\n1. Supernova explosions: When a massive star reaches the end of its life, it explodes in a supernova, releasing a tremendous amount of energy and accelerating particles to extremely high speeds. These particles can become cosmic rays.\n\n2. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): The supermassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies can produce powerful jets of energy and matter, which can accelerate particles to cosmic ray energies.\n\n3. Pulsars: These are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. The interaction between the pulsar's magnetic field and its surrounding environment can accelerate particles to cosmic ray energies.\n\n4. Solar flares: Occasionally, the Sun releases bursts of energy in the form of solar flares, which can accelerate particles to cosmic ray energies. However, these solar cosmic rays are generally of lower energy than those from other sources.\n\n5. Cosmic ray acceleration in interstellar space: Interactions between charged particles and magnetic fields in interstellar space can also lead to the acceleration of particles to cosmic ray energies.\n\nIn summary, cosmic rays are composed mainly of protons, alpha particles, and electrons, with a small fraction of heavier atomic nuclei. They are produced through various astrophysical processes, including supernova explosions, active galactic nuclei, pulsars, solar flares, and cosmic ray acceleration in interstellar space."
