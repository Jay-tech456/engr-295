    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from a straight conductor carrying a current of 5 A, we can use the formula derived from Ampere's Law for an infinitely long straight conductor:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field strength (in tesla, T)\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\nI is the current in the conductor (5 A)\nr is the distance from the conductor (0.1 m)\n\nNow, plug in the values and solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 3.14 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field strength at a distance of 10 cm from the straight conductor carrying a current of 5 A is approximately 3.14 × 10^(-5) T."
