    "message_2": "To calculate the activity coefficient (γ) of a 0.5 molal aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law. The Debye-Hückel limiting law is given by:\n\nlog(γ) = -A * z^+ * z^- * √I\n\nwhere:\nγ = activity coefficient\nA = Debye-Hückel parameter (0.5092 for 25°C)\nz^+ = charge of the cation (Na^+ = +1)\nz^- = charge of the anion (Cl^- = -1)\nI = ionic strength of the solution\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the ionic strength (I) of the solution. The ionic strength is given by:\n\nI = 0.5 * Σ(ci * z^2)\n\nwhere:\nci = concentration of ion i (in molality)\nz = charge of ion i\n\nFor a 0.5 molal NaCl solution, the concentration of Na^+ and Cl^- ions are both 0.5 mol/kg. Therefore, the ionic strength (I) can be calculated as:\n\nI = 0.5 * [(0.5 * (+1)^2) + (0.5 * (-1)^2)]\nI = 0.5 * (0.5 + 0.5)\nI = 0.5\n\nNow, we can use the Debye-Hückel limiting law to calculate the activity coefficient (γ):\n\nlog(γ) = -A * z^+ * z^- * √I\nlog(γ) = -0.5092 * (+1) * (-1) * √0.5\nlog(γ) = 0.5092 * √0.5\n\nNow, we can find the activity coefficient (γ) by taking the antilog:\n\nγ = 10^(0.5092 * √0.5)\nγ ≈ 1.349\n\nSo, the activity coefficient of a 0.5 molal aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) at 25°C is approximately 1.349."
