    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the angle between the polarizers of two polarizing filters that allow only 25% of light to pass through them when they are crossed at a certain angle. If one of the filters is rotated by 30 degrees from the crossed position, how much light will pass through the two filters? Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light passing through two polarizing filters is given by:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I is the transmitted intensity, I₀ is the initial intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nWe are given that 25% of light passes through the filters when they are crossed at a certain angle. Therefore, we can write:\n\n0.25 * I₀ = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nDividing both sides by I₀, we get:\n\n0.25 = cos²(θ)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\ncos(θ) = ±0.5\n\nSince we are only interested in the angle between 0 and 90 degrees, we can ignore the negative value:\n\ncos(θ) = 0.5\n\nθ = cos^(-1)(0.5) = 60 degrees\n\nNow, we are asked to find the transmitted intensity when one of the filters is rotated by 30 degrees from the crossed position. This means the new angle between the filters is:\n\nθ' = θ - 30 = 60 - 30 = 30 degrees\n\nUsing Malus' Law again, we can find the transmitted intensity with the new angle:\n\nI' = I₀ * cos²(θ')\n\nI' = I₀ * cos²(30)\n\nSince cos(30) = √3/2, we have:\n\nI' = I₀ * ( (√3/2)² )\n\nI' = I₀ * (3/4)\n\nSo, the fraction of light that passes through the two filters when one of them is rotated by 30 degrees from the crossed position is 3/4 or 75%."
