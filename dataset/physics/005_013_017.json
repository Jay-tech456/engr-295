    "message_1": "A particle with a rest mass of 1 kg is traveling with a velocity of 0.6c. It collides head-on with another particle with the same rest mass, which is at rest. What is the total energy of the system after the collision?",
    "message_2": "To find the total energy of the system after the collision, we first need to determine the energy of each particle before the collision. We can use the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the moving particle (particle 1), we first need to find its relativistic mass (m1') using the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. For particle 1, v = 0.6c:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow, we can find the relativistic mass (m1'):\n\nm1' = m1 * γ = 1 kg * 1.25 = 1.25 kg\n\nNext, we find the momentum (p1) of particle 1:\n\np1 = m1' * v = 1.25 kg * 0.6c\n\nNow, we can find the energy (E1) of particle 1 using the energy-momentum equation:\n\nE1^2 = (m1'c^2)^2 + (p1c)^2\nE1 = sqrt((1.25 kg * c^2)^2 + (1.25 kg * 0.6c * c)^2)\nE1 ≈ 1.95 * 10^17 J\n\nFor the particle at rest (particle 2), its energy (E2) is simply its rest mass energy:\n\nE2 = m2 * c^2 = 1 kg * c^2 ≈ 9 * 10^16 J\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of the system before the collision:\n\nE_total_before = E1 + E2 ≈ 1.95 * 10^17 J + 9 * 10^16 J ≈ 2.85 * 10^17 J\n\nSince the collision is head-on, and assuming it is an inelastic collision (particles stick together), the total energy of the system after the collision should be conserved:\n\nE_total_after = E_total_before ≈ 2.85 * 10^17 J"
