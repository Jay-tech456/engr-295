    "message_1": "A particle is moving at a velocity of 0.8c relative to an observer. What is the energy of the particle in terms of its rest mass energy? How much energy must be supplied to the particle in order to increase its velocity to 0.9c? How does this increase in velocity affect the energy of the particle?",
    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle in terms of its rest mass energy, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum equation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nwhere E is the total energy of the particle, m is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFor the initial velocity of 0.8c:\n\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(0.36)\nE1 = mc^2 / 0.6\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the particle when its velocity is increased to 0.9c:\n\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(0.19)\nE2 = mc^2 / 0.43589 (approximately)\n\nTo find the amount of energy that must be supplied to the particle to increase its velocity from 0.8c to 0.9c, we can find the difference between the initial and final energies:\n\nΔE = E2 - E1\nΔE = mc^2/0.43589 - mc^2/0.6\nΔE = mc^2 (1/0.43589 - 1/0.6)\nΔE ≈ mc^2 (2.293 - 1.667)\nΔE ≈ 0.626 mc^2\n\nSo, approximately 0.626 times the rest mass energy must be supplied to the particle to increase its velocity from 0.8c to 0.9c.\n\nThe increase in velocity from 0.8c to 0.9c affects the energy of the particle by increasing its total energy. As the velocity of the particle increases, its relativistic mass increases, and so does its total energy. In this case, the total energy of the particle increases from E1 = mc^2/0.6 to E2 = mc^2/0.43589 (approximately)."
