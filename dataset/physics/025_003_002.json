    "message_2": "To calculate the electric potential difference required to open a voltage-gated sodium ion channel in a neuron, we need to find the difference between the threshold potential and the resting membrane potential.\n\nThreshold potential: -55 mV\nResting membrane potential: -70 mV\n\nElectric potential difference = Threshold potential - Resting membrane potential\nElectric potential difference = (-55 mV) - (-70 mV)\n\nElectric potential difference = 15 mV\n\nSo, the electric potential difference required to open a voltage-gated sodium ion channel in a neuron is 15 mV."
