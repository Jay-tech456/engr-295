    "message_1": "A straight, cylindrical wire of radius R = 2 cm and length L = 30 cm carries a steady current of 5 A. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point P located at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the cylinder, on its axial line.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a straight, cylindrical wire, the magnetic field is symmetrical around the wire, so we can consider a circular loop with radius r (8 cm in this case) centered on the wire's axis. The magnetic field at any point on this loop is tangent to the loop, and the differential length element dl is also tangent to the loop. Thus, B⋅dl = B dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for this situation:\n\n∮B dl = B∮dl = B(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nWe need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the loop is outside the wire (r > R), the entire current of the wire is enclosed by the loop. Therefore, I = 5 A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 5 A) / (2π × 0.08 m)\nB ≈ (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.16π m)\nB ≈ 1 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 1 × 10^(-5) T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field at point P will be in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the top of the wire."
