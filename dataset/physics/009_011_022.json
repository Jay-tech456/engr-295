    "message_1": "A student is asked to design a plano-convex lens with a focal length of 50 cm and an index of refraction of 1.5. The diameter of the lens must be 10 cm. Using the Lensmakerâ€™s equation, calculate the necessary curvature of each surface of the lens to meet these design specifications.",
    "message_2": "The Lensmaker's equation is given by:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2),\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the index of refraction, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface (convex side), and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface (flat side).\n\nFor a plano-convex lens, the second surface is flat, which means R2 approaches infinity. Therefore, the Lensmaker's equation simplifies to:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1).\n\nWe are given the focal length (f = 50 cm), the index of refraction (n = 1.5), and we need to find the radius of curvature R1.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n1/50 = (1.5 - 1) * (1/R1).\n\nSolving for R1:\n\n1/50 = 0.5 * (1/R1)\n1/0.5 = R1/50\n2 = R1/50\n\nR1 = 100 cm.\n\nSo, the necessary curvature of the convex surface (R1) is 100 cm. The flat surface (R2) has no curvature, so its radius of curvature is infinity."
