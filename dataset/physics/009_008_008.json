    "message_2": "To draw a ray diagram and determine the magnification and position of the image, we need to use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: M = -v/u\n\nHere, f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the focal length (f) of the concave mirror. The radius of curvature (R) is given as 20 cm. For a concave mirror, the focal length is half the radius of curvature.\n\nf = R/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The object distance (u) is given as -15 cm (negative because it's a real object).\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/(-15) + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(-15 + 10v) / (10 * -15 * v) = 1/v + 1/(-15)\n(-15 + 10v) / (10 * -15 * v) = (v - 15) / (-15 * v)\n\nNow we can cross-multiply and solve for v:\n\n-15 + 10v = 10v - 150\n150 - 15 = 10v - 10v\nv = 135 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is 135 cm, and it's positive, meaning the image is real and formed on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\nM = -135 / -15\nM = 9\n\nThe magnification is 9, meaning the image is 9 times larger than the object.\n\nRay diagram:\n1. Draw a concave mirror with the center of curvature (C) and the focal point (F) marked.\n2. Draw the object (AB) perpendicular to the principal axis.\n3. Draw a ray parallel to the principal axis from the top of the object (A) to the mirror. This ray will reflect through the focal point (F).\n4. Draw another ray from the top of the object (A) through the center of curvature (C). This ray will reflect back along the same path.\n5. The intersection of the reflected rays will give the position of the image (A'B').\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed 135 cm from the mirror, it is real, inverted, and 9 times larger than the object."
