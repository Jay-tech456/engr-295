    "message_1": "A physics student is asked to determine the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature. The student knows the boiling point and enthalpy of vaporization of the substance. Write a problem for the student to solve, given the following information: \n\nThe boiling point of the liquid is 75 °C, and its enthalpy of vaporization is 40 kJ/mol. At a temperature of 60 °C, the vapor pressure of the substance is 68.3 kPa. What is the vapor pressure of the substance at its boiling point of 75 °C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, the student can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance at two different temperatures to its enthalpy of vaporization:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nGiven information:\nBoiling point (T2) = 75 °C = 348.15 K\nEnthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) = 40 kJ/mol = 40,000 J/mol\nTemperature at which vapor pressure is known (T1) = 60 °C = 333.15 K\nVapor pressure at T1 (P1) = 68.3 kPa\n\nThe student needs to find the vapor pressure at the boiling point (P2).\n\nFirst, the student should convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\nT1 = 60 °C + 273.15 = 333.15 K\nT2 = 75 °C + 273.15 = 348.15 K\n\nNext, the student should plug the given values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/68.3) = -40,000/8.314 * (1/348.15 - 1/333.15)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 68.3 * exp(-40,000/8.314 * (1/348.15 - 1/333.15))\nP2 ≈ 101.3 kPa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of the substance at its boiling point of 75 °C is approximately 101.3 kPa."
