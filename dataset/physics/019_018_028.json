    "message_2": "In a free quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) of two scalar fields $\\phi(x_1)$ and $\\phi(x_2)$ can be calculated using the propagator, which is the two-point correlation function of the fields. For a free scalar field theory, the propagator is given by:\n\n$$\n\\langle 0 | \\phi(x_1) \\phi(x_2) | 0 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\frac{1}{|x_1 - x_2|^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $|x_1 - x_2|$ is the Euclidean distance between the two points $x_1$ and $x_2$. The OPE is an expansion of the product of the two fields in terms of local operators at a single point, say $x_2$. In the limit $|x_1 - x_2| \\to 0$, the leading term in the OPE is simply the propagator itself:\n\n$$\n\\phi(x_1) \\phi(x_2) \\sim \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\frac{1}{|x_1 - x_2|^2}\n$$\n\nIn a free theory, there are no higher-order terms in the OPE involving other local operators, since the fields are non-interacting. Therefore, the leading term in the OPE for the free scalar field theory is just the propagator."
