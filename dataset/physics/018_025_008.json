    "message_2": "The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was a significant milestone in the field of particle physics. The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle responsible for providing other particles with mass through the Higgs field. Measuring the mass of the Higgs boson is crucial for understanding the properties of the Higgs field and the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nThe primary techniques used in measuring the mass of the Higgs boson involve analyzing the decay products of the Higgs boson after it is produced in high-energy particle collisions at the LHC. The two main experiments at the LHC, ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), have been instrumental in measuring the Higgs boson mass.\n\n1. Decay channels: The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Physicists study various decay channels, such as the Higgs boson decaying into two photons (γγ), two Z bosons (ZZ), or two W bosons (WW). By analyzing the energies and momenta of these decay products, the mass of the Higgs boson can be reconstructed.\n\n2. Invariant mass: The invariant mass is a quantity calculated from the energies and momenta of the decay products. It is conserved in the decay process and is equal to the mass of the parent particle (in this case, the Higgs boson). By analyzing the invariant mass distribution of the decay products, physicists can determine the mass of the Higgs boson.\n\n3. Statistical analysis: Due to the large number of background events and the rarity of Higgs boson production, sophisticated statistical methods are employed to extract the Higgs boson signal from the data. Techniques such as maximum likelihood fits and profile likelihood ratios are used to estimate the mass and its uncertainty.\n\nThe precision achieved in the measurements of the Higgs boson mass has improved over time as more data has been collected and analyzed. The current combined measurement from the ATLAS and CMS experiments is approximately 125.1 GeV/c² with an uncertainty of around 0.2 GeV/c². This level of precision is crucial for testing the predictions of the Standard Model and searching for potential new physics beyond the Standard Model."
