    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The equation for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere Δt' is the time interval experienced by the moving observer (the spaceship clock), Δt is the time interval experienced by the stationary observer (the Earth clock), v is the relative velocity of the moving observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the spaceship is traveling at a speed of 0.8c relative to Earth, and the time interval experienced by the Earth clock is 5 years.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given values into the equation:\n\nΔt' = 5 years / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nΔt' = 5 years / √(1 - 0.64)\n\nΔt' = 5 years / √(0.36)\n\nNow, calculate the square root of 0.36:\n\n√(0.36) = 0.6\n\nFinally, divide the time interval experienced by the Earth clock by the result:\n\nΔt' = 5 years / 0.6 ≈ 8.33 years\n\nSo, approximately 8.33 years would have passed on the spaceship clock while 5 years passed on the Earth clock."
