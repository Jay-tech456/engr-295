    "message_2": "To find the temperature of the universe when it was 380,000 years old, we can use the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation spectrum. The CMB radiation is a relic of the early universe and is a nearly perfect blackbody radiation. Therefore, we can use Planck's law and Wien's displacement law to determine the temperature.\n\nPlanck's law describes the spectral radiance of a blackbody at a given temperature T:\n\nB(λ, T) = (2πhc^2/λ^5) * (1/(e^(hc/(λk_BT)) - 1))\n\nwhere B(λ, T) is the spectral radiance, λ is the wavelength, T is the temperature, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10^-23 J/K).\n\nWien's displacement law relates the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the blackbody radiation to its temperature:\n\nλ_max * T = b\n\nwhere b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 mK).\n\nThe CMB radiation has a peak wavelength of approximately 1.063 mm (1.063 x 10^-3 m). Using Wien's displacement law, we can find the temperature:\n\nT = b / λ_max\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 mK) / (1.063 x 10^-3 m)\nT ≈ 2.73 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the universe when it was 380,000 years old, as inferred from the cosmic microwave background radiation spectrum, is approximately 2.73 Kelvin."
