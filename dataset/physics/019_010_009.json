    "message_2": "Calculating the 3-loop beta function for the strong coupling constant in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using the method of dimensional regularization is a highly complex task that requires advanced knowledge of quantum field theory and specialized techniques. Here, we will outline the general procedure and main steps involved in the calculation.\n\n1. Start with the QCD Lagrangian density, which describes the interaction between quarks and gluons. In natural units, it is given by:\n\nL = -1/4 * G^a_{μν} * G^{aμν} + ∑_i ψ̄_i (i * γ^μ * D_μ - m_i) ψ_i\n\nwhere G^a_{μν} is the gluon field strength tensor, ψ_i is the quark field, D_μ is the covariant derivative, m_i is the quark mass, and the sum runs over all quark flavors.\n\n2. Introduce the renormalization scale μ and the strong coupling constant α_s(μ), which is related to the bare coupling constant g by:\n\nα_s(μ) = g^2 / (4π)\n\n3. Use dimensional regularization to regularize the ultraviolet divergences that appear in the loop calculations. In this method, the space-time dimension d is analytically continued to d = 4 - 2ε, where ε is a small parameter.\n\n4. Calculate the renormalization group equation (RGE) for the strong coupling constant α_s(μ). The RGE relates the change in the coupling constant with respect to the renormalization scale μ:\n\ndα_s(μ) / d ln(μ) = β(α_s)\n\nwhere β(α_s) is the beta function, which depends on the coupling constant α_s.\n\n5. Compute the 1-loop, 2-loop, and 3-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the beta function. This involves calculating the diagrams with one, two, and three gluon loops, as well as diagrams with quark loops and mixed quark-gluon loops.\n\n6. For each diagram, compute the amplitude using Feynman rules and techniques such as the Slavnov-Taylor identities and the background field method. These calculations involve integrals over loop momenta, which can be highly non-trivial.\n\n7. Extract the divergent parts of the amplitudes and renormalize them using the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme or its modified version, the MS-bar (¯¯¯¯¯¯MS) scheme. This involves subtracting the poles in ε from the amplitudes.\n\n8. Combine the renormalized amplitudes to obtain the 3-loop beta function:\n\nβ(α_s) = β_0 * α_s^2 + β_1 * α_s^3 + β_2 * α_s^4 + O(α_s^5)\n\nwhere β_0, β_1, and β_2 are the 1-loop, 2-loop, and 3-loop coefficients, respectively.\n\n9. The coefficients β_0, β_1, and β_2 are given by:\n\nβ_0 = (11 * C_A - 2 * n_f) / (12 * π)\nβ_1 = (17 * C_A^2 - 5 * C_A * n_f - 3 * C_F * n_f) / (24 * π^2)\nβ_2 = (2857 * C_A^3 - 1415 * C_A^2 * n_f - 205 * C_A * C_F * n_f + 324 * C_F^2 * n_f) / (3456 * π^3)\n\nwhere C_A = N_c (the number of colors, usually N_c = 3 for QCD), C_F = (N_c^2 - 1) / (2 * N_c), and n_f is the number of active quark flavors.\n\n10. The 3-loop beta function can now be used to study the running of the strong coupling constant α_s(μ) and its dependence on the renormalization scale μ, as well as to make predictions for high-energy processes in QCD.\n\nPlease note that this is a highly simplified outline of the procedure, and the actual calculation requires a deep understanding of quantum field theory, renormalization techniques, and specialized mathematical tools."
