    "message_2": "To calculate the decay rate of a pi meson (π0) to two photons (γ) in quantum field theory, we need to consider the Feynman diagram for this process. The π0 meson decays into two photons through the triangle anomaly, which involves three charged pions (π±) in the loop.\n\nFirst, let's denote the mass of the pi meson as mπ and the fine-structure constant as α. The decay rate (Γ) of the π0 meson can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΓ(π0 → γγ) = (α^2 * mπ^3) / (64 * π^3 * fπ^2)\n\nHere, fπ is the pion decay constant, which is approximately 92 MeV.\n\nGiven the mass of the pi meson (mπ) and the fine-structure constant (α), we can plug these values into the formula to calculate the decay rate (Γ).\n\nFor example, let's use the following values:\n- mπ = 135 MeV (mass of the neutral pion)\n- α = 1/137 (fine-structure constant)\n\nΓ(π0 → γγ) = (α^2 * mπ^3) / (64 * π^3 * fπ^2)\nΓ(π0 → γγ) = ((1/137)^2 * (135 MeV)^3) / (64 * π^3 * (92 MeV)^2)\n\nAfter plugging in these values and calculating the result, we get:\n\nΓ(π0 → γγ) ≈ 7.7 eV\n\nSo, the decay rate of a pi meson to two photons in quantum field theory is approximately 7.7 eV."
