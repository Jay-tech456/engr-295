    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the beta function describes the running of the coupling constant with the energy scale. The phi^4 theory is a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction term. The Lagrangian density for the phi^4 theory is given by:\n\nL = (1/2)(∂_μ φ)(∂^μ φ) - (1/2)m^2 φ^2 - (λ/4!)φ^4\n\nHere, φ is the scalar field, m is the mass, and λ is the coupling constant.\n\nTo calculate the beta function, we need to compute the one-loop correction to the coupling constant λ. This involves calculating the 4-point function at one-loop level. The relevant Feynman diagram for this process is the \"tadpole\" diagram, where a single loop connects two vertices.\n\nThe amplitude for this diagram is proportional to:\n\nA ∝ λ^2 ∫ d^4k / (2π)^4 * 1/(k^2 - m^2 + iε)\n\nTo extract the beta function, we need to focus on the divergent part of this integral. Using dimensional regularization in d = 4 - 2ε dimensions, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nA ∝ λ^2 * m^(4-d) * Γ(1 - d/2) / (4π)^(d/2)\n\nNow, we can expand the amplitude in powers of ε:\n\nA ∝ λ^2 * (1/16π^2) * (1/ε - γ + log(4π) - log(m^2))\n\nThe divergent part of the amplitude is proportional to 1/ε, and the beta function is related to the coefficient of this term:\n\nβ(λ) = dλ/d(log μ) = -λ^2 * (1/16π^2)\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the coupling constant decreases as the energy scale (μ) increases. Therefore, the phi^4 theory is not asymptotically free, as the coupling constant does not vanish at high energies."
