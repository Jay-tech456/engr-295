    "message_2": "The frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the final stages of a binary black hole merger depend on several factors, including the masses of the black holes, their spins, and their orientation relative to the observer. In this case, we are given a total mass of 30 solar masses for the binary system.\n\nFirst, let's consider the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. In the final stages of a binary black hole merger, the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves is approximately given by the orbital frequency of the binary system. This can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3) / (G * M * π * 8)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the total mass of the binary system. Plugging in the values:\n\nf ≈ (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 30 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg * π * 8)\n\nf ≈ 1.97 x 10^2 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency of the emitted gravitational waves is approximately 197 Hz.\n\nNow let's consider the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves. The amplitude depends on several factors, including the masses of the black holes, their spins, and their orientation relative to the observer. In general, the amplitude is larger for more massive black holes and for systems with higher spins. The amplitude also depends on the distance to the binary system, with the amplitude decreasing as the distance increases.\n\nThe amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * η) / (c^2 * R)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, η is the symmetric mass ratio (equal to the product of the individual black hole masses divided by the square of the total mass), and R is the distance to the binary system. The spins and orientation of the black holes will affect the value of η, and thus the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves.\n\nWithout specific information about the spins and orientation of the black holes, we cannot provide an exact value for the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves. However, we can say that the amplitude will be larger for systems with higher spins and for systems that are more face-on relative to the observer."
