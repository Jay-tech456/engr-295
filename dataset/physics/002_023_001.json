    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of ethanol at 50°C, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the standard enthalpy of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the following information:\nΔHvap = 38.6 kJ/mol = 38600 J/mol\nNormal boiling point (T1) = 78.4°C = 351.55 K (converting to Kelvin by adding 273.15)\nP1 = 1 atm (vapor pressure at the normal boiling point)\nT2 = 50°C = 323.15 K (converting to Kelvin by adding 273.15)\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K) (ideal gas constant)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/1) = -(38600 J/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol*K)) * (1/323.15 K - 1/351.55 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nln(P2) = -38600 / 8.314 * (0.003096 - 0.002842)\nln(P2) = -38600 / 8.314 * 0.000254\nln(P2) = -11.83\n\nNow, we can find P2 by taking the exponent of both sides:\n\nP2 = e^(-11.83)\nP2 ≈ 7.07 * 10^(-6) atm\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of ethanol at 50°C is approximately 7.07 * 10^(-6) atm."
