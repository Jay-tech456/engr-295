    "message_2": "In the Rutherford scattering experiment, alpha particles are scattered by atomic nuclei, and the relationship between the scattering angle (θ) and the impact parameter (b) can be derived from the principles of classical mechanics and electrostatics. The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance between the initial trajectory of the alpha particle and the center of the nucleus.\n\nThe relationship between the scattering angle and the impact parameter can be expressed as:\n\nb = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e²) / (4 * π * ε₀ * K * cot(θ/2))\n\nwhere Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the alpha particle and the target nucleus, e is the elementary charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, K is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle, and cot(θ/2) is the cotangent of half the scattering angle.\n\nTo determine the size of atomic nuclei using this relationship, one can perform the Rutherford scattering experiment and measure the scattering angles of the alpha particles. By analyzing the distribution of scattering angles, one can deduce the impact parameter and, consequently, the size of the nucleus.\n\nWhen the scattering angle is large (i.e., the alpha particle is deflected significantly), it means that the alpha particle has approached the nucleus closely, and the impact parameter is small. By finding the minimum impact parameter (b_min) corresponding to the largest scattering angle, one can estimate the size of the atomic nucleus. The size of the nucleus is approximately equal to the minimum impact parameter, as the alpha particle cannot penetrate the nucleus and is scattered at a large angle when it comes very close to it.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the scattering angle and the impact parameter in the Rutherford scattering experiment can be used to determine the size of atomic nuclei by analyzing the distribution of scattering angles and finding the minimum impact parameter."
