    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small segment of wire (dl) carrying current (I) at a point (P) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the length of the small segment of wire, r is the position vector from the wire segment to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the square loop has four equal sides, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by one side and then multiply it by 4 to get the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one side of the square loop. We can divide the side into small segments (dl) and calculate the magnetic field produced by each segment at the center of the square. Due to symmetry, the magnetic field produced by each segment will have the same magnitude, and their directions will add up constructively.\n\nLet's consider a small segment (dl) at a distance x from the center of the side. The position vector (r) from the segment to the center of the square will have a magnitude:\n\nr = sqrt((0.1/2)^2 + x^2)\n\nThe angle (θ) between the position vector (r) and the current (I) is 90 degrees, so the cross product (dl × r) will have a magnitude:\n\ndl × r = dl * r * sin(θ) = dl * r\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by this small segment (dB) at the center:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire side (from x = -0.1/2 to x = 0.1/2) will give us the magnetic field produced by one side:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl * r) / (4 * π * r^3) dx from -0.1/2 to 0.1/2\n\nSince the square loop has four equal sides, the total magnetic field at the center will be:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a mathematical software or calculator. The result is:\n\nB_total ≈ 1.6 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 1.6 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
