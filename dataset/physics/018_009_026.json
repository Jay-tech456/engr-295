    "message_2": "The relationship between the entropy of a black hole and the area of its event horizon is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. This formula is derived from the laws of black hole thermodynamics, which are analogous to the laws of classical thermodynamics.\n\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is given by:\n\nS = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\nwhere:\n- S is the entropy of the black hole\n- A is the area of the event horizon\n- k is the Boltzmann constant\n- c is the speed of light\n- G is the gravitational constant\n- hbar is the reduced Planck constant\n\nThis formula states that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The proportionality constant is determined by fundamental constants of nature, such as the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and the Planck constant. This relationship between entropy and event horizon area is a key result in black hole thermodynamics and has deep implications for our understanding of gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of information in the universe."
