Given that the lighthouse beacon has an intensity of 80 cd (candela) and the minimum detectable intensity of the human eye is about 2.5x10^-4 cd/m2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the intensity of light:\n\nI = P / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nWhere I is the intensity of light (in candela per square meter, cd/m^2), P is the power of the light source (in candela, cd), and r is the distance from the light source (in meters, m).\n\nWe are given the power of the lighthouse beacon (P = 80 cd) and the minimum detectable intensity of the human eye (I = 2.5x10^-4 cd/m^2). We need to find the maximum distance r at which a person with normal vision can see the lighthouse beacon.\n\nFirst, we will rearrange the formula to solve for r:\n\nr^2 = P / (4 * π * I)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nr^2 = 80 cd / (4 * π * 2.5x10^-4 cd/m^2)\n\nr^2 ≈ 80 / (4 * π * 2.5x10^-4)\n\nr^2 ≈ 25594.8\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find r:\n\nr ≈ √25594.8\n\nr ≈ 160 m\n\nSo, the maximum distance at which a person with normal vision can see the lighthouse beacon emitting green light at a wavelength of 520 nm is approximately 160 meters."
