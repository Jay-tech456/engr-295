    "message_2": "In a 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), the scaling dimensions of primary operators are determined by their conformal weights. The conformal weights (h, ħ) are eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators L_0 and L̄_0, which generate scale transformations and rotations.\n\nThe scaling dimension Δ of a primary operator is given by the sum of its conformal weights:\n\nΔ = h + ħ\n\nThe correlation functions of primary operators in a CFT are determined by the conformal symmetry. For a set of primary operators O_i with scaling dimensions Δ_i, the two-point correlation function is given by:\n\n< O_i(x) O_j(y) > = δ_ij / |x - y|^(Δ_i + Δ_j)\n\nwhere δ_ij is the Kronecker delta, and x and y are the spacetime coordinates of the operators.\n\nFor the three-point correlation function, we have:\n\n< O_i(x_1) O_j(x_2) O_k(x_3) > = C_ijk * |x_12|^(Δ_1 + Δ_2 - Δ_3) * |x_13|^(Δ_1 + Δ_3 - Δ_2) * |x_23|^(Δ_2 + Δ_3 - Δ_1)\n\nwhere C_ijk are the structure constants of the CFT, and x_ij = x_i - x_j.\n\nHigher-point correlation functions can be computed using the operator product expansion (OPE) and conformal symmetry. The OPE expresses the product of two primary operators as a sum of other primary operators with coefficients that depend on the spacetime coordinates:\n\nO_i(x) O_j(y) = Σ_k C_ijk (x - y)^(-Δ_i - Δ_j + Δ_k) O_k(y)\n\nBy using the OPE and conformal symmetry, one can compute higher-point correlation functions in terms of lower-point correlation functions and the structure constants C_ijk."
