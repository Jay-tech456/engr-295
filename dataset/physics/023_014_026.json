    "message_2": "In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment, the nuclear spin of an atom can be manipulated using radiofrequency pulses. When a 90-degree pulse is applied, the spin is rotated from the z-axis to the x-y plane. To calculate the probability of measuring the nuclear spin to be \"up\" (along the z-axis) after the 90-degree pulse, we can use the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe initial state of the nuclear spin along the z-axis can be represented by the spin-up state |ψ⟩ = |+z⟩. After applying the 90-degree pulse, the spin state is rotated to the x-y plane, which can be represented as a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states:\n\n|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2)|+z⟩ + (1/√2)|-z⟩\n\nNow, we want to calculate the probability of measuring the spin to be \"up\" (along the z-axis) after the pulse. The probability is given by the square of the amplitude of the spin-up state in the new superposition:\n\nP(+z) = |⟨+z|ψ'⟩|^2\n\nTo calculate this, we take the inner product of the spin-up state with the new superposition:\n\n⟨+z|ψ'⟩ = ⟨+z|(1/√2)|+z⟩ + ⟨+z|(1/√2)|-z⟩\n\nSince ⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1 and ⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0, we have:\n\n⟨+z|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2)\n\nNow, we square this amplitude to find the probability:\n\nP(+z) = |(1/√2)|^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the nuclear spin to be \"up\" after applying a 90-degree radiofrequency pulse is 1/2 or 50%."
