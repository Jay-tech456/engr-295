    "message_2": "To calculate the change in internal energy of the block, we first need to find the amount of heat absorbed by the block. We can do this using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the block, c is the specific heat capacity of aluminum, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nm = 2 kg = 2000 g (since 1 kg = 1000 g)\nc = 0.9 J/g°C\nInitial temperature (T1) = 25°C\nFinal temperature (T2) = 100°C\n\nΔT = T2 - T1 = 100°C - 25°C = 75°C\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (2000 g)(0.9 J/g°C)(75°C)\n\nQ = 135000 J\n\nSince the block absorbs all the heat transferred to it, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat absorbed:\n\nΔU = Q = 135000 J\n\nSo, the change in internal energy of the block is 135,000 Joules."
