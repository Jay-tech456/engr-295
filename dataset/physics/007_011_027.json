    "message_2": "To determine the expected final mass of a star that begins its life with 15 solar masses and undergoes a supernova explosion, we need to consider the mass loss that occurs during the star's lifetime and the mass ejected during the supernova explosion.\n\nDuring its lifetime, a massive star like this will lose a significant amount of mass through stellar winds. The mass loss rate depends on the initial mass of the star and its metallicity. For a star with 15 solar masses, we can estimate that it will lose about 3-5 solar masses due to stellar winds before the supernova explosion.\n\nNow, let's consider the supernova explosion. When a massive star undergoes a supernova, its core collapses, and a significant amount of mass is ejected into space. The amount of mass ejected depends on the energy of the explosion and the binding energy of the star's outer layers. For a star with an initial mass of 15 solar masses, we can estimate that the supernova explosion will eject about 5-7 solar masses.\n\nTaking into account both mass loss due to stellar winds and mass ejected during the supernova explosion, the star will lose approximately 8-12 solar masses. Therefore, the expected final mass of the neutron star or black hole left behind after the explosion will be:\n\n15 solar masses (initial mass) - 8 to 12 solar masses (mass loss) = 3 to 7 solar masses\n\nThe final mass of the compact object will depend on the specific details of the star's evolution and the supernova explosion. If the mass of the remnant is below about 3 solar masses, it will likely form a neutron star. If the mass is above this threshold, it will likely collapse into a black hole. In this case, the expected final mass of the neutron star or black hole left behind after the explosion is between 3 and 7 solar masses."
