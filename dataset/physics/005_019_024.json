Another train is stationary and in line with the first train and the radio tower. What is the frequency of the radio signal received by the second train, as perceived by an observer on the first train? And how does this compare to the frequency of the signal as heard by an observer on the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf' = f * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))\n\nwhere f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, and β is the ratio of the relative velocity between the source and the observer to the speed of light (v/c).\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency of the radio signal received by the second (stationary) train as perceived by an observer on the ground. Since the second train is stationary, β = 0, and the observed frequency is the same as the source frequency:\n\nf' = f = 90 MHz\n\nNow, let's find the frequency of the radio signal received by the second train as perceived by an observer on the first train. In this case, the first train is moving towards the radio tower with a velocity of 0.6c, so β = 0.6. Using the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\nf' = 90 MHz * sqrt((1 + 0.6) / (1 - 0.6))\nf' = 90 MHz * sqrt(1.6 / 0.4)\nf' = 90 MHz * sqrt(4)\nf' = 90 MHz * 2\nf' = 180 MHz\n\nSo, the frequency of the radio signal received by the second train, as perceived by an observer on the first train, is 180 MHz. This is twice the frequency of the signal as heard by an observer on the ground (90 MHz)."
