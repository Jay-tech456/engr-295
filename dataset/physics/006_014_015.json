    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state (n=2) in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the spontaneous emission rate (A21), which is the probability per unit time that an electron in the excited state will decay to the ground state by emitting a photon.\n\nA21 = (64π^4 e^2)/(3h λ^3 c) * |ψ2(r)|^2\n\nwhere:\nA21 = spontaneous emission rate (s^-1)\ne = elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C)\nh = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 Js)\nλ = wavelength of the emitted photon (121.6 nm)\nc = speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s)\nψ2(r) = radial wave function of the excited state (n=2)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength to meters:\n\nλ = 121.6 nm × (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 121.6 × 10^-9 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the spontaneous emission rate (A21):\n\nA21 = (64π^4 (1.6 × 10^-19 C)^2) / (3(6.626 × 10^-34 Js) (121.6 × 10^-9 m)^3 (3 × 10^8 m/s)) * |ψ2(r)|^2\n\nSince we are only interested in the lifetime of the first excited state, we can ignore the |ψ2(r)|^2 term, as it is a constant for the hydrogen atom. The lifetime (τ) of the excited state is the inverse of the spontaneous emission rate:\n\nτ = 1 / A21\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nτ = 1 / ((64π^4 (1.6 × 10^-19 C)^2) / (3(6.626 × 10^-34 Js) (121.6 × 10^-9 m)^3 (3 × 10^8 m/s)))\n\nτ ≈ 2.05 × 10^-9 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state (n=2) in a hydrogen atom is approximately 2.05 × 10^-9 seconds."
