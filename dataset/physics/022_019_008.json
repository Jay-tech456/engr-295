    "message_2": "Gravitinos are hypothetical particles predicted by supersymmetry, a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. They are the superpartners of gravitons, the particles that mediate the gravitational force. If gravitinos exist and are stable, they could be a viable candidate for dark matter.\n\nThe theoretical mass range for gravitinos is quite broad, spanning from sub-electronvolt (sub-eV) to several TeV (tera-electronvolt) scales. The actual mass depends on the specific supersymmetric model and the parameters involved. In general, gravitinos with masses below 1 keV (kilo-electronvolt) are considered \"light,\" while those with masses above 1 keV are considered \"heavy.\"\n\nThe implications of this mass range for experimental searches for dark matter are as follows:\n\n1. Light gravitinos (sub-eV to keV): These gravitinos would behave as warm or hot dark matter, depending on their mass. They could be detected indirectly through their impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, as they would erase small-scale structures due to their free-streaming. However, direct detection of light gravitinos is challenging, as they would interact very weakly with ordinary matter.\n\n2. Heavy gravitinos (keV to TeV): These gravitinos would behave as cold dark matter, which is the leading candidate for the observed dark matter in the universe. Direct detection of heavy gravitinos is also difficult due to their weak interactions with ordinary matter. However, they could be produced in high-energy collisions at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), or indirectly detected through their decay products in cosmic rays or gamma-ray observations.\n\nIn summary, the broad mass range of gravitinos makes them an interesting candidate for dark matter, but it also poses challenges for experimental searches. Both direct and indirect detection methods are being pursued, with the hope that future experiments and observations will provide more insight into the nature of dark matter and the possible existence of gravitinos."
