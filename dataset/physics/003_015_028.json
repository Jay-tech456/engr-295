    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. The magnetic field due to a small segment of the loop is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment, θ is the angle between the current element and the position vector, and r is the distance from the segment to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nSince we want to find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, the angle θ will be 90 degrees for all segments, and sinθ will be 1. Also, the distance r from the center to each side of the square will be half of the side length.\n\nLet's calculate the magnetic field due to one side of the square loop and then multiply by 4 to account for all four sides.\n\nSide length = 15 cm = 0.15 m\nr = 0.15 m / 2 = 0.075 m\n\nThe magnetic field due to one side of the square loop is:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression over the length of one side of the square loop:\n\nB_side = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²) from 0 to 0.15\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) * ∫dl from 0 to 0.15\n\nB_side = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) * (0.15 - 0)\n\nB_side = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (4 * π * (0.075 m)²) * 0.15 m\n\nB_side = (12π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (9π × 0.075² m²) * 0.15 m\n\nB_side ≈ 0.0004 T\n\nNow, we need to account for all four sides of the square loop:\n\nB_total = 4 * B_side\n\nB_total = 4 * 0.0004 T\n\nB_total ≈ 0.0016 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 0.0016 T (Tesla)."
