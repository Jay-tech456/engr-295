If the refractive index of glass is 1.5, calculate the angle of polarization according to Brewster's Law.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use Brewster's Law, which states that the angle of incidence (θi) and the angle of polarization (θp) are related by the refractive indices of the two media (air and glass in this case). The formula for Brewster's Law is:\n\ntan(θp) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere θp is the angle of polarization, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (air), and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (glass).\n\nIn this problem, we are given the refractive index of glass (n2) as 1.5, and the refractive index of air (n1) is approximately 1.0. We can now plug these values into the formula:\n\ntan(θp) = 1.5 / 1.0\ntan(θp) = 1.5\n\nNow, to find the angle of polarization (θp), we need to take the arctangent of 1.5:\n\nθp = arctan(1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθp ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of polarization according to Brewster's Law is approximately 56.31 degrees."
