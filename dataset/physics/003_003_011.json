    "message_1": "A toroidal solenoid has 800 turns of wire and a mean radius of 10 cm. The current flowing through the wire is 2 A. Calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the toroidal solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀), the number of turns (N), and the current (I) divided by the length of the solenoid (l).\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / l\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, which is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length (l) of the solenoid. Since the solenoid is toroidal, its length is equal to the circumference of the circle with a mean radius (r) of 10 cm or 0.1 m.\n\nl = 2πr\nl = 2π(0.1 m)\nl ≈ 0.628 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 800 turns * 2 A) / 0.628 m\n\nB ≈ (3.2 × 10⁻⁴ T) / 0.628 m\n\nB ≈ 5.095 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field inside the toroidal solenoid is approximately 5.095 × 10⁻⁴ T or 509.5 μT."
