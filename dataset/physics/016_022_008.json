    "message_2": "The critical temperature (Tc) of a superconducting alloy depends on the specific composition and microstructure of the alloy. For a niobium-titanium (Nb-Ti) alloy with a 2:1 ratio, the critical temperature can be estimated based on the weighted average of the critical temperatures of pure niobium (Tc ≈ 9.2 K) and pure titanium (Tc ≈ 0.4 K).\n\nUsing the weighted average method, the critical temperature of the Nb-Ti alloy with a 2:1 ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nTc(Nb-Ti) = (2/3) * Tc(Nb) + (1/3) * Tc(Ti) = (2/3) * 9.2 K + (1/3) * 0.4 K ≈ 6.27 K\n\nIt is important to note that this is a rough estimation and the actual critical temperature may vary depending on the specific microstructure and preparation of the alloy.\n\nRegarding the comparison with other Nb-Ti alloys with different ratios, the critical temperature will generally increase with a higher proportion of niobium, as niobium has a higher critical temperature than titanium. However, the relationship between the composition and critical temperature is not necessarily linear, and other factors such as the microstructure and defects in the alloy can also influence the critical temperature. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a precise comparison without more information on the specific alloys in question."
