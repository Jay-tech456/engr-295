    "message_2": "To calculate the observed angle of a star moving at a relativistic speed, we need to take into account the relativistic aberration of light. The formula for relativistic aberration is given by:\n\nθ_obs = arcsin((sin(θ_theoretical))/(γ(1 + (v/c)cos(θ_theoretical))))\n\nwhere:\nθ_obs is the observed angle,\nθ_theoretical is the theoretical angle (20 degrees in this case),\nv is the relative velocity of the star (0.8c),\nc is the speed of light, and\nγ is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2)\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1/sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1/0.6\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, we can calculate the observed angle (θ_obs):\n\nθ_obs = arcsin((sin(20°))/(1.67(1 + (0.8c/c)cos(20°))))\nθ_obs = arcsin((sin(20°))/(1.67(1 + 0.8cos(20°))))\n\nConverting 20 degrees to radians (since most calculators and programming languages use radians for trigonometric functions):\n\n20° * (π/180) ≈ 0.349 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nθ_obs = arcsin((sin(0.349))/(1.67(1 + 0.8cos(0.349))))\nθ_obs ≈ arcsin((0.342)/(1.67(1 + 0.8*0.940))))\nθ_obs ≈ arcsin((0.342)/(1.67(1.752)))\nθ_obs ≈ arcsin((0.342)/(2.922))\nθ_obs ≈ arcsin(0.117)\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to degrees:\n\nθ_obs ≈ 0.117 * (180/π)\nθ_obs ≈ 6.71°\n\nSo, the observed angle of the star moving at 0.8c relative to an observer on Earth is approximately 6.71 degrees."
