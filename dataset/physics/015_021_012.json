    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency of gravitational waves produced by a black hole accretion disk, we need to determine the orbital frequency of the matter in the disk at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The ISCO radius depends on the mass and spin of the black hole.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the black hole has a mass of 10 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nThe problem states that the inner radius of the accretion disk is 3 times the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nR_inner = 3 * Rs ≈ 8.85 x 10^4 m\n\nNow we need to find the ISCO radius (R_isco) for a spinning black hole, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR_isco = Rs * (3 + Z2 - sqrt((3 - Z1)(3 + Z1 + 2 * Z2)))\n\nwhere Z1 = 1 + (1 - a^2)^(1/3) * ((1 + a)^(1/3) + (1 - a)^(1/3)) and Z2 = sqrt(3 * a^2 + Z1^2), and a is the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole.\n\nGiven that the spin of the black hole is 0.9:\n\na = 0.9\n\nNow we can calculate Z1 and Z2:\n\nZ1 = 1 + (1 - 0.9^2)^(1/3) * ((1 + 0.9)^(1/3) + (1 - 0.9)^(1/3))\nZ1 ≈ 1.56\n\nZ2 = sqrt(3 * 0.9^2 + Z1^2)\nZ2 ≈ 1.77\n\nNow we can find the ISCO radius:\n\nR_isco = Rs * (3 + 1.77 - sqrt((3 - 1.56)(3 + 1.56 + 2 * 1.77)))\nR_isco ≈ 4.23 * Rs ≈ 1.25 x 10^5 m\n\nNow we can calculate the orbital frequency (f_orbital) at the ISCO radius using the formula:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * M / R_isco^3)\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt((6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (1.25 x 10^5 m)^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 2.18 x 10^-4 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the accretion disk is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_gravitational_waves = 2 * f_orbital ≈ 4.36 x 10^-4 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the black hole accretion disk is approximately 4.36 x 10^-4 Hz."
