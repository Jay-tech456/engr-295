    "message_1": "A polarizer has a transmission axis making an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the vertical. A beam of light initially linearly polarized along the horizontal axis is incident on the polarizer. Determine the ratio of the intensity of the transmitted light to the intensity of the incident light.",
    "message_2": "To determine the ratio of the intensity of the transmitted light to the intensity of the incident light, we can use Malus' Law. Malus' Law states that the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, the transmission axis of the polarizer is at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the vertical axis, and the incident light is polarized along the horizontal axis. The angle between the transmission axis and the plane of polarization of the incident light is also 45 degrees.\n\nUsing Malus' Law, the ratio of the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) to the intensity of the incident light (I_i) is given by:\n\nI_t / I_i = cos^2(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the transmission axis and the plane of polarization of the incident light.\n\nSubstituting the given angle:\n\nI_t / I_i = cos^2(45°)\n\nSince cos(45°) = 1/√2,\n\nI_t / I_i = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the intensity of the transmitted light to the intensity of the incident light is 1/2, or 50%."
