    "message_1": "What is the estimated amount of energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion of a star with a mass of 30 times that of our Sun, assuming that the energy is radiated in the form of gravitational waves with a frequency of 100 Hz?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the amount of energy emitted in gravitational waves by a supernova explosion, we can use the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission. The formula is given by:\n\nE_GW = (G/c^5) * (d^2I/dt^2)^2 * T\n\nwhere E_GW is the energy emitted in gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, I is the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment, and T is the duration of the emission.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate the energy emitted using this formula. Instead, we can use a rough estimate based on the total energy released in a supernova explosion and the fraction of that energy emitted in gravitational waves.\n\nThe total energy released in a supernova explosion is typically around 10^44 Joules. The fraction of this energy emitted in gravitational waves is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be a small fraction, around 10^-4 to 10^-2.\n\nAssuming the fraction of energy emitted in gravitational waves is 10^-4, we can estimate the energy emitted in gravitational waves as:\n\nE_GW = 10^44 Joules * 10^-4 = 10^40 Joules\n\nThis is a rough estimate, and the actual energy emitted in gravitational waves could be higher or lower depending on the specific details of the supernova explosion and the fraction of energy emitted in gravitational waves."
