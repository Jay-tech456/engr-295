    "message_1": "What is the specific heat capacity of a block of aluminum that requires 150 J of energy to raise its temperature by 10°C, given that the mass of the block is 500 grams?",
    "message_2": "The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat energy absorbed or released (in joules), m is the mass of the substance (in kilograms), c is the specific heat capacity (in J/kg·°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following information:\n\nQ = 150 J (energy required)\nΔT = 10°C (temperature change)\nm = 500 grams = 0.5 kg (mass of the block, converted to kilograms)\n\nWe need to find the specific heat capacity (c) of the aluminum block. Rearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = Q / (mΔT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nc = 150 J / (0.5 kg × 10°C)\nc = 150 J / 5 kg·°C\nc = 30 J/kg·°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of the aluminum block is 30 J/kg·°C."
