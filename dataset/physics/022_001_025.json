    "message_2": "The most promising theoretical candidate for a dark matter particle based on current experimental evidence is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are thought to make up a significant portion of the dark matter in the universe.\n\nFor a particle to be a viable dark matter candidate, it must possess certain properties to explain observed astrophysical phenomena such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing. These properties include:\n\n1. Stability: The particle must be stable or have a very long lifetime, as dark matter is believed to have been present since the early universe.\n\n2. Non-luminous: The particle must not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that observe light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\n\n3. Massive: The particle must have mass, as its gravitational influence is responsible for the observed phenomena such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing.\n\n4. Weakly interacting: The particle must interact weakly with ordinary matter, meaning it does not readily interact through the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces. This property allows dark matter to pass through ordinary matter without significant interaction, making it difficult to detect directly.\n\n5. Cold: The particle must be \"cold,\" meaning it has a low velocity compared to the speed of light. This property is essential for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nExperimental searches for WIMPs are ongoing, using various techniques such as direct detection experiments, which look for the scattering of WIMPs off atomic nuclei, and indirect detection experiments, which search for the products of WIMP annihilation or decay. So far, no definitive evidence for WIMPs has been found, but they remain the leading candidate for dark matter particles."
