    "message_2": "The most commonly accepted particle that could potentially make up dark matter is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are thought to interact through the weak nuclear force and gravity, but not through the electromagnetic force, which makes them invisible to light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe experimental evidence for the existence of WIMPs comes from several indirect observations:\n\n1. Gravitational effects: The presence of dark matter has been inferred from the gravitational effects it has on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation. These observations suggest that there is more mass in the universe than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, and WIMPs are a leading candidate to explain this discrepancy.\n\n2. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe can be better explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps to hold these structures together. WIMPs are one of the leading candidates for this dark matter component.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its temperature fluctuations provide information about the early universe. The observed pattern of these fluctuations is consistent with the presence of dark matter, and WIMPs are a leading candidate to explain this observation.\n\nDespite these indirect pieces of evidence, direct detection of WIMPs has proven to be challenging. Several experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various underground detectors, are currently searching for WIMPs by looking for their interactions with ordinary matter. So far, no definitive evidence for WIMPs has been found, but the search continues, and new experiments are being developed to improve the sensitivity and expand the range of possible WIMP properties that can be probed."
