    "message_2": "The Penrose process is a mechanism that allows for the extraction of rotational energy from a rotating black hole, specifically from its ergosphere. The ergosphere is a region outside the event horizon where the spacetime is dragged along with the black hole's rotation due to a phenomenon called frame-dragging. In this region, it is possible to extract energy from the black hole's rotation.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. A particle with mass m enters the ergosphere of the rotating black hole.\n2. Inside the ergosphere, the particle splits into two smaller particles, A and B, with masses mA and mB, respectively (m = mA + mB).\n3. Particle A falls into the black hole, while particle B escapes to infinity.\n4. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, particle A has negative energy relative to an observer at infinity. This means that when particle A is captured by the black hole, the black hole loses some of its rotational energy.\n5. Particle B, which escapes to infinity, carries away the energy extracted from the black hole. The energy of particle B is greater than the initial energy of the original particle (m), resulting in a net gain of energy.\n\nThe maximum efficiency that can be achieved in the Penrose process is determined by the properties of the black hole, specifically its angular momentum and mass. The efficiency is given by the following formula:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - sqrt(1 - a^2)) * 100%\n\nwhere 'a' is the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole, defined as:\n\na = J / (GM^2/c)\n\nHere, J is the angular momentum of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. The spin parameter 'a' ranges from 0 (non-rotating black hole) to 1 (extremal black hole, rotating at the maximum possible rate).\n\nFor a maximally rotating black hole (a = 1), the maximum efficiency of the Penrose process is:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - sqrt(1 - 1^2)) * 100% = 29.3%\n\nSo, the maximum efficiency that can be achieved in extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Penrose process is 29.3%."
