Calculate the force per unit area using the formula derived from the sum of zero-point energies of electromagnetic fields between the plates.",
    "message_2": "The Casimir force is a physical force experienced by two parallel conducting plates due to the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field between them. The force is attractive and depends on the distance between the plates. The formula for the Casimir force per unit area (F/A) between two parallel plates separated by a distance 'a' is given by:\n\nF/A = -(π²ħc) / (240a⁴)\n\nwhere:\nF is the Casimir force,\nA is the area of the plates,\na is the distance between the plates,\nħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ Js),\nc is the speed of light in vacuum (approximately 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s),\nand π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159265).\n\nBy substituting the values of ħ, c, and π into the formula, we can calculate the Casimir force per unit area for a given distance 'a' between the plates."
