    "message_2": "When quantum mechanics is taken into account, the behavior of black holes changes significantly, particularly in relation to the phenomenon of Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is a process by which black holes can lose mass and eventually evaporate. This concept was first proposed by the physicist Stephen Hawking in 1974.\n\nIn classical general relativity, black holes are described by the event horizon, a boundary from which nothing can escape, not even light. However, when quantum mechanics is considered, the situation becomes more complex.\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces the concept of quantum fluctuations, which are temporary changes in energy that occur in empty space due to the uncertainty principle. These fluctuations can create virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that spontaneously form and annihilate each other. Near the event horizon of a black hole, these fluctuations can have significant consequences.\n\nWhen a virtual particle-antiparticle pair forms near the event horizon, it is possible for one of the particles to fall into the black hole while the other escapes. This process effectively separates the pair, preventing them from annihilating each other. The escaping particle is then considered \"real\" and contributes to the Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole.\n\nAs a result of this process, the black hole loses mass over time. The energy carried away by the escaping particles is taken from the mass of the black hole, causing it to shrink. This effect is more pronounced for smaller black holes, as they have a higher surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher rate of Hawking radiation emission.\n\nIn the context of quantum mechanics, black holes are no longer completely black, as they emit Hawking radiation. This also resolves the information paradox, which arises in classical general relativity, where information about the particles that formed the black hole is seemingly lost. In the quantum mechanical description, the information is encoded in the correlations between the emitted Hawking radiation and the internal state of the black hole, allowing for the possibility of information preservation.\n\nIn summary, when quantum mechanics is taken into account, the behavior of black holes changes significantly, particularly in relation to the phenomenon of Hawking radiation. Black holes can lose mass and eventually evaporate due to the emission of Hawking radiation, which arises from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon. This process also has implications for the information paradox, suggesting that information may not be lost in black holes after all."
