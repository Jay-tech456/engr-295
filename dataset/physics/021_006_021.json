    "message_2": "The gravity of a supermassive black hole can significantly affect the orbits of nearby stars. Due to the immense mass of the black hole, it exerts a strong gravitational force on the surrounding stars, causing them to follow elliptical or even highly eccentric orbits around the black hole. These orbits can be perturbed over time due to gravitational interactions with other stars or the black hole itself, leading to changes in their trajectories.\n\nTo determine the exact changes in the trajectories of nearby stars over time, we can use the following calculations:\n\n1. Newton's law of universal gravitation: This law states that the force between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The equation is:\n\n   F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\n\n   where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them.\n\n2. Kepler's laws of planetary motion: These laws describe the motion of celestial bodies around a central mass, such as stars orbiting a black hole. The three laws are:\n\n   a. The orbit of a star is an ellipse with the black hole at one of the two foci.\n   b. A line segment joining a star and the black hole sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.\n   c. The square of the orbital period of a star is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\n3. Numerical integration methods: To calculate the exact changes in the trajectories of nearby stars over time, we can use numerical integration methods like the Verlet algorithm or the Runge-Kutta method. These methods allow us to solve the equations of motion for the stars, taking into account the gravitational forces acting on them due to the black hole and other nearby stars.\n\nBy combining these calculations and methods, we can determine the changes in the trajectories of nearby stars over time as they orbit a supermassive black hole. This information can help us better understand the dynamics of galaxies and the role of supermassive black holes in their evolution."
