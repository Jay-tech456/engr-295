    "message_1": "A heat engine takes in heat from a source at 600 K and rejects heat to a sink at 300 K. Calculate the Carnot efficiency of the engine.",
    "message_2": "The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures. It is given by the formula:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)\n\nwhere T_cold is the temperature of the cold reservoir (in Kelvin) and T_hot is the temperature of the hot reservoir (in Kelvin).\n\nIn this case, T_hot = 600 K and T_cold = 300 K. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCarnot efficiency = 1 - (300 K / 600 K) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo the Carnot efficiency of the engine is 0.5 or 50%."
