    "message_2": "Gravitational redshift, also known as gravitational shift or gravitational redshift of light, is a phenomenon that occurs when light or other electromagnetic radiation travels away from a massive object such as a planet, star, or black hole. Due to the influence of gravity, the wavelength of the light gets stretched, causing it to shift towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This effect is a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity, which describes how gravity affects the spacetime fabric.\n\nThe Doppler shift, on the other hand, is a change in the frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It occurs for any type of wave, including sound and light waves. When the source and the observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency increases (blueshift), and when they are moving away from each other, the observed frequency decreases (redshift).\n\nThe main difference between gravitational redshift and Doppler shift lies in the cause of the frequency change. Gravitational redshift is caused by the influence of gravity on light as it moves through spacetime, whereas the Doppler shift is caused by the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. In other words, gravitational redshift is a result of the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of a massive object, while the Doppler shift is a result of the relative velocities of the source and the observer.\n\nAnother difference is that gravitational redshift is always a redshift, meaning the frequency of the light always decreases as it moves away from the massive object, regardless of the direction of motion. In contrast, the Doppler shift can be either a redshift or a blueshift, depending on whether the source and observer are moving away from or towards each other.\n\nIn summary, gravitational redshift and Doppler shift are two distinct phenomena that cause changes in the frequency or wavelength of light or other waves. Gravitational redshift is due to the influence of gravity on light as it travels through spacetime, while the Doppler shift is caused by the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer."
