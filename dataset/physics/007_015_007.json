    "message_2": "The effective range of nuclear forces, also known as the strong nuclear force or strong force, is approximately 1 to 3 femtometers (1 fm = 10^-15 meters). This force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus, overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons.\n\nThe stability of atomic nuclei is significantly impacted by the effective range of nuclear forces. Since the strong force has a short range, it is most effective in binding together nucleons (protons and neutrons) that are in close proximity. As a result, smaller nuclei with fewer nucleons are generally more stable, as the strong force can effectively bind all the nucleons together.\n\nAs the size of the nucleus increases, the strong force becomes less effective at holding the nucleus together, due to its short range. In larger nuclei, the electrostatic repulsion between protons starts to play a more significant role, making the nucleus less stable. This is why heavier elements, with larger nuclei, are generally more unstable and prone to radioactive decay.\n\nIn addition to the strong force, the stability of atomic nuclei is also influenced by other factors, such as the balance between protons and neutrons (the neutron-to-proton ratio) and the shell structure of the nucleus. The most stable nuclei have a balance between protons and neutrons that allows the strong force to effectively counteract the electrostatic repulsion, and they also have filled nuclear shells, which provide additional stability due to the shell structure."
