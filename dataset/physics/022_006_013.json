    "message_2": "The interaction between dark matter and normal matter plays a crucial role in explaining the observed rotation curves of galaxies. A rotation curve is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars or gas in a galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galaxy's center. According to classical physics and the distribution of visible matter, we would expect the velocities to decrease as we move further away from the center of the galaxy, similar to the behavior of planets in our solar system.\n\nHowever, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the velocities of stars and gas do not decrease as expected. Instead, they remain relatively constant or even slightly increase as we move further away from the center. This discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the expected behavior based on visible matter alone suggests the presence of an additional, unseen mass component in galaxies, which we call dark matter.\n\nDark matter is believed to be a form of non-luminous, non-baryonic matter that interacts primarily through gravity. It forms a halo around galaxies, providing additional gravitational force that affects the motion of stars and gas within the galaxy. The presence of dark matter increases the total mass of the galaxy, which in turn affects the gravitational force acting on the visible matter, causing the observed flat or slightly increasing rotation curves.\n\nTo indirectly detect the presence of dark matter using rotation curves, astronomers measure the velocities of stars and gas at various distances from the center of a galaxy. They then compare these observed velocities with the velocities predicted by the distribution of visible matter alone. If the observed velocities are higher than the predicted velocities, especially at larger distances from the center, this suggests the presence of additional mass in the form of dark matter.\n\nBy analyzing the discrepancies between the observed and predicted rotation curves, astronomers can estimate the amount and distribution of dark matter within a galaxy. This indirect detection method has provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and has helped to shape our current understanding of the composition and structure of the universe."
