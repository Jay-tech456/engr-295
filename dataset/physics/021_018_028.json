    "message_2": "Gravitational lensing occurs when the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a black hole, bends the path of light from a distant star. This bending of light is due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the massive object, as described by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nTo calculate the deflection angle (α) of light passing near a black hole, we can use the formula derived from general relativity:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance the light would pass by the black hole if it were not deflected.\n\nLet's assume a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg) and a distance of closest approach (impact parameter) of 1 light-year (9.461 x 10^15 m).\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 x 10^30 kg) = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\nb = 9.461 x 10^15 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the deflection angle:\n\nα = (4 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 x 10^31 kg) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * 9.461 x 10^15 m)\nα ≈ 8.375 x 10^-6 radians\n\nTo determine the apparent position of the star as seen from Earth, we need to know the actual position of the star and the distance between the black hole and the Earth. Let's assume the black hole is located halfway between the Earth and the star, and the distance between the Earth and the star is 10 light-years (9.461 x 10^16 m).\n\nThe angular separation between the black hole and the star as seen from Earth can be calculated using the small angle approximation:\n\nθ = d / D\n\nwhere d is the distance between the black hole and the star (5 light-years or 4.7305 x 10^16 m), and D is the distance between the Earth and the star (10 light-years or 9.461 x 10^16 m).\n\nθ ≈ 4.7305 x 10^16 m / 9.461 x 10^16 m\nθ ≈ 0.5 radians\n\nNow, we can find the apparent position of the star by adding the deflection angle to the actual angular separation:\n\nApparent position ≈ θ + α\nApparent position ≈ 0.5 radians + 8.375 x 10^-6 radians\nApparent position ≈ 0.500008375 radians\n\nSo, the apparent position of the star as seen from Earth is slightly shifted from its actual position due to the gravitational lensing effect caused by the black hole."
