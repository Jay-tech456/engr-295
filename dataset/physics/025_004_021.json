    "message_2": "To calculate the change in free energy (ΔG) for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(Keq)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (37°C = 310.15 K), and Keq is the equilibrium constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equilibrium constant (Keq) for the reaction. We can use the rate constant (k) and the concentrations of the substrate (S) and product (P) to find Keq:\n\nKeq = [P]/[S]\n\nGiven the initial concentration of the substrate is 1.5 mM and the final concentration of the product is 0.8 mM, we can calculate Keq:\n\nKeq = 0.8 mM / 1.5 mM = 0.5333\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the ΔG equation:\n\nΔG = - (8.314 J/mol·K) × (310.15 K) × ln(0.5333)\n\nΔG = - (2585.3 J/mol) × (-0.6277)\n\nΔG = 1622.5 J/mol\n\nThe change in free energy for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction at 37°C with the given conditions is approximately 1622.5 J/mol."
