    "message_2": "To find the minimum focal length of a convex lens, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = (n - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. For a biconvex lens, R1 and R2 have the same magnitude but opposite signs, so we can write:\n\n1/f = (n - 1)(1/R - 1/(-R))\n\nGiven the refractive index n = 1.5 and the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\n1/f = (1.5 - 1)(1/20 - 1/(-20))\n1/f = 0.5 * (1/20 + 1/20)\n1/f = 0.5 * (2/20)\n1/f = 1/20\n\nTherefore, the focal length f is:\n\nf = 20 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum focal length required for a magnification of 4x. The magnification formula for a lens is:\n\nM = -(v/u)\n\nwhere M is the magnification, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance. The lens formula is:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nWe want to find the minimum focal length, so we need to find the minimum value of v that gives a magnification of 4x. Since M = -4, we have:\n\nv = -4u\n\nSubstitute this into the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/(-4u)\n\nTo find the minimum focal length, we need to find the maximum value of 1/u + 1/(-4u). This occurs when u is at its minimum value. For a convex lens, the minimum object distance is when the object is at the focal point:\n\nu = f\n\nSo, the minimum focal length required for a magnification of 4x is:\n\nf_min = 20 cm"
