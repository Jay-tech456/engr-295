    "message_2": "The Van der Waals equation of state is given by:\n\n(P + a(n/V)^2)(V - nb) = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and a and b are the Van der Waals constants for the gas.\n\nBoyle temperature is the temperature at which the gas obeys Boyle's law (PV = constant) within the Van der Waals equation. At Boyle temperature, the term involving the Van der Waals constant 'a' becomes negligible. So, the Van der Waals equation becomes:\n\nP(V - nb) = nRT\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the Boyle temperature (T):\n\nT = P(V - nb) / nR\n\nWe are given the values of P, V, n, a, and b:\n\nP = 3 atm\nV = 20 L\nn = 1 mol\na = 1.39 atm L^2/mol^2\nb = 0.0391 L/mol\n\nThe gas constant R for the units used in this problem is:\n\nR = 0.0821 L atm/mol K\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation for T:\n\nT = (3 atm)(20 L - 1 mol × 0.0391 L/mol) / (1 mol × 0.0821 L atm/mol K)\n\nT = (3 atm)(19.9609 L) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K)\n\nT = 72.895 K\n\nSo, the Boyle temperature of 1 mole of nitrogen gas at a pressure of 3 atm and a volume of 20 L is approximately 72.9 K."
