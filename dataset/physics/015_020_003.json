    "message_2": "The expected rate of gravitational wave detections from a population of binary white dwarfs depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the number of binary white dwarf systems, and their distribution in the universe. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based gravitational wave observatory that will be sensitive to the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by binary white dwarfs.\n\nThe rate of gravitational wave detections can be estimated using the following steps:\n\n1. Estimate the number density of binary white dwarfs in the universe. This can be done using observations of binary white dwarfs in our galaxy and extrapolating to the entire universe. Current estimates suggest there are about 10^8 - 10^9 binary white dwarf systems in the Milky Way.\n\n2. Calculate the gravitational wave strain amplitude for a typical binary white dwarf system. This depends on the masses of the white dwarfs, their orbital separation, and the distance to the system. The strain amplitude decreases with increasing distance from the system.\n\n3. Determine the detection threshold for the gravitational wave detector (e.g., LISA). This depends on the sensitivity of the detector and the observation time.\n\n4. Calculate the detection volume, which is the volume of space within which a binary white dwarf system would produce a gravitational wave signal above the detection threshold. This volume will be larger for closer systems and smaller for more distant systems.\n\n5. Estimate the number of binary white dwarf systems within the detection volume. This can be done by multiplying the number density of binary white dwarfs by the detection volume.\n\n6. Finally, calculate the expected rate of gravitational wave detections by dividing the number of systems within the detection volume by the observation time.\n\nThe dependence of the detection rate on the distance of the systems from Earth comes from the fact that the gravitational wave strain amplitude decreases with increasing distance. As a result, more distant systems are less likely to produce a detectable signal, and the detection volume will be smaller for more distant systems. This means that the expected rate of detections will be higher for binary white dwarf systems that are closer to Earth."
