    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving other particles mass through the Higgs mechanism. It was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. The expected decay modes of the Higgs boson are as follows:\n\n1. Higgs boson to bottom quark-antiquark pair (H → bb): This is the most common decay mode, with a branching ratio of about 58%.\n\n2. Higgs boson to W boson pair (H → WW): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 21%. One of the W bosons will decay into a lepton and a neutrino, while the other decays into a quark-antiquark pair.\n\n3. Higgs boson to Z boson pair (H → ZZ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.6%. One or both of the Z bosons will decay into a pair of leptons or quarks.\n\n4. Higgs boson to tau lepton-antilepton pair (H → ττ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 6.3%.\n\n5. Higgs boson to gluon pair (H → gg): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 8.6%. This process occurs through a loop of virtual top quarks.\n\n6. Higgs boson to photon pair (H → γγ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.2%. This process occurs through a loop of virtual charged particles, such as W bosons or top quarks.\n\n7. Higgs boson to muon-antimuon pair (H → μμ): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 0.02%.\n\n8. Higgs boson to charm quark-antiquark pair (H → cc): This decay mode has a branching ratio of about 2.9%.\n\nThe properties of the Higgs boson, such as its mass, spin, and parity, can be studied through its decay products. By analyzing the energy, momentum, and angular distributions of the decay products, physicists can determine the properties of the Higgs boson. For example, the mass of the Higgs boson can be inferred from the invariant mass of its decay products, while its spin and parity can be determined from the angular distributions of the decay products. Additionally, measuring the rates of different decay modes can help to verify the predictions of the Standard Model and potentially reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model."
