    "message_1": "A rectangular loop with dimensions of 10 cm by 20 cm carries a current of 2 A. Determine the magnetic field at a point P located 5 cm from one of the corners of the loop, taking the direction perpendicular to the plane of the loop as positive.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four straight segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment separately. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields to find the total magnetic field at point P.\n\nLet's label the corners of the loop as A, B, C, and D, with point P being 5 cm away from corner A. The four segments are AB, BC, CD, and DA.\n\n1. Segment AB:\nLength = 10 cm\nDirection of current: from A to B\ndl = 0.1 m (along the x-axis)\n\n2. Segment BC:\nLength = 20 cm\nDirection of current: from B to C\ndl = 0.2 m (along the y-axis)\n\n3. Segment CD:\nLength = 10 cm\nDirection of current: from C to D\ndl = -0.1 m (along the x-axis)\n\n4. Segment DA:\nLength = 20 cm\nDirection of current: from D to A\ndl = -0.2 m (along the y-axis)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to each segment using the Biot-Savart law and sum them up. Note that due to symmetry, the magnetic fields due to segments AB and CD will cancel each other out, as will the magnetic fields due to segments BC and DA.\n\nSo, we only need to calculate the magnetic field due to one of the segments, say segment BC.\n\nr = 0.05 m (along the z-axis)\ndl x r = (0.2 m along y-axis) x (0.05 m along z-axis) = -0.01 m² (along x-axis)\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\ndB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / (4π) * (2 A * (-0.01 m² along x-axis)) / (0.05 m)³\ndB = -2 × 10⁻⁶ T (along x-axis)\n\nSince the magnetic field due to segment BC is along the negative x-axis, the magnetic field due to segment DA will be along the positive x-axis with the same magnitude. Therefore, the total magnetic field at point P is zero."
