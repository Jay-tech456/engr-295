When it is passed through the polarizer, the intensity of the polarized light is found to be 2 W/m². What is the angle between the polarizer and the incident light? (Use Malus' Law to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light (I) after passing through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (θ) between the polarizer's axis and the plane of polarization of the incident light. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nI = I₀ * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I₀ is the intensity of the incident light and θ is the angle between the polarizer and the incident light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the intensity of the incident light (I₀) as 5 W/m² and the intensity of the polarized light (I) as 2 W/m². We need to find the angle θ.\n\n2 W/m² = 5 W/m² * cos²(θ)\n\nTo solve for θ, first, we need to find the value of cos²(θ):\n\ncos²(θ) = (2 W/m²) / (5 W/m²) = 0.4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.6325\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found:\n\nθ = arccos(0.6325) ≈ 49.46°\n\nSo, the angle between the polarizer and the incident light is approximately 49.46°."
