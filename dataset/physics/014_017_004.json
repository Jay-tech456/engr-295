    "message_2": "The maximum energy of cosmic rays that can cause damage to electronics used in space missions is in the range of several billion electron volts (GeV) to trillions of electron volts (TeV). Cosmic rays with these high energies can cause single-event effects (SEEs) in electronic devices, such as single-event upsets (SEUs), latch-ups, and gate ruptures, which can lead to malfunctions or even permanent damage.\n\nTo protect electronics in space missions from cosmic rays, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. Shielding: Using materials like aluminum, polyethylene, or other composites can help absorb and deflect some of the incoming cosmic rays. However, shielding can only provide limited protection, as very high-energy cosmic rays can still penetrate the shielding.\n\n2. Radiation-hardened components: Designing and using electronic components that are specifically built to withstand the effects of radiation can help minimize the damage caused by cosmic rays. These components are made using specialized manufacturing processes and materials that are more resistant to radiation-induced damage.\n\n3. Redundancy: Incorporating multiple redundant systems in the spacecraft can help ensure that if one system is damaged by cosmic rays, there are backup systems in place to take over the affected functions.\n\n4. Error detection and correction: Implementing error detection and correction techniques in the electronic systems can help identify and correct errors caused by cosmic rays. This can include using parity bits, checksums, or more advanced error-correcting codes.\n\n5. Active monitoring and mitigation: Continuously monitoring the health of the electronic systems and having onboard systems in place to mitigate the effects of cosmic rays, such as resetting affected components or switching to backup systems, can help minimize the impact of cosmic rays on the mission.\n\nBy combining these strategies, space missions can be better prepared to handle the effects of cosmic rays on their electronics and ensure the success of their missions."
