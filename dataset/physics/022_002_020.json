    "message_2": "The percentage abundance of dark matter in the universe is approximately 27%. This value is calculated using various observational evidence and theoretical models in cosmology.\n\nOne of the primary methods for determining the abundance of dark matter is through the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. By studying the temperature fluctuations in the CMB, scientists can infer the composition of the universe, including the relative amounts of dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter.\n\nAnother method for estimating the abundance of dark matter is through the study of galaxy clusters and their gravitational effects. Dark matter does not emit or absorb light, but its presence can be inferred through its gravitational influence on visible matter. By observing the motion of galaxies within clusters and the distribution of hot gas, scientists can estimate the total mass of the cluster, including the contribution from dark matter.\n\nAdditionally, the large-scale structure of the universe, such as the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, can also provide information about the abundance of dark matter. The formation of these structures is influenced by the gravitational pull of dark matter, and by comparing the observed distribution of galaxies with theoretical models, scientists can estimate the percentage of dark matter in the universe.\n\nTaking into account these various lines of evidence, the current best estimate for the composition of the universe is approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and 5% ordinary matter."
