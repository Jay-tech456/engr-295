    "message_2": "A supernova is a massive explosion that occurs at the end of a star's life cycle, resulting in the release of an enormous amount of energy. The energy released from a supernova explosion can be roughly estimated using the concept of binding energy, which is the energy required to hold the star together against the force of gravity.\n\nThe energy released during a supernova explosion can be approximated as:\n\nE = 0.1 * M * c^2\n\nwhere E is the energy released, M is the mass of the star, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second). The factor 0.1 is used because only about 10% of the star's mass is converted into energy during the explosion.\n\nThe mass of the star plays a significant role in determining the energy released during a supernova explosion. More massive stars have stronger gravitational forces acting on them, which means they require more energy to counteract these forces. As a result, more massive stars release more energy when they explode.\n\nFor example, let's consider two stars with masses M1 and M2, where M1 > M2. Using the formula above, we can see that the energy released by the more massive star (M1) would be greater than the energy released by the less massive star (M2):\n\nE1 = 0.1 * M1 * c^2 > 0.1 * M2 * c^2 = E2\n\nIn summary, the energy released from a supernova explosion is directly proportional to the mass of the star that exploded. More massive stars release more energy during a supernova explosion than less massive stars. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and the actual energy released during a supernova explosion can be influenced by various factors, such as the star's composition and the specific processes occurring during the explosion."
