    "message_2": "To determine the magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror, we first need to find the image distance using the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven:\nf = 20 cm\ndo = 30 cm\n\nWe can now solve for di:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(30 + 20) / (20 * 30) = 1/di\n\nNow, we can solve for di:\n\ndi = (20 * 30) / (30 + 20)\ndi = 600 / 50\ndi = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the image distance, we can find the magnification using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di / do\n\nM = -12 / 30\nM = -0.4\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave mirror is -0.4. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted."
