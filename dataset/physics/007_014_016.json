    "message_2": "The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus. In this case, there are 6 protons, so the atomic number is 6.\n\nThe mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. In this case, there are 6 protons and 8 neutrons, so the mass number is 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the atom has an atomic number of 6 and a mass number of 14."
