    "message_2": "To determine the position and nature of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (u) is 15 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/15 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(15 + 10v) / (15v) = 1/10\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n10(15 + 10v) = 15v\n\n150 + 100v = 15v\n\nNow, isolate v:\n\n100v - 15v = 150\n\n85v = 150\n\nv = 150 / 85\n\nv â‰ˆ 1.76 cm\n\nThe image distance (v) is approximately 1.76 cm. Since the image distance is positive, the image is real and inverted. The image is also smaller than the object because the image distance is less than the object distance (1.76 cm < 15 cm)."
