    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the generator, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop of current, also known as the Biot-Savart Law. The formula is:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current (2 A),\nR is the radius of the generator (10 cm or 0.1 m),\nx is the distance from the center of the generator to the point (5 cm or 0.05 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * ((0.1 m)² + (0.05 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (2 * (0.01 m² + 0.0025 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-9) Tm) / (2 * (0.0125 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB ≈ 2.01 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located 5 cm away from the generator is approximately 2.01 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla)."
