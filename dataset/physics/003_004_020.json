    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a current-carrying loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the loop, and x is the distance from the center of the loop. In this case, we are looking for the magnetic field at the center of the loop, so x = 0.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.1 m)²) / (2 * (0.1 m)²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm * 0.01 m²) / (0.01 m²)^(3/2)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.01 m)\n\nB ≈ 2.5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the loop is approximately 2.5 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
