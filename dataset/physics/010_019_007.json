    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 liters of pure water. A salt solution with a concentration of 10 kg/m³ is added into the tank at a constant rate of 5 liters/min. Assuming complete mixing, what is the concentration of salt in the tank after 3 hours? (The density of the solution is assumed to be constant at 1000 kg/m³.) How much salt has been added to the tank by that time?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how much salt solution has been added to the tank after 3 hours. \n\n3 hours = 180 minutes\n\nAt a rate of 5 liters/min, the total volume of salt solution added is:\n\n5 liters/min * 180 min = 900 liters\n\nNow, the total volume of the mixture in the tank is:\n\n500 liters (initial water) + 900 liters (added salt solution) = 1400 liters\n\nNext, let's find out how much salt has been added to the tank. The salt solution has a concentration of 10 kg/m³, which is equal to 0.01 kg/liter (since 1 m³ = 1000 liters). \n\nSo, the amount of salt added is:\n\n900 liters * 0.01 kg/liter = 9 kg\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of salt in the tank after 3 hours:\n\nConcentration = (Amount of salt) / (Total volume of the mixture)\n\nConcentration = 9 kg / 1400 liters = 0.00642857 kg/liter\n\nTo express the concentration in kg/m³, we can multiply by 1000:\n\n0.00642857 kg/liter * 1000 = 6.42857 kg/m³\n\nSo, the concentration of salt in the tank after 3 hours is approximately 6.43 kg/m³, and the total amount of salt added to the tank is 9 kg."
