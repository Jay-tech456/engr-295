    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the converging lens, we can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven:\nf = 15 cm (converging lens)\nu = -20 cm (object distance is negative as per the sign convention)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/15 = 1/v - 1/(-20)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20) to get rid of the fractions:\n\n4 = 3v + 2v\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n5v = 4\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\nv = 4/5\n\nv = 0.8 cm\n\nSince the value of v is positive, the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens from the object, which means it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) of the image:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -0.8 / (-20)\n\nM = 0.04\n\nSince the magnification is less than 1, the image is smaller than the object. And since the magnification is positive, the image is inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the image formed by the converging lens is a real, inverted, and smaller image located 0.8 cm away from the lens on the opposite side of the object."
