When a beam of light with a wavelength of 600 nm passes through the grating, it produces a diffraction pattern on a screen placed 2.5 meters away. Determine the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum in the pattern.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the angular position of the maxima in a diffraction grating:\n\nsin(θ) = m * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th order maximum, m is the order of the maximum (in this case, m = 2 for the second-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light (600 nm), and d is the distance between the lines in the grating.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of lines per cm to the distance between the lines (d). Since there are 8000 lines per cm, we have:\n\nd = 1 cm / 8000 lines = 1 * 10^(-2) m / 8000 = 1.25 * 10^(-6) m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = 2 * (600 * 10^(-9) m / 1.25 * 10^(-6) m)\nsin(θ) = 0.96\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arcsin(0.96) ≈ 1.23 radians\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can use trigonometry to find the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum on the screen. Since the screen is 2.5 meters away, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = (distance between maxima) / 2.5 m\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\ndistance between maxima = 2.5 m * tan(1.23) ≈ 3.30 m\n\nSo, the distance between the central maximum and the second-order maximum in the pattern is approximately 3.30 meters."
