    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It is the point of no return for any object approaching the black hole. The size of the event horizon is directly related to the mass of the black hole.\n\nThe relationship between the event horizon and the mass of a black hole can be described using the Schwarzschild radius formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius (Rs) = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere:\nRs is the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon),\nG is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2),\nM is the mass of the black hole,\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nTo calculate the event horizon for a black hole with a mass 10 times that of our sun, we first need to know the mass of the sun. The mass of the sun is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10 * (1.989 × 10^30 kg) = 1.989 × 10^31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 × 10^31 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon for a black hole with a mass 10 times that of our sun is approximately 29.5 kilometers."
