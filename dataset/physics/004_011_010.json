    "message_2": "The Reissner-Nordström metric describes a charged, non-rotating black hole. The metric is given by:\n\nds² = -(1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²) dt² + (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²),\n\nwhere M is the mass of the black hole, Q is its electric charge, and r, θ, and φ are the usual spherical coordinates.\n\nThe electric field near the event horizon can be found by considering the Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. For a spherically symmetric, static spacetime, the electric field can be expressed as:\n\nE = Q / (4πε₀r²) * (1 - 2M/r + Q²/r²)⁻1/2,\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nAs you approach the event horizon, the electric field becomes stronger. The event horizon of a Reissner-Nordström black hole is located at:\n\nr_± = M ± (M² - Q²)^(1/2),\n\nwhere r_+ is the outer event horizon and r_- is the inner event horizon (also known as the Cauchy horizon). For an extremal black hole (M² = Q²), there is only one event horizon, and the electric field becomes infinite at the horizon.\n\nThe electric charge of the black hole affects the curvature of spacetime as you approach the event horizon. The presence of the electric charge term (Q²/r²) in the metric modifies the geometry of spacetime compared to the uncharged Schwarzschild black hole. This modification results in the existence of two event horizons (outer and inner) for a charged black hole, as opposed to only one event horizon for an uncharged black hole.\n\nIn summary, the electric field near the event horizon of a charged black hole described by the Reissner-Nordström metric becomes stronger as you approach the horizon. The electric charge of the black hole affects the curvature of spacetime, resulting in the existence of two event horizons and modifying the geometry of spacetime compared to an uncharged black hole."
