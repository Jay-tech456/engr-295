    "message_1": "A current-carrying inductor has a radius of 10 cm and consists of 100 turns. The current flowing through it is 2 A. What is the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the inductor, at a distance of 5 cm from the center? Assume that the inductance is ideal and neglect any external magnetic fields.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the inductor, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of turns per unit length (n). The inductor has a radius of 10 cm, so its length (assuming it's a cylindrical solenoid) is 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm = 0.2 m. It has 100 turns, so:\n\nn = 100 turns / 0.2 m = 500 turns/m\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field inside the solenoid:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (500 turns/m) * (2 A)\nB = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1000 A/m\nB = 4π × 10^(-4) T\n\nHowever, this is the magnetic field inside the solenoid. To find the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the inductor, at a distance of 5 cm from the center, we can use the formula for the axial magnetic field of a finite solenoid:\n\nB_axial = (μ₀ * n * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2 + x^2)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B_axial is the axial magnetic field, R is the radius of the solenoid (0.1 m), and x is the distance from the center (0.05 m).\n\nB_axial = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 500 turns/m * 2 A * (0.1 m)^2) / (2 * ((0.1 m)^2 + (0.05 m)^2)^(3/2))\nB_axial = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1000 A/m * 0.01 m^2) / (2 * (0.01 m^2 + 0.0025 m^2)^(3/2))\nB_axial = (4π × 10^(-4) T * 0.01 m^2) / (2 * (0.0125 m^2)^(3/2))\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nB_axial ≈ 0.00012566 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the inductor, at a distance of 5 cm from the center, is approximately 0.00012566 T or 125.66 μT."
