    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum frequency of light required to overcome the work function of the metal surface, we can use the following equation:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy required to overcome the work function (threshold energy), h is the Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the threshold energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So, the threshold energy in joules is:\n\nE = 2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.204 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can use the Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js, to find the minimum frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (3.204 x 10^-19 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 4.835 x 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the minimum frequency of light required to overcome the work function of the metal surface is approximately 4.835 x 10^14 Hz."
