    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the coil, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I). For a tightly wound coil of wire, composed of N identical turns, each with a radius r, the formula for the magnetic field at the center of the coil is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field at the center of the coil,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nN is the number of turns in the coil,\nI is the current passing through the coil, and\nr is the radius of the coil.\n\nGiven the problem's parameters:\nN = 100 turns,\nr = 5 cm = 0.05 m (converted to meters),\nI = 2 A.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 100 * 2 A) / (2 * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.05 m\n\nB ≈ (1.6π × 10^(-5) T) / 0.05\n\nB ≈ 1.005 × 10^(-3) T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the coil is approximately 1.005 × 10^(-3) T or 1.005 mT (millitesla)."
