    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the excited state, we first need to determine the energy difference between the n=3 and n=2 states using the Rydberg formula:\n\nΔE = E3 - E2 = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n3^2)\n\nwhere n2 = 2 and n3 = 3, and the energy is in electron volts (eV).\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1/9) = -13.6 eV * (5/36) = -1.89 eV\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency (ν) of the emitted photon using the wavelength (λ) provided:\n\nν = c / λ\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) and λ = 656.3 nm = 656.3 x 10^-9 m.\n\nν = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (656.3 x 10^-9 m) = 4.57 x 10^14 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the energy of the emitted photon (E_photon) using the Planck's constant (h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js):\n\nE_photon = h * ν = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (4.57 x 10^14 Hz) = 3.03 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can convert the energy difference (ΔE) from eV to Joules:\n\nΔE = -1.89 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = -3.03 x 10^-19 J\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) and the energy of the emitted photon (E_photon) should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, which is the case here.\n\nNow, we can use the uncertainty principle to calculate the natural lifetime (τ) of the excited state:\n\nΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h / 2π = 1.055 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nτ ≥ ħ / (2 * ΔE) = (1.055 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 3.03 x 10^-19 J) = 8.71 x 10^-16 s\n\nSo, the natural lifetime of the excited state is approximately 8.71 x 10^-16 seconds. This is the time it takes for the electron to spontaneously decay from the n=3 state to the n=2 state and emit a photon of wavelength 656.3 nm."
