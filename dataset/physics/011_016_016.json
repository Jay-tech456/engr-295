    "message_1": "What is the magnetic susceptibility of a AlNiCo magnet when subjected to a magnetic field of 1.5 T at a temperature of 300 K? The magnet has a composition of 12% Al, 25% Ni, 13% Co, and 50% Fe. The atomic susceptibility of each metal is given as follows: Al = 3.4 x 10^-5, Ni = 5.7 x 10^-2, Co = 2.2 x 10^-4, and Fe = 2.2 x 10^-5.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic susceptibility of the AlNiCo magnet, we need to calculate the weighted average of the atomic susceptibilities of each metal based on their composition percentages.\n\nMagnetic susceptibility (χ) of AlNiCo magnet = (χ_Al × %Al) + (χ_Ni × %Ni) + (χ_Co × %Co) + (χ_Fe × %Fe)\n\nχ_Al = 3.4 × 10^-5\nχ_Ni = 5.7 × 10^-2\nχ_Co = 2.2 × 10^-4\nχ_Fe = 2.2 × 10^-5\n\n%Al = 12%\n%Ni = 25%\n%Co = 13%\n%Fe = 50%\n\nχ_AlNiCo = (3.4 × 10^-5 × 0.12) + (5.7 × 10^-2 × 0.25) + (2.2 × 10^-4 × 0.13) + (2.2 × 10^-5 × 0.50)\n\nχ_AlNiCo = (4.08 × 10^-6) + (0.01425) + (2.86 × 10^-5) + (1.1 × 10^-5)\n\nχ_AlNiCo ≈ 0.0143\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the AlNiCo magnet when subjected to a magnetic field of 1.5 T at a temperature of 300 K is approximately 0.0143."
