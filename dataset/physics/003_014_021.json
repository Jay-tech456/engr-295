    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of sides 20cm and 10cm carries a current of 5A in the clockwise direction. Determine the magnetic field at a point situated at the center of the loop.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four segments (two sides of length 20 cm and two sides of length 10 cm). We will find the magnetic field contribution from each segment and then add them up to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's consider one of the 20 cm sides first. For this segment, the current element dl and the position vector r are perpendicular to each other. The angle between dl and r is 90°, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(90°) = dl * r\n\nThe distance r from the center of the loop to the middle of the 20 cm side is half of the 10 cm side, which is 5 cm or 0.05 m. The magnetic field contribution from this segment is:\n\ndB₁ = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nNow let's consider one of the 10 cm sides. For this segment, the current element dl and the position vector r are parallel to each other, so the angle between them is 0°. In this case, the cross product is:\n\ndl x r = dl * r * sin(0°) = 0\n\nSince the cross product is zero, this segment does not contribute to the magnetic field at the center of the loop. Therefore, we only need to consider the magnetic field contributions from the two 20 cm sides.\n\nThe total magnetic field at the center of the loop is the sum of the magnetic field contributions from the two 20 cm sides:\n\nB_total = 2 * dB₁\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nB_total = 2 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * r) / r³\n\nB_total = 2 * (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / 4π * (5 A * 0.2 m * 0.05 m) / (0.05 m)³\n\nB_total = (2 × 10⁻⁶ T) * (1 A * 0.2 m) / (0.05 m)²\n\nB_total = (2 × 10⁻⁶ T) * (1 A * 0.2 m) / 0.0025 m²\n\nB_total = 1.6 × 10⁻⁴ T\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 1.6 × 10⁻⁴ T."
