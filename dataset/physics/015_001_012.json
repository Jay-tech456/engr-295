    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * D)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), r is the orbital separation, and D is the distance from the observer to the binary system.\n\nGiven the mass ratio of 3:1, let's denote M1 = 3m and M2 = m. The total mass of the system is M = M1 + M2 = 4m.\n\nTo find the masses of the black holes, we can use the following formula for the orbital period (P) of a binary system:\n\nP^2 = (4 * Ï€^2 * r^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nWe don't have the orbital period (P) given, so we can't find the exact masses of the black holes. However, we can express the amplitude of the gravitational waves in terms of the total mass (M) and the orbital separation (r).\n\nh = (4 * G^2 * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * r * D)\nh = (4 * G^2 * (3m) * m) / (c^4 * r * D)\nh = (12 * G^2 * m^2) / (c^4 * r * D)\n\nNow, let's convert the orbital separation from kilometers to meters:\n\nr = 1000 km = 1000 * 10^3 m = 10^6 m\n\nSubstituting the values of G, c, and r into the formula:\n\nh = (12 * (6.674 x 10^-11)^2 * m^2) / ((3 x 10^8)^4 * 10^6 * D)\n\nh = (12 * (4.46 x 10^-22) * m^2) / (8.1 x 10^25 * D)\n\nh = (5.36 x 10^-21 * m^2) / D\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the binary black hole system depends on the total mass (M) of the system and the distance (D) from the observer. Without these values, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer."
