    "message_2": "To find the total energy produced in the collision, we first need to determine the relative velocity between the two particles using the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 = 0.8c, v2 = -0.6c (negative because it's in the opposite direction), and c is the speed of light.\n\nv = (0.8c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.8c * -0.6c) / c^2)\nv = (0.2c) / (1 + 0.48)\nv = 0.2c / 1.48\nv â‰ˆ 0.1351c\n\nNow, let's find the total energy produced in the collision. We'll assume the particles have the same rest mass m. The energy of each particle can be found using the relativistic energy formula:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nFor the first particle with velocity 0.8c:\n\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2)\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nE1 = mc^2 / sqrt(0.36)\nE1 = mc^2 / 0.6\n\nFor the second particle with velocity 0.6c:\n\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)^2)\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nE2 = mc^2 / sqrt(0.64)\nE2 = mc^2 / 0.8\n\nThe total energy produced in the collision is the sum of the energies of the two particles:\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = (mc^2 / 0.6) + (mc^2 / 0.8)\nE_total = (4/3)mc^2 + (5/4)mc^2\nE_total = (21/12)mc^2\n\nSo, the total energy produced in the collision is (21/12)mc^2."
