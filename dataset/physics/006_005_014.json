    "message_2": "The Lamb shift is a small difference in energy between the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 levels in a hydrogen atom, which arises due to the interaction of the electron with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The Lamb shift correction for the hydrogen atom has been measured experimentally and is approximately 1057.845 MHz.\n\nTo find the energy difference, we can use the formula:\n\nΔE = h * Δν\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and Δν is the frequency difference (1057.845 MHz).\n\nΔE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (1057.845 x 10^6 Hz)\nΔE ≈ 7.016 x 10^-28 J\n\nNow, to find the corresponding wavelength of emission or absorption of a photon that would cause a transition between these levels, we can use the formula:\n\nλ = c * h / ΔE\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), h is the Planck's constant, and ΔE is the energy difference.\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (7.016 x 10^-28 J)\nλ ≈ 2.838 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the corresponding wavelength of emission or absorption of a photon that would cause a transition between the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 levels in a hydrogen atom due to the Lamb shift correction is approximately 283.8 nm."
