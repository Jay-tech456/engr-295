    "message_1": "A physics student wants to calculate the magnetic field due to a straight wire of length 20 cm and carrying a current of 5 A. Determine the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm away from the wire.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field due to a straight wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the wire is straight and we are looking for the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law in the form of the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 5 A (current)\nr = 10 cm = 0.1 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.2π m)\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = 1 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm away from the wire is 1 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
