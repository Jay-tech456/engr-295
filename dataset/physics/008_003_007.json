    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino swapping flavor from electron neutrino to muon neutrino, we need to consider the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, which describes the flavor oscillation of neutrinos in matter. The MSW effect is important when neutrinos travel through matter with a significant density, such as the Earth's crust.\n\nThe probability of a neutrino swapping flavor can be expressed as:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2θ_m) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere θ_m is the mixing angle in matter, Δm² is the difference in the square of the neutrino masses, L is the distance traveled by the neutrino, and E is the energy of the neutrino.\n\nHowever, to calculate the mixing angle in matter (θ_m), we need to know the vacuum mixing angle (θ) and the matter potential (V). The matter potential can be calculated using the density of the matter (ρ) and the electron fraction (Y_e):\n\nV = √2 * G_F * N_e\n\nwhere G_F is the Fermi constant and N_e is the electron number density, which can be calculated as:\n\nN_e = ρ * Y_e * N_A / m_p\n\nwhere N_A is Avogadro's number and m_p is the proton mass.\n\nGiven the complexity of these calculations and the fact that we do not have all the necessary parameters (such as the vacuum mixing angle, the difference in the square of the neutrino masses, and the electron fraction), it is not possible to provide an exact probability for the neutrino flavor swap in this specific scenario.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that neutrino oscillations are a well-established phenomenon, and the probability of a neutrino swapping flavor depends on various factors, including the distance traveled, the energy of the neutrino, and the properties of the matter it passes through."
