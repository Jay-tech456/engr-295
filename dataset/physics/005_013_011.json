    "message_2": "To find the total energy released during the collision, we need to first find the energy of each particle before the collision and then add them together. The energy of a particle can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nGiven that the proton and antiproton have equal mass and collide head-on at a speed of 0.9c, we can find the energy of each particle:\n\nE_proton = E_antiproton = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nE_proton = E_antiproton = m * c^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy:\n\nE_proton = E_antiproton = m * c^2 / sqrt(0.19)\n\nSince the proton and antiproton have the same energy, the total energy released during the collision is the sum of their energies:\n\nE_total = E_proton + E_antiproton = 2 * m * c^2 / sqrt(0.19)\n\nTo find the numerical value of the total energy, we need to know the mass of the proton. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 * 10^(-27) kg. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nE_total = 2 * (1.67 * 10^(-27) kg) * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2 / sqrt(0.19)\nE_total ≈ 2 * (1.67 * 10^(-27) kg) * (9 * 10^16 m^2/s^2) / 0.43589\n\nE_total ≈ 6.956 * 10^(-10) J\n\nSo, the total energy released during the collision is approximately 6.956 * 10^(-10) Joules."
