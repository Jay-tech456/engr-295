    "message_2": "To calculate the impact parameter (b) for alpha particles in the Rutherford scattering experiment, we need to use the formula for Rutherford scattering:\n\nb = (Z₁ * Z₂ * e²) / (4 * π * ε₀ * K * sin(θ/2))\n\nwhere:\n- Z₁ and Z₂ are the atomic numbers of the two interacting particles (for alpha particles and gold, Z₁ = 2 and Z₂ = 79)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^(-19) C)\n- ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²)\n- K is the kinetic energy of the alpha particles\n- θ is the scattering angle (60 degrees in this case)\n\nHowever, we don't have the kinetic energy (K) of the alpha particles provided. The impact parameter (b) cannot be calculated without this information. If you can provide the kinetic energy of the alpha particles, we can proceed with the calculation."
