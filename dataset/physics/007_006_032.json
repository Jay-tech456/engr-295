    "message_2": "To find the scattering angle of neutrons, we can use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the scattered radiation, the lattice spacing, and the scattering angle. Bragg's Law is given by:\n\nnλ = 2d * sin(θ)\n\nwhere n is an integer (the order of the reflection), λ is the wavelength of the scattered radiation, d is the lattice spacing, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nλ = 2.5 Angstroms\nd = 3.1 Angstroms\nincident angle = 30 degrees\n\nSince the incident angle is 30 degrees, the scattering angle will be twice the incident angle (because the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). Therefore, the scattering angle is:\n\n2 * 30 = 60 degrees"
