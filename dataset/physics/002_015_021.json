    "message_1": "A heat pump operates between the temperatures of 10°C and 18°C. If the heat pump consumes 500 J of work and extracts 2000 J of heat from the cold reservoir, determine the coefficient of performance of the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is the ratio of the heat delivered to the hot reservoir to the work input. In this case, the heat pump extracts 2000 J of heat from the cold reservoir and consumes 500 J of work. The total heat delivered to the hot reservoir is the sum of the heat extracted from the cold reservoir and the work input.\n\nHeat delivered to the hot reservoir = Heat extracted from the cold reservoir + Work input\nQ_hot = Q_cold + W\nQ_hot = 2000 J + 500 J\nQ_hot = 2500 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) using the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_hot / W\nCOP = 2500 J / 500 J\nCOP = 5\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the heat pump is 5."
