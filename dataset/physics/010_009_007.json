    "message_1": "A fuel tank has a small hole at its bottom. The tank is 6 meters tall and contains gasoline with a specific gravity of 0.8. If the hole has a diameter of 0.5 cm, determine the speed of the gasoline as it exits the hole.",
    "message_2": "To determine the speed of the gasoline as it exits the hole, we can use Torricelli's theorem, which relates the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice to the height of fluid above the orifice and the acceleration due to gravity. The theorem states that:\n\nv = √(2gh)\n\nwhere:\nv = speed of the fluid exiting the hole\ng = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nh = height of the fluid above the hole\n\nIn this case, the height of the fluid above the hole is equal to the height of the tank, which is 6 meters. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the gasoline as it exits the hole:\n\nv = √(2 * 9.81 m/s² * 6 m)\nv ≈ √(117.72 m²/s²)\nv ≈ 10.85 m/s\n\nThe speed of the gasoline as it exits the hole is approximately 10.85 meters per second."
