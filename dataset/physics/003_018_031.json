    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the solenoid, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a solenoid:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the solenoid. Since the solenoid is uniformly wound, we can assume that the turns are evenly distributed along the length. Let's denote the length of the solenoid as L. Then, the number of turns per unit length (n) can be calculated as:\n\nn = N / L\n\nwhere N is the total number of turns (8000).\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field at a point 4 cm away from the center. To do this, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at a point on the axis of a solenoid:\n\nB = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * L) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the point on the axis and the end of the solenoid.\n\nWe can find θ using the right triangle formed by the radius of the solenoid (2.5 cm), the distance from the center (4 cm), and the length of the solenoid (L). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nL^2 = 4^2 + 2.5^2\nL^2 = 16 + 6.25\nL^2 = 22.25\nL = √22.25 ≈ 4.72 cm\n\nNow we can calculate the number of turns per unit length (n):\n\nn = 8000 / 4.72 ≈ 1694.92 turns/cm\n\nNext, we can find the angle θ using the cosine rule:\n\ncos(θ) = (4^2 + 4.72^2 - 2.5^2) / (2 * 4 * 4.72) ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field at the point 4 cm away from the center:\n\nB = (4π x 10^(-7) Tm/A * 1694.92 turns/cm * 0.2 A) / (2 * 4.72 cm) * (1 - 0.7071)\nB ≈ (3.36 x 10^(-4) T * 339.0) * 0.2929\nB ≈ 1.14 x 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 4 cm away from the center of the solenoid is approximately 1.14 x 10^(-4) T (Tesla)."
