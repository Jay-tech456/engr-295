    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm (0.1 m) from a straight wire with a current of 5 A flowing through it, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a straight wire, which is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current flowing through the wire (5 A), and r is the distance from the wire (0.1 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) T·m/A) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 100 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB = 10 × 10^(-6) T\n\nB = 10 μT\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm from the straight wire is 10 μT (microteslas)."
