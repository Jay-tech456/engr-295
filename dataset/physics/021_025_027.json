    "message_2": "The likelihood of black holes born from the collapse of massive stars being the source of primordial black holes is currently considered to be low. Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. They are different from the black holes formed by the collapse of massive stars, which are known as stellar black holes.\n\nPrimordial black holes are theorized to have formed from density fluctuations in the early universe. If regions of the universe had a high enough density, they could have collapsed under their own gravity to form black holes. These black holes would have a wide range of masses, depending on the size of the density fluctuations.\n\nOn the other hand, stellar black holes form when massive stars reach the end of their life cycle and undergo a supernova explosion. The core of the star collapses under its own gravity, forming a black hole. These black holes typically have masses between 5 and 50 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nThe main reason why stellar black holes are not considered to be the source of primordial black holes is the difference in their formation mechanisms and the time at which they formed. Stellar black holes form much later in the history of the universe, as stars evolve and die, while primordial black holes would have formed in the very early universe.\n\nIf a link between stellar black holes and primordial black holes were to be discovered, it would have significant implications for our understanding of the universe's origins and evolution. It would mean that our current understanding of black hole formation and the early universe would need to be revised. Additionally, it could potentially provide new insights into the nature of dark matter, as some theories suggest that primordial black holes could be a candidate for dark matter.\n\nHowever, as of now, there is no strong evidence to suggest that stellar black holes are the source of primordial black holes. Observations and theoretical studies continue to explore the nature and existence of primordial black holes, and any potential connections to other types of black holes."
