    "message_2": "The magnetic properties of materials like Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni) are strongly influenced by temperature. These materials are ferromagnetic, meaning they have a spontaneous magnetization below a certain critical temperature called the Curie temperature (Tc). Above the Curie temperature, these materials become paramagnetic, losing their spontaneous magnetization.\n\nThe Curie temperature is a critical point where the ferromagnetic materials undergo a phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic behavior. The magnetization (M) and magnetic susceptibility (χ) of these materials change significantly as a function of temperature.\n\nFor Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), the Curie temperatures are as follows:\n\n- Iron (Fe): Tc ≈ 770°C (1043 K)\n- Nickel (Ni): Tc ≈ 358°C (631 K)\n\nAs the temperature increases, the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments of the atoms to become more randomly oriented, reducing the net magnetization of the material. Below the Curie temperature, the magnetization decreases with increasing temperature, following the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nM(T) = M(0) * (1 - T/Tc)^β\n\nwhere M(T) is the magnetization at temperature T, M(0) is the magnetization at 0 K, Tc is the Curie temperature, and β is a critical exponent (usually close to 0.5 for ferromagnetic materials).\n\nAbove the Curie temperature, the materials become paramagnetic, and their magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nχ(T) = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ(T) is the magnetic susceptibility at temperature T, C is the Curie constant, and Tc is the Curie temperature.\n\nIn summary, as the temperature increases, the magnetization of Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni) decreases, and their magnetic susceptibility changes from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic behavior. The Curie temperatures for Iron and Nickel are 770°C (1043 K) and 358°C (631 K), respectively, which are the critical points where these materials undergo a phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic behavior."
