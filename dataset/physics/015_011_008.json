    "message_2": "Estimating the number of gravitational wave detections by future observatories depends on several factors, including the sensitivity of the instruments, the types of sources being observed, and the duration of the observation period. To provide a rough estimate, we can consider the current detection rate of the LIGO and Virgo observatories and extrapolate based on the expected improvements in sensitivity for future observatories.\n\nAs of October 2021, the LIGO and Virgo observatories have detected over 90 gravitational wave events since their first detection in September 2015. The majority of these detections are from binary black hole mergers, with a few from binary neutron star mergers and one from a black hole-neutron star merger. The current detection rate is roughly 30-40 events per year.\n\nFuture observatories, such as the planned LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) and Einstein Telescope, are expected to have significantly improved sensitivity compared to LIGO and Virgo. LISA, for example, will be sensitive to lower-frequency gravitational waves, allowing it to detect events such as the mergers of supermassive black holes and the inspiral of compact objects into supermassive black holes. The Einstein Telescope will have a sensitivity about ten times better than LIGO and Virgo, enabling it to detect a larger number of events and observe them at greater distances.\n\nConsidering these improvements in sensitivity, it is reasonable to expect that future observatories could detect hundreds to thousands of gravitational wave events per year. However, this estimate is subject to uncertainties in the actual sensitivity of the instruments, the distribution of sources in the universe, and the duration of the observation period.\n\nIn summary, based on current knowledge of sources and expected sensitivity of future instruments, we can estimate that future observatories could detect hundreds to thousands of gravitational wave events per year. However, this estimate is subject to uncertainties and should be taken as a rough approximation."
