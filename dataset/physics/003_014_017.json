    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the loop is rectangular, we can divide it into four segments, each corresponding to one side of the rectangle. Let's label the sides as follows: side 1 (length a, parallel to the x-axis), side 2 (length b, parallel to the y-axis), side 3 (length a, parallel to the x-axis), and side 4 (length b, parallel to the y-axis).\n\nFor each segment, we can integrate the magnetic field contribution over the entire length of the side. Due to symmetry, the magnetic field contributions from side 1 and side 3 will cancel each other out, as will the contributions from side 2 and side 4. Therefore, we only need to calculate the magnetic field due to one of the sides (e.g., side 1) and multiply it by 2.\n\nLet's consider side 1, which is parallel to the x-axis and has a length of a. The differential length vector dl for this side is given by:\n\ndl = dx * x-hat\n\nwhere dx is the differential length along the x-axis, and x-hat is the unit vector in the x-direction.\n\nThe position vector r from the current element on side 1 to the point of interest on the z-axis is given by:\n\nr = x * x-hat + z * z-hat\n\nwhere x is the distance along the x-axis from the center of the loop to the current element, and z is the distance from the center of the loop to the point of interest along the z-axis.\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (dx * x-hat) x (x * x-hat + z * z-hat)\n\nThe x component of the cross product will be zero, and the z component will be:\n\n(dl x r)_z = dx * x * (-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute this result into the Biot-Savart Law and integrate over the length of side 1:\n\nB_z = 2 * ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * (-dx * x) / (x² + z²)^(3/2)) from x = -a/2 to x = a/2\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 2π) * ∫(x * dx / (x² + z²)^(3/2)) from x = -a/2 to x = a/2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nu = x² + z²\ndu = 2x * dx\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 4πz³) * ∫(u * du / u^(3/2)) from u = (a/2)² + z² to u = (-a/2)² + z²\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 4πz³) * ∫(u^(1/2) * du) from u = (a/2)² + z² to u = (-a/2)² + z²\n\nNow, we can integrate and evaluate the limits:\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 4πz³) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) from u = (a/2)² + z² to u = (-a/2)² + z²\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 6πz³) * (((a/2)² + z²)^(3/2) - ((-a/2)² + z²)^(3/2))\n\nSince the limits are the same, the result is:\n\nB_z = (-μ₀ * I / 6πz³) * (a² + 4z²)^(3/2)\n\nThis is the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the rectangular loop, a distance 'z' away from the center of the loop."
