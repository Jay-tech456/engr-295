    "message_2": "Dark matter, a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and is therefore invisible to telescopes, has a significant effect on gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters. Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, bends the path of light from a background object, such as a more distant galaxy. This bending of light is due to the gravitational influence of the massive object, which distorts the spacetime around it according to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nBoth dark matter and visible (baryonic) matter contribute to the total mass of a galaxy cluster, and thus both have an effect on gravitational lensing. However, dark matter is believed to make up around 85% of the total matter in the universe, so its contribution to the lensing effect is much more significant than that of visible matter.\n\nTo distinguish the lensing caused by dark matter from that caused by visible matter, astronomers use a technique called \"weak lensing.\" Weak lensing involves analyzing the subtle distortions in the shapes of background galaxies due to the gravitational influence of the foreground galaxy cluster. By studying these distortions, astronomers can create a map of the mass distribution within the galaxy cluster, including both visible and dark matter.\n\nTo separate the contributions of dark matter and visible matter, astronomers compare the mass distribution map obtained from weak lensing with the distribution of visible matter, such as stars and gas, observed through telescopes. The difference between the two distributions can be attributed to the presence of dark matter.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters is typically more extended and diffuse than that of visible matter, which tends to be concentrated in the central regions of the cluster. This difference in distribution can also help distinguish the lensing effects of dark matter from those of visible matter.\n\nIn summary, dark matter has a significant effect on gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, and its influence can be distinguished from that of visible matter by analyzing the weak lensing signal and comparing the mass distribution maps with the distribution of visible matter."
