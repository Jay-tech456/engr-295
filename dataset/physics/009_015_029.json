    "message_2": "To determine the location and size of the image formed by a concave mirror, we can use the mirror equation and magnification equation. The mirror equation is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification equation is given by:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nwhere M is the magnification, di is the image distance, and do is the object distance.\n\nFirst, we need to find the focal length (f) of the mirror. The radius of curvature (R) is given as 20 cm. The relationship between the radius of curvature and the focal length is:\n\nf = R/2\n\nSo, the focal length is:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror equation to find the image distance (di). The object distance (do) is given as 30 cm. Plugging these values into the mirror equation:\n\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(3 + 1/di) / 30 = 1/10\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n3 + 1/di = 10\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1/di = 7\n\nTake the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = 1/7\n\nSo, the image distance (di) is approximately 14.29 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification (M) using the magnification equation:\n\nM = -di/do = -14.29 cm / 30 cm = -0.476\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nNow, let's consider the spherical aberration of 2 cm. Spherical aberration causes the image to be slightly distorted, but it does not significantly affect the location and size of the image. Therefore, the image is formed approximately 14.29 cm in front of the mirror, and the magnification is -0.476, meaning the image is inverted and approximately 47.6% of the size of the object."
