    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (dB) due to a small current element (Idl) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (Idl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), r is the distance from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a square loop, we can divide the loop into four equal segments and calculate the magnetic field due to one segment, then multiply the result by 4 since the magnetic field contributions from all four segments are symmetrical.\n\nLet's consider one segment of the square loop. The current element Idl can be represented as:\n\nIdl = I * ds\n\nwhere I is the current (3 A) and ds is a small length along the segment.\n\nThe distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of the segment is half the side length, which is 0.25 meters. The angle between the current element and the position vector r is 45 degrees, as the magnetic field is being calculated at the center of the square.\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to one segment:\n\ndB_segment = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(Idl x r) / r³\n\nSince the angle between Idl and r is 45 degrees, the cross product can be simplified to:\n\nIdl x r = |Idl| * |r| * sin(45)\n\nIntegrating over the length of the segment (from 0 to 0.5 meters) and multiplying by 4 to account for all segments, we get:\n\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(I * ds * r * sin(45)) / r³\n\nThe current I, distance r, and sin(45) are constants, so we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB_total = 4 * (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * r * sin(45)) * ∫(ds / r³)\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I * r * sin(45)) * ∫(ds / r³)\n\nNow, we can integrate ds from 0 to 0.5 meters:\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I * r * sin(45)) * [s / r³] (from 0 to 0.5)\n\nB_total = (μ₀ * I * r * sin(45)) * (0.5 / r³)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB_total = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 3 A * 0.25 m * sin(45)) * (0.5 / 0.25³)\n\nB_total ≈ (3.77 × 10⁻⁷ T * 0.25 * 0.707) * (0.5 / 0.015625)\n\nB_total ≈ (6.66 × 10⁻⁸ T) * (0.5 / 0.015625)\n\nB_total ≈ 2.14 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the square loop is approximately 2.14 × 10⁻⁶ T (Tesla)."
