    "message_2": "Topological insulators are materials that have unique electronic properties: they are insulating in their bulk but have conducting surface states. These surface states are topologically protected, meaning they are robust against local perturbations and impurities. This property makes topological insulators promising candidates for creating protected qubits in quantum computing.\n\nIn quantum computing, qubits are the basic units of quantum information, analogous to classical bits in classical computing. However, qubits are extremely sensitive to their environment, and any interaction with the surroundings can cause errors, leading to a loss of quantum information. This phenomenon is called decoherence. To build a practical quantum computer, it is crucial to develop qubits that are resistant to decoherence.\n\nTopological insulators can be used to create protected qubits through a phenomenon called Majorana fermions. Majorana fermions are special quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and obey non-Abelian statistics. They can emerge at the boundary between a topological insulator and a superconductor, forming so-called Majorana zero modes.\n\nThese Majorana zero modes can be used to encode qubits in a topologically protected manner. The quantum information is stored non-locally, meaning it is distributed across multiple Majorana fermions. This non-locality makes the qubits robust against local perturbations and decoherence, as any local disturbance would not affect the overall quantum state.\n\nTo perform quantum operations on these topologically protected qubits, one can manipulate the Majorana fermions by braiding them around each other. This process is called braiding, and it allows for the execution of quantum gates in a fault-tolerant manner. Since the quantum information is stored non-locally, the braiding process does not introduce errors, making the qubits highly resistant to decoherence.\n\nIn summary, topological insulators can be used in quantum computing to create protected qubits by exploiting the unique properties of Majorana fermions. These qubits are resistant to decoherence due to their non-locality and topological protection, making them promising candidates for building fault-tolerant quantum computers."
