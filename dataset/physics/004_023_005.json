    "message_2": "The expected gravitational wave signal and energy emission from a black hole merger can be estimated using the formulas derived from general relativity and numerical simulations. For a black hole merger with masses of 30 and 50 solar masses (M1 = 30 M_sun and M2 = 50 M_sun), we can first calculate the total mass (M_total) and the reduced mass (M_reduced):\n\nM_total = M1 + M2 = 30 M_sun + 50 M_sun = 80 M_sun\nM_reduced = (M1 * M2) / M_total = (30 M_sun * 50 M_sun) / 80 M_sun ≈ 18.75 M_sun\n\nThe energy emitted in gravitational waves (E_GW) during the merger can be estimated as a fraction of the reduced mass times the speed of light squared (c^2):\n\nE_GW ≈ 0.1 * M_reduced * c^2 ≈ 0.1 * 18.75 M_sun * c^2\n\nThis is approximately 1.875 solar masses (M_sun) converted into gravitational wave energy.\n\nThe gravitational wave signal strength, or strain amplitude (h), depends on the distance from Earth (D) and can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nh ≈ (4 * G * E_GW) / (c^4 * D)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nAs the distance from Earth increases, the strain amplitude (h) decreases, making the gravitational wave signal weaker. This means that the farther away the black hole merger is, the more difficult it will be to detect the gravitational waves produced by the event. Detection of such signals is done by observatories like LIGO and Virgo, which are sensitive to strain amplitudes on the order of 10^-21 to 10^-22."
