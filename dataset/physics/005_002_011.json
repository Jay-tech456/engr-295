    "message_2": "To find the length of the rod as observed by the observer, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The formula for length contraction is:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (length of the rod in its rest frame, which is 1 meter in this case), v is the relative velocity (0.6c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nL = 1 * sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nL = sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nL = sqrt(0.64)\nL = 0.8 meters\n\nSo, the length of the 1-meter long rod moving at 0.6c in the rest frame of an observer is 0.8 meters."
