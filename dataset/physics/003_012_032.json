    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire has dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters and carries a current of 5 amps. Determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop if the loop is lying flat on a table.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I) divided by the length of the loop (2πr).\n\nHowever, since we have a rectangular loop, we need to break it down into four segments and calculate the magnetic field due to each segment at the center of the loop. Then, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center.\n\nLet's label the four segments as follows:\n1. Top segment (length = 0.4 m)\n2. Bottom segment (length = 0.4 m)\n3. Left segment (length = 0.3 m)\n4. Right segment (length = 0.3 m)\n\nFor each segment, we can calculate the magnetic field at the center using the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current (5 A), and r is the distance from the wire to the center of the loop.\n\nFor the top and bottom segments, the distance r is half of the height (0.3 m / 2 = 0.15 m). For the left and right segments, the distance r is half of the width (0.4 m / 2 = 0.2 m).\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field due to each segment:\n\n1. Top segment:\nB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.15 m) = 5 × 10^(-7) T\n\n2. Bottom segment:\nB₂ = B₁ (due to symmetry) = 5 × 10^(-7) T\n\n3. Left segment:\nB₃ = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 5 A) / (4 * π * 0.2 m) = 2.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\n4. Right segment:\nB₄ = B₃ (due to symmetry) = 2.5 × 10^(-7) T\n\nNow, we can sum up the magnetic fields due to each segment to find the total magnetic field at the center:\n\nB_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ + B₄ = 5 × 10^(-7) T + 5 × 10^(-7) T + 2.5 × 10^(-7) T + 2.5 × 10^(-7) T = 15 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop is 15 × 10^(-7) T or 1.5 × 10^(-6) T."
