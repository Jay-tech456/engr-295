    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc, we can use the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc, we need to consider a small current element dI over a small area dA of the disc.\n\nLet's consider a small ring of radius r and thickness dr on the disc. The area of this ring is dA = 2πr dr. The current density J (current per unit area) is given by J = I / (πR^2). So, the current in the small ring is dI = J dA = (I / (πR^2)) * 2πr dr.\n\nNow, let's apply the Biot-Savart Law to find the magnetic field dB due to this small current element dI at a point on the axis of the disc at a distance z from its center. The Biot-Savart Law states:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl) x r' / |r'|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, dl is the length element along the current, r' is the vector from the current element to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor our problem, dl is a small segment of the circumference of the ring, and r' is the vector from the ring to the point on the axis. The angle between dl and r' is 90 degrees, so the cross product simplifies to:\n\ndl x r' = dl * r' * sin(90) = dl * r'\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r') / (r'^2 + z^2)^(3/2)\n\nSince we are interested in the magnetic field along the axis, we only need the z-component of dB. Due to symmetry, the x and y components will cancel out. The z-component of dB is:\n\ndBz = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * dl * r' * z) / (r'^2 + z^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate dBz over the entire disc to find the total magnetic field Bz. We will integrate over the length dl around the circumference of the ring and then integrate over the radius r of the disc:\n\nBz = ∫∫ dBz\n\nFirst, let's integrate over the length dl around the circumference of the ring:\n\nBz_ring = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * r' * z) / (r'^2 + z^2)^(3/2) dl\n\nSince dI, r', and z are constants with respect to dl, we can pull them out of the integral:\n\nBz_ring = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * r' * z) / (r'^2 + z^2)^(3/2) * ∫ dl\n\nThe integral of dl around the circumference of the ring is simply the circumference 2πr':\n\nBz_ring = (μ₀ / 4π) * (dI * r' * z) / (r'^2 + z^2)^(3/2) * 2πr'\n\nNow, we need to integrate Bz_ring over the radius r of the disc:\n\nBz = ∫ Bz_ring dr\n\nSubstitute dI = (I / (πR^2)) * 2πr dr and r' = r:\n\nBz = ∫ (μ₀ / 4π) * ((I / (πR^2)) * 2πr * r * z) / (r^2 + z^2)^(3/2) * 2πr dr\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / R^2 * ∫ (r^2 * z) / (r^2 + z^2)^(3/2) dr\n\nIntegrate over the limits r = 0 to r = R:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I) / R^2 * [z * (1 - (z^2 / (R^2 + z^2))^(1/2))]\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the disc at a distance z from its center is:\n\nBz = (μ₀ * I * z) / (2 * R^2) * (1 - (z^2 / (R^2 + z^2))^(1/2))"
