    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Torricelli's Law and the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity of water flow through the hole using Torricelli's Law:\n\nv = √(2gh)\n\nwhere:\nv = velocity of water flow\ng = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nh = height of water in the tank (6 m)\n\nv = √(2 × 9.81 m/s² × 6 m)\nv ≈ √(117.72 m²/s²)\nv ≈ 10.85 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the time taken to empty the tank completely. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of mass. The volume of water flowing out of the hole per second is equal to the product of the hole's area and the velocity of water flow:\n\nQ = Av\n\nwhere:\nQ = volume flow rate (m³/s)\nA = area of the hole (m²)\nv = velocity of water flow (10.85 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the diameter of the hole to meters:\n\nd = 0.1 cm = 0.001 m\n\nNow, we can find the area of the hole:\n\nA = π(d/2)²\nA = π(0.001 m/2)²\nA ≈ 7.854 × 10⁻⁶ m²\n\nNow, we can find the volume flow rate:\n\nQ = Av\nQ ≈ 7.854 × 10⁻⁶ m² × 10.85 m/s\nQ ≈ 8.52 × 10⁻⁵ m³/s\n\nNow, we can find the time taken to empty the tank completely. The volume of water in the tank is:\n\nV = Ah\n\nwhere:\nV = volume of water in the tank (m³)\nA = area of the tank's base (m²)\nh = height of water in the tank (6 m)\n\nAssuming the tank has a square base, we can find the area of the tank's base by dividing the volume of water in the tank by the height of water:\n\nA = V/h\n\nSince we don't know the area of the tank's base, we can't find the exact time taken to empty the tank. However, we can find the time taken to empty the tank in terms of the area of the tank's base:\n\nt = V/Q\n\nwhere:\nt = time taken to empty the tank (s)\nV = volume of water in the tank (m³)\nQ = volume flow rate (8.52 × 10⁻⁵ m³/s)\n\nt = (Ah)/Q\nt = (A × 6 m)/(8.52 × 10⁻⁵ m³/s)\n\nSo, the time taken to empty the tank completely is:\n\nt = (6A)/(8.52 × 10⁻⁵) seconds"
