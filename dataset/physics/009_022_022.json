    "message_1": "What is the angle of incidence for a beam of unpolarized light that is reflected off a glass surface at an angle of 57 degrees with respect to the normal, if the reflected light is completely polarized according to Brewster's Law and the index of refraction of the glass surface is 1.5?",
    "message_2": "Brewster's Law states that when light is reflected off a surface at an angle equal to the polarizing angle (also known as Brewster's angle), the reflected light is completely polarized. The polarizing angle can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ntan(θ_p) = n₂ / n₁\n\nwhere θ_p is the polarizing angle (Brewster's angle), n₁ is the index of refraction of the first medium (air in this case, with n₁ = 1), and n₂ is the index of refraction of the second medium (glass in this case, with n₂ = 1.5).\n\nFirst, let's find the polarizing angle θ_p:\n\ntan(θ_p) = 1.5 / 1\nθ_p = arctan(1.5)\n\nθ_p ≈ 56.31 degrees\n\nNow, we know that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence (according to the Law of Reflection). Since the reflected light is completely polarized, the angle of incidence must be equal to the polarizing angle:\n\nAngle of incidence = θ_p ≈ 56.31 degrees"
