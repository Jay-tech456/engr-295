    "message_1": "What is the Hall coefficient of a semiconducting material with electron concentration of 5x10^20 m^-3 and a mobility of 650 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1, when it is placed in a magnetic field of 0.5 T and a current density of 3 A/m^2 is applied perpendicular to the magnetic field direction?",
    "message_2": "The Hall coefficient (R_H) is a property of a material that relates the Hall voltage, current density, and magnetic field. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR_H = -1 / (q * n)\n\nwhere q is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C) and n is the electron concentration (5 x 10^20 m^-3).\n\nR_H = -1 / (1.6 x 10^-19 C * 5 x 10^20 m^-3)\nR_H â‰ˆ -1.25 x 10^-11 m^3/C\n\nThe Hall coefficient of the semiconducting material is approximately -1.25 x 10^-11 m^3/C."
