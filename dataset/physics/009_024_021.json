    "message_2": "To calculate the intensity of the light beam transmitted through the polarizer, we can use Malus' law. Malus' law states that the intensity of the transmitted light (I_t) is equal to the initial intensity (I_i) multiplied by the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarization direction of the light and the transmission axis of the polarizer (θ).\n\nMathematically, Malus' law is given by:\n\nI_t = I_i * cos²(θ)\n\nIn this case, the initial intensity (I_i) is 10 mW/cm² and the angle (θ) is 45°. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45° * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can use Malus' law to calculate the transmitted intensity:\n\nI_t = 10 mW/cm² * cos²(π/4)\nI_t = 10 mW/cm² * (1/√2)²\nI_t = 10 mW/cm² * 1/2\nI_t = 5 mW/cm²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light beam transmitted through the polarizer is 5 mW/cm²."
