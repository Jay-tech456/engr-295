    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\nΔU = Q - W\n\nIn this case, we are given the heat added to the gas (Q = 500 J) and the work done on the gas (W = -300 J, since work is done on the gas, not by the gas). We can now calculate the change in internal energy:\n\nΔU = 500 J - (-300 J) = 800 J\n\nNow, since the process is isobaric (constant pressure), we can use the following relation for an ideal gas:\n\nΔU = n * Cv * ΔT\n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the gas, Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the final volume using this relation.\n\nInstead, we can use the work done on the gas during the isobaric process:\n\nW = P * ΔV\n\nwhere P is the pressure and ΔV is the change in volume. We know that W = -300 J, but we don't have the pressure. However, we can use the ideal gas law to relate the pressure, volume, and temperature:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant. Since the process is isobaric, the ratio of the initial and final volumes is equal to the ratio of the initial and final temperatures:\n\nV1 / V2 = T1 / T2\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the final volume:\n\nV2 = V1 * (T2 / T1)\n\nNow, we can use the change in internal energy to find the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = ΔU / (n * Cv)\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the final volume directly. We would need more information about the gas, such as the number of moles, the molar heat capacity at constant volume, or the pressure."
