    "message_2": "The predicted range of mass for sterile neutrinos to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the universe is typically between 1 keV and 10 keV. This range is based on theoretical models and simulations that attempt to explain the observed properties of dark matter, such as its distribution in galaxies and its effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nCurrent observational limits on the sterile neutrino mass come from a variety of sources, including X-ray observations of galaxy clusters, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. These observations have not yet provided definitive evidence for the existence of sterile neutrinos, but they have placed constraints on their possible properties.\n\nThe most stringent constraints come from X-ray observations, which search for a specific X-ray emission line that would be produced by the decay of sterile neutrinos. So far, these observations have not detected the expected emission line, which has led to upper limits on the sterile neutrino mass of around 7 keV.\n\nOther constraints come from the cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure observations, which are sensitive to the effects of sterile neutrinos on the distribution of matter in the universe. These observations have placed lower limits on the sterile neutrino mass of around 1 keV.\n\nIn summary, the predicted range of mass for sterile neutrinos to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the universe is between 1 keV and 10 keV, with current observational limits constraining the mass to be below 7 keV. Further observations and experiments are needed to either confirm or rule out the existence of sterile neutrinos as a dark matter candidate."
