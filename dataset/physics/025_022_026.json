    "message_2": "To determine the force required to separate a mitotic spindle during cell division, we first need to know the number of microtubules in the spindle. Unfortunately, the information provided does not give us the number of microtubules in the spindle. \n\nHowever, if we assume that we know the number of microtubules (let's call it \"n\"), we can calculate the total force generated by all the microtubules in the spindle. Since each microtubule generates a force of 500 picoNewtons, the total force (F_total) can be calculated as follows:\n\nF_total = n * 500 picoNewtons\n\nOnce we have the value of \"n,\" we can plug it into the equation to find the total force required to separate the mitotic spindle during cell division."
