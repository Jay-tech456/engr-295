    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at 0.8c towards a planet emitting radio signals at a frequency of 2 GHz. If the speed of light in space is 3x10^8 m/s, what frequency will the spaceship crew hear on their radios? (Assuming no source of error)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for electromagnetic waves, which is:\n\nf_observed = f_source * (c + v_relative) / c\n\nwhere f_observed is the frequency observed by the spaceship crew, f_source is the frequency of the radio signals emitted by the planet (2 GHz), c is the speed of light (3x10^8 m/s), and v_relative is the relative velocity of the spaceship towards the planet (0.8c).\n\nFirst, we need to find the relative velocity in m/s:\n\nv_relative = 0.8 * c = 0.8 * 3x10^8 m/s = 2.4x10^8 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf_observed = 2 GHz * (3x10^8 m/s + 2.4x10^8 m/s) / (3x10^8 m/s)\nf_observed = 2 GHz * (5.4x10^8 m/s) / (3x10^8 m/s)\nf_observed = 2 GHz * 1.8\n\nf_observed = 3.6 GHz\n\nSo, the spaceship crew will hear the radio signals at a frequency of 3.6 GHz."
