    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the new focal length of the lens when it is placed in water. We can use the lensmaker's equation for this purpose:\n\n1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n_lens is the refractive index of the lens, n_medium is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (water in this case), and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.\n\nWe are not given the refractive index of the lens or the radii of curvature, but we can still find the ratio of the focal lengths in air and water:\n\nf_water / f_air = (n_lens/n_water - 1) / (n_lens/n_air - 1)\n\nWe know that f_air = 20 cm and n_water = 1.33. We can assume that the refractive index of the lens is greater than that of water, so the lens still converges light in water. Let's denote the ratio of the refractive indices as k = n_lens/n_air. Then the equation becomes:\n\nf_water / 20 cm = (k/1.33 - 1) / (k - 1)\n\nWe cannot solve for f_water without knowing the value of k, but we can still find the position of the image formed using the lens formula:\n\n1/f_water = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere u is the object distance (30 cm) and v is the image distance. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nv = (u * f_water) / (u - f_water)\n\nSubstituting the expression for f_water from the previous equation, we get:\n\nv = (30 cm * 20 cm) / (30 cm - 20 cm * (k/1.33 - 1) / (k - 1))\n\nThis equation shows that the image distance v depends on the ratio of the refractive indices k. Without knowing the refractive index of the lens, we cannot find the exact position of the image formed. However, we can see that the image distance will be different from the case when the lens is in air."
