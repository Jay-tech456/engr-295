    "message_1": "A camera lens has a focal length of 50 mm and a refractive index of 1.5. It is made up of two lenses, one with a convex surface and the other with a concave surface. The lenses have radii of curvature of 75 mm and 100 mm, respectively. What is the chromatic aberration of the lens system when white light is used?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the chromatic aberration of the lens system, we first need to find the focal lengths of the individual lenses for different wavelengths of light. Chromatic aberration occurs because the refractive index of a material varies with the wavelength of light. In this case, we will consider the refractive indices for the blue (F) and red (C) ends of the visible spectrum.\n\nLet's assume the refractive index for the blue end (F) is 1.52 and for the red end (C) is 1.48. We can use the lens maker's formula to find the focal lengths of the individual lenses for both wavelengths:\n\nLens maker's formula: 1/f = (n-1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nFor the convex lens (R1 = 75 mm, R2 = -75 mm):\n1/f_blue_convex = (1.52-1) * (1/75 - 1/-75)\n1/f_red_convex = (1.48-1) * (1/75 - 1/-75)\n\nFor the concave lens (R1 = -100 mm, R2 = 100 mm):\n1/f_blue_concave = (1.52-1) * (1/-100 - 1/100)\n1/f_red_concave = (1.48-1) * (1/-100 - 1/100)\n\nNow, we can calculate the focal lengths for both lenses and both wavelengths:\n\nf_blue_convex = 1 / (0.52 * (2/75)) = 143.27 mm\nf_red_convex = 1 / (0.48 * (2/75)) = 156.25 mm\n\nf_blue_concave = 1 / (0.52 * (-2/100)) = -192.31 mm\nf_red_concave = 1 / (0.48 * (-2/100)) = -208.33 mm\n\nNext, we can find the combined focal lengths for blue and red light using the formula for thin lenses in contact:\n\n1/f_blue_combined = 1/f_blue_convex + 1/f_blue_concave\n1/f_red_combined = 1/f_red_convex + 1/f_red_concave\n\nf_blue_combined = 1 / (1/143.27 + 1/-192.31) = 82.76 mm\nf_red_combined = 1 / (1/156.25 + 1/-208.33) = 89.29 mm\n\nFinally, we can calculate the chromatic aberration, which is the difference in focal lengths for blue and red light:\n\nChromatic aberration = f_red_combined - f_blue_combined = 89.29 mm - 82.76 mm = 6.53 mm\n\nThe chromatic aberration of the lens system when white light is used is 6.53 mm."
