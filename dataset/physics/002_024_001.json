    "message_1": "\"Calculate the heat of vaporization of substance X at a given temperature using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, given that the vapor pressure of X at 100°C is 450 mmHg and at 150°C is 790 mmHg. The boiling point of X is 120°C.\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the heat of vaporization of substance X, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).\n\nFirst, let's convert the given temperatures and pressures to the appropriate units:\n\nT1 = 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K\nT2 = 150°C + 273.15 = 423.15 K\nP1 = 450 mmHg * (101.325 kPa / 760 mmHg) = 60.056 kPa\nP2 = 790 mmHg * (101.325 kPa / 760 mmHg) = 105.914 kPa\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(105.914/60.056) = (ΔHvap/8.314) * (1/373.15 - 1/423.15)\n\n0.564 = (ΔHvap/8.314) * (-0.000294)\n\nNow, we can solve for ΔHvap:\n\nΔHvap = 0.564 * 8.314 / (-0.000294) = -16053.5 J/mol\n\nSince the heat of vaporization is usually expressed in kJ/mol, we can convert it:\n\nΔHvap = -16.053 kJ/mol\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat of vaporization is an endothermic process, which is expected for vaporization. Therefore, the heat of vaporization of substance X at the given temperature is 16.053 kJ/mol."
