    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm away from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. In this case, we will use Ampere's Law, which is more straightforward for a straight wire.\n\nAmpere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire (5 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm or 0.05 m).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.05 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm away from the wire is 2 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
