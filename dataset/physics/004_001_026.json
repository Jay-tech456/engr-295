    "message_2": "To estimate the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Amplitude (strain): h ~ (4 * G * M * c^(-2)) / r\n2. Frequency: f ~ c^3 / (G * M)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system, c is the speed of light, and r is the distance from the source.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes to kilograms:\n10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n20 solar masses = 20 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 3.978 x 10^31 kg\n\nThe total mass of the system is M = 1.989 x 10^31 kg + 3.978 x 10^31 kg = 5.967 x 10^31 kg.\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance to meters:\n1 billion light years = 1 x 10^9 * 9.461 x 10^15 m = 9.461 x 10^24 m\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude (strain) of the gravitational waves:\nh ~ (4 * 6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 5.967 x 10^31 kg * (3 x 10^8 m/s)^(-2)) / (9.461 x 10^24 m)\nh ~ 1.3 x 10^(-22)\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves can be calculated as:\nf ~ (3 x 10^8 m/s)^3 / (6.674 x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) * 5.967 x 10^31 kg)\nf ~ 63.5 Hz\n\nSo, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves is approximately 1.3 x 10^(-22), and the frequency is approximately 63.5 Hz.\n\nThe best type of gravitational wave detector for detecting these waves is a ground-based interferometric detector, such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) or Virgo. These detectors are sensitive to gravitational waves in the frequency range of 10 Hz to several kHz, which includes the frequency of the waves produced by the merger of the two black holes in this scenario."
