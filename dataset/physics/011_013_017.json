    "message_2": "To calculate the electrical conductivity of the copper wire, we first need to find its resistance using the formula:\n\nResistance (R) = Resistivity (ρ) × Length (L) / Cross-sectional Area (A)\n\nGiven:\nResistivity of Copper (ρ) = 1.68 × 10^-8 Ω.m\nLength of the wire (L) = 2 meters\nCross-sectional Area (A) = 1 mm² = 1 × 10^-6 m² (converting to square meters)\n\nNow, let's calculate the resistance:\n\nR = (1.68 × 10^-8 Ω.m) × (2 m) / (1 × 10^-6 m²)\nR = 3.36 × 10^-8 Ω.m² / 10^-6 m²\nR = 3.36 × 10^-2 Ω\n\nNow that we have the resistance, we can calculate the electrical conductivity (σ) using the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = 1 / Resistivity (ρ)\n\nHowever, we can also use the formula:\n\nConductivity (σ) = Cross-sectional Area (A) / (Resistance (R) × Length (L))\n\nUsing the given values:\n\nσ = (1 × 10^-6 m²) / (3.36 × 10^-2 Ω × 2 m)\nσ = 1 × 10^-6 m² / 6.72 × 10^-2 Ω.m\nσ = 1.49 × 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of the copper wire at room temperature (25°C) is approximately 1.49 × 10^7 S/m."
