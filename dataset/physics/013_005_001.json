    "message_2": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the scale factor (a) of the universe. The scale factor is a measure of the size of the universe and increases with time.\n\nLet T1 be the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and T0 be the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (approximately 2.73 Kelvin). Similarly, let a1 be the scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and a0 be the present-day scale factor.\n\nSince the temperature is inversely proportional to the scale factor, we have:\n\nT1 / T0 = a0 / a1\n\nTo find the scale factor ratio (a0 / a1), we need to know the redshift (z) at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The redshift is a measure of how much the universe has expanded since that time. The redshift at the time when the cosmic microwave background radiation was emitted (380,000 years after the Big Bang) is approximately z = 1100.\n\nThe relationship between redshift and scale factor is given by:\n\n1 + z = a0 / a1\n\nSo, for z = 1100:\n\n1 + 1100 = a0 / a1\na0 / a1 = 1101\n\nNow we can use this scale factor ratio to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\nT1 / T0 = a0 / a1\nT1 / 2.73 K = 1101\nT1 = 2.73 K * 1101\n\nT1 â‰ˆ 3000 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang was approximately 3000 Kelvin."
