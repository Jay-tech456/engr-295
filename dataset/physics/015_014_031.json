    "message_2": "To estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the minimum detectable mass for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, we need to consider several factors, including the sensitivity of the detectors, the frequency range they operate in, and the characteristics of the primordial black hole (PBH) population.\n\n1. Sensitivity of the detectors: The sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector is usually represented by its strain sensitivity curve, which shows the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain as a function of frequency that the detector can measure. For ground-based detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the sensitivity is typically best in the range of 10 Hz to a few kHz.\n\n2. Frequency range: The frequency of the gravitational waves produced by a PBH binary system depends on the masses of the black holes and their orbital separation. As the black holes inspiral and merge, the frequency increases. Ground-based detectors are sensitive to gravitational waves in the frequency range mentioned above, which corresponds to black hole binaries with masses ranging from a few solar masses to a few tens of solar masses.\n\n3. PBH population: The mass distribution of the PBH population is uncertain and depends on the specific model of the early universe. However, it is generally believed that PBHs can have a wide range of masses, from sub-solar to thousands of solar masses.\n\nNow, to estimate the SNR and minimum detectable mass, we can use the following approach:\n\na. Calculate the expected gravitational wave strain amplitude for a PBH binary system with given masses and distance from the Earth. This can be done using the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission and the waveform models for inspiraling black hole binaries.\n\nb. Compare the calculated strain amplitude with the strain sensitivity curve of the detector. If the strain amplitude is above the sensitivity curve, the detector can potentially measure the gravitational waves from the PBH binary.\n\nc. Calculate the SNR for the PBH binary system. The SNR is the ratio of the signal amplitude to the noise amplitude in the detector. A higher SNR indicates a more confident detection. Typically, an SNR of 8 or higher is considered a confident detection.\n\nd. Vary the masses of the PBHs and repeat steps a-c to find the minimum detectable mass for the PBH binary system.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a simplified approach, and more detailed calculations and simulations are required to obtain accurate estimates of the SNR and minimum detectable mass. Additionally, the actual detectability of PBH gravitational waves depends on the number of PBH binaries in the universe, their merger rate, and the observation time of the detectors."
