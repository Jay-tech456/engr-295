    "message_2": "To calculate the time dilation effect on the frequency and wavelength of light observed by a stationary observer and a moving observer, we will use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. The relativistic Doppler effect takes into account both the classical Doppler effect and the time dilation effect due to special relativity.\n\nLet's denote the frequency observed by the stationary observer as f_s and the frequency observed by the moving observer as f_m. The speed of the moving observer relative to the stationary observer is v = 0.8c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3x10^8 m/s). The formula for the relativistic Doppler effect is:\n\nf_m = f_s * sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nf_m = f_s * sqrt((1 - 0.8) / (1 + 0.8))\nf_m = f_s * sqrt(0.2 / 1.8)\nf_m = f_s * sqrt(1/9)\nf_m = f_s * (1/3)\n\nSo, the frequency observed by the moving observer is one-third of the frequency observed by the stationary observer.\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength. We know that the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, so:\n\nc = f_s * λ_s = f_m * λ_m\n\nWhere λ_s is the wavelength observed by the stationary observer and λ_m is the wavelength observed by the moving observer. Since f_m = f_s * (1/3), we can write:\n\nc = f_s * λ_s = (f_s * (1/3)) * λ_m\n\nDividing both sides by f_s, we get:\n\nλ_s = (1/3) * λ_m\n\nSo, the wavelength observed by the stationary observer is one-third of the wavelength observed by the moving observer.\n\nIn conclusion, the time dilation effect causes the moving observer to observe a frequency that is one-third of the frequency observed by the stationary observer, and a wavelength that is three times the wavelength observed by the stationary observer."
