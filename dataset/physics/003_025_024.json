    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a distance r from a long straight wire carrying a current I, we can use Ampere's Law. The formula for the magnetic field B at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nI = 5 A (current)\nr = 5 mm = 0.005 m (distance from the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.005 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.01 m)\n\nB = 2π × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field 5 mm away from the copper wire is approximately 2π × 10^(-6) T or approximately 6.28 × 10^(-6) T."
