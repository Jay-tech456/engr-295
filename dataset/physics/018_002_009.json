    "message_2": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the strong force, which is responsible for binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. The strong force is mediated by the exchange of particles called gluons, which carry the \"color charge\" of quarks. In QCD, there are three types of color charges: red, green, and blue, and their corresponding anticolors. Quarks can carry one of these three color charges, while gluons can carry a color-anticolor pair.\n\nWithin a proton, there are three valence quarks: two up quarks and one down quark. These quarks are held together by the strong force, which is mediated by the exchange of gluons. The gluons are constantly being exchanged between the quarks, forming a strong force field that keeps the quarks confined within the proton.\n\nThe overall spin of the proton is determined by the combination of the intrinsic spins of the quarks and the orbital angular momentum of the quarks within the proton. The intrinsic spins of the quarks are described by their half-integer values, with up and down quarks having a spin of +1/2 or -1/2. The orbital angular momentum is determined by the motion of the quarks within the proton.\n\nIn addition to the valence quarks, there are also virtual quark-antiquark pairs and gluons within the proton, which are created and annihilated due to quantum fluctuations. These virtual particles also contribute to the overall spin of the proton.\n\nThe proton's spin can be described as the sum of the spins of the valence quarks, the orbital angular momentum of the quarks, and the contributions from the virtual particles. However, experiments have shown that the valence quarks' spins account for only about 30% of the proton's spin. This is known as the \"proton spin crisis\" or \"spin puzzle.\"\n\nTo account for the remaining 70% of the proton's spin, researchers have proposed that the gluons and the orbital angular momentum of the quarks play a significant role. Recent studies have suggested that the gluons' spin contribution could be substantial, and ongoing experiments are working to determine the exact contributions of the gluons and the orbital angular momentum of the quarks to the proton's spin.\n\nIn summary, the strong force, described by QCD, acts on quarks within a proton by exchanging gluons, which hold the quarks together. The overall spin of the proton is a combination of the intrinsic spins of the valence quarks, the orbital angular momentum of the quarks, and the contributions from virtual particles, including gluons. The exact contributions of these components to the proton's spin are still an active area of research in particle physics."
