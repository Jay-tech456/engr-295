    "message_2": "To implement a general two-qubit quantum gate using cold atoms as qubits in a quantum computing system, you would need a minimum of 2 qubits. This is because a two-qubit gate operates on two qubits simultaneously, and therefore requires at least two qubits to be present in the system."
