    "message_2": "To calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = Σ ΔH_f(products) - Σ ΔH_f(reactants)\n\nThe reaction is given as:\n\n2 H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2 H2O (g)\n\nThe enthalpies of formation (ΔH_f) for the substances involved are:\n\nH2O: -285.8 kJ/mol\nH2: 0 kJ/mol\nO2: 0 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nΔH_reaction = [2 × (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - [(2 × 0 kJ/mol) + (1 × 0 kJ/mol)]\n\nΔH_reaction = (-571.6 kJ) - (0 kJ)\n\nΔH_reaction = -571.6 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is -571.6 kJ."
