    "message_2": "The most precise measurement of the top quark mass obtained from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently 172.22 ± 0.14 (statistical) ± 0.62 (systematic) GeV/c². This result is a combination of measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, as published in a joint paper in 2019.\n\nThe experimental uncertainties associated with this measurement can be divided into two categories: statistical and systematic uncertainties. Statistical uncertainties arise from the limited number of events recorded in the experiments, while systematic uncertainties are related to various experimental factors, such as detector calibration, background estimation, and theoretical modeling. In this case, the statistical uncertainty is ± 0.14 GeV/c², and the systematic uncertainty is ± 0.62 GeV/c²."
