    "message_2": "To find the position of the image formed by the concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe focal length (f) of a concave mirror can be found using the relation:\n\nf = R/2\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the mirror.\n\nGiven the radius of curvature R = 20 cm, we can find the focal length:\n\nf = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v). The object distance (u) is given as 30 cm:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/10 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n(3 + v) / (30v) = 1/10\n\nNow, cross-multiply:\n\n10(3 + v) = 30v\n30 + 10v = 30v\n\nSubtract 10v from both sides:\n\n30 = 20v\n\nNow, divide by 20:\n\nv = 30/20 = 3/2 = 1.5 cm\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 1.5 cm from the mirror.\n\nTo find the magnification (m) of the image, we can use the formula:\n\nm = -v/u\n\nwhere v is the image distance and u is the object distance.\n\nm = -1.5 cm / 30 cm = -1/20 = -0.05\n\nThe magnification of the image is -0.05, which means the image is inverted and 0.05 times the size of the object."
