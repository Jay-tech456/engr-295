    "message_2": "Renormalization is a technique used in quantum field theory, including quantum electrodynamics (QED), to address the issue of infinities that arise in calculations of physical quantities, such as the self-energy of an electron. The self-energy represents the interaction of an electron with its own electromagnetic field, which leads to a correction to its mass and charge. However, when calculated using perturbation theory, the self-energy contains divergent integrals, which yield infinite results. To obtain a physically meaningful, finite value, we use the renormalization technique.\n\nThe renormalization process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Regularization: The first step is to introduce a regularization scheme that makes the divergent integrals finite. There are several regularization methods, such as Pauli-Villars regularization, dimensional regularization, and cutoff regularization. These methods introduce a parameter (e.g., a momentum cutoff or a regularization scale) that suppresses the contribution of high-energy (short-distance) modes to the integrals, making them finite.\n\n2. Renormalization of mass and charge: The next step is to separate the finite and divergent parts of the regularized self-energy. The divergent parts are absorbed into the bare mass and charge of the electron, which are infinite in the context of the theory. The physical mass (m) and charge (e) of the electron are then related to the bare mass (m_0) and charge (e_0) through renormalization constants (Z_m and Z_e):\n\n   m = Z_m * m_0\n   e = Z_e * e_0\n\n3. Renormalization conditions: To determine the renormalization constants, we impose renormalization conditions that relate the renormalized quantities to measurable physical quantities. In QED, these conditions are typically chosen such that the self-energy and vertex function have specific values at a particular renormalization scale (e.g., the on-shell renormalization scheme, where the self-energy vanishes when the electron is on its mass shell).\n\n4. Renormalized perturbation theory: After determining the renormalization constants, we can rewrite the perturbation series in terms of the renormalized mass and charge. The divergences are now absorbed into the renormalization constants, and the remaining terms in the series are finite. This renormalized perturbation theory provides finite results for physical quantities, such as the electron's self-energy.\n\nIn summary, the renormalization technique in quantum electrodynamics allows us to address the issue of infinity in the calculation of the self-energy of an electron by regularizing the divergent integrals, separating the finite and divergent parts, and absorbing the divergences into the renormalization constants. This process results in a finite, physically meaningful value for the self-energy and other quantities of interest."
