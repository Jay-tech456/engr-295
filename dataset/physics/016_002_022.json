    "message_2": "The Meissner effect is a phenomenon observed in superconductors, where the superconductor expels magnetic fields from its interior when it transitions into the superconducting state. This effect helps to distinguish a superconductor from a normal conductor, as normal conductors do not exhibit this behavior.\n\nThe mathematical explanation behind the Meissner effect can be understood using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory and the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors near their critical temperature.\n\n1. Ginzburg-Landau theory: This theory introduces a complex order parameter, ψ, which represents the amplitude and phase of the superconducting electron wave function. The GL free energy functional, F, depends on the order parameter and the magnetic field, B. The equilibrium state of the superconductor is determined by minimizing this free energy functional. The GL equations are derived from this minimization process:\n\n∇²ψ - (1/ξ²)ψ + |ψ|²ψ = 0\nB = (ħ/2e) * (1/λ²) * Im(ψ*∇ψ)\n\nHere, ξ is the coherence length, λ is the penetration depth, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and e is the elementary charge. The first equation is the GL equation for the order parameter, and the second equation relates the magnetic field to the order parameter.\n\n2. London equations: The London equations describe the behavior of the superconducting current density, J_s, and the magnetic field, B, in a superconductor:\n\nJ_s = - (n_s * e² * λ² / m) * A\n∇ x B = μ₀ * J_s\n\nHere, n_s is the superconducting electron density, m is the electron mass, A is the vector potential, and μ₀ is the vacuum permeability. The first equation is the London equation for the superconducting current density, and the second equation is the Ampere-Maxwell equation.\n\nWhen a superconductor transitions into the superconducting state, the order parameter ψ becomes non-zero, and the magnetic field is expelled from the interior of the superconductor due to the Meissner effect. This can be understood by combining the GL and London equations. The magnetic field penetration depth, λ, becomes finite in the superconducting state, and the magnetic field decays exponentially within the superconductor with a characteristic length scale of λ.\n\nThe Meissner effect is a key property that distinguishes superconductors from normal conductors. In a normal conductor, magnetic fields can penetrate the material without significant attenuation. In contrast, a superconductor in the Meissner state expels magnetic fields from its interior, leading to perfect diamagnetism. This unique behavior is a direct consequence of the superconducting state and the associated formation of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconducting properties."
