    "message_1": "A liquid of viscosity 0.05 Pa s flows through a tube of length 3m and radius 0.02m. The pressure difference between the ends of the tube is 20 Pa. If the flow is laminar, what is the volume flow rate of the liquid?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume flow rate of the liquid, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube:\n\nQ = (π * R^4 * ΔP) / (8 * η * L)\n\nWhere:\nQ = volume flow rate (m^3/s)\nR = radius of the tube (m)\nΔP = pressure difference between the ends of the tube (Pa)\nη = viscosity of the liquid (Pa s)\nL = length of the tube (m)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nQ = (π * (0.02)^4 * 20) / (8 * 0.05 * 3)\n\nQ = (π * 1.6 * 10^-7 * 20) / (1.2)\n\nQ = (3.14159 * 3.2 * 10^-6) / (1.2)\n\nQ = 8.377 * 10^-6 m^3/s\n\nSo, the volume flow rate of the liquid is approximately 8.377 x 10^-6 m^3/s."
