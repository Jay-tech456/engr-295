    "message_2": "Malus' Law states that the intensity of light coming out of a polarizer is given by the equation:\n\nI_out = I_in * cos²(θ)\n\nwhere I_out is the intensity of the light coming out of the polarizer, I_in is the intensity of the incident light, and θ is the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the polarization direction of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, I_in = 10 W/m² and θ = 30°. To find the intensity of the light coming out of the polarizer, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nI_out = 10 * cos²(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 30°:\n\ncos(30°) = √3/2\n\nNow, we can square the cosine and multiply by the incident intensity:\n\nI_out = 10 * ( (√3/2)² )\nI_out = 10 * (3/4)\nI_out = 7.5 W/m²\n\nSo, the intensity of the light coming out of the polarizer is 7.5 W/m²."
