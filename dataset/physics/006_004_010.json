    "message_2": "The Stark effect refers to the splitting and shifting of spectral lines in atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. In the case of hydrogen, the energy shift observed in the spectral lines is primarily due to the interaction between the electric field and the electric dipole moment of the atom.\n\nThe energy shift (ΔE) in the hydrogen spectral lines due to the Stark effect can be approximated using the first-order perturbation theory. For the hydrogen atom, the energy shift is given by:\n\nΔE = -μ * E\n\nwhere μ is the electric dipole moment of the hydrogen atom and E is the electric field strength.\n\nThe electric dipole moment μ can be expressed as:\n\nμ = e * d\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 * 10^(-19) C) and d is the distance between the nucleus and the electron in the hydrogen atom.\n\nThe energy shift ΔE is proportional to the electric field strength E. As the electric field strength increases, the energy shift in the hydrogen spectral lines also increases. This relationship is linear for small electric field strengths, but it can become more complex for stronger electric fields, where higher-order perturbation terms may become significant."
