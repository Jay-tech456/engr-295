    "message_2": "To calculate the kinetic energy of the particle using relativistic principles, we need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle (0.8c in this case).\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.36)\nγ = 1 / 0.6\nγ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nHowever, we don't have the mass of the particle (m) given in the problem. So, we can only express the kinetic energy in terms of the mass:\n\nK = (1.67 - 1)mc^2\nK = 0.67mc^2\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the particle is 0.67 times its mass-energy equivalence. To find the exact value of the kinetic energy, we would need the mass of the particle."
