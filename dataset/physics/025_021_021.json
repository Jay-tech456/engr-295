    "message_2": "To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the denaturation of a protein, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - TΔS\n\nwhere ΔH is the enthalpy of denaturation, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the entropy change.\n\nHowever, we don't have the entropy change (ΔS) given in the problem. To find ΔS, we can use the relationship between the melting temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy and entropy changes:\n\nTm = ΔH / ΔS\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ΔS:\n\nΔS = ΔH / Tm\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for ΔS back into the Gibbs free energy equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - T(ΔH / Tm)\n\nGiven that the temperature is 37°C, we need to convert it to Kelvin:\n\nT = 37°C + 273.15 = 310.15 K\n\nNow we can plug in the values for T, ΔH, and Tm into the equation:\n\nΔG = ΔH - 310.15(ΔH / Tm)\n\nWithout the specific values for ΔH and Tm, we cannot calculate the exact value of ΔG. However, if you provide the values for ΔH and Tm, you can use the equation above to find the Gibbs free energy change for the denaturation of the protein."
