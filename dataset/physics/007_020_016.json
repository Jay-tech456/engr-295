    "message_2": "To find the number of particles per second being emitted by the radiation source, we can first determine the relationship between the output voltage and the number of counts.\n\nGiven that a 2.5V output corresponds to 100 counts, we can set up a proportion:\n\n2.5V / 100 counts = 3.75V / x counts\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx counts = (3.75V * 100 counts) / 2.5V\nx counts = 375 counts\n\nSo, the radiation source is emitting 375 particles per second."
