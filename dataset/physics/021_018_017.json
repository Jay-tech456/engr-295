    "message_2": "Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, such as a black hole, distorts the spacetime around it, causing light to follow curved paths. This effect is a direct consequence of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass.\n\nWhen light from a distant object, like a star or galaxy, passes close to a massive object like a black hole, the spacetime curvature causes the light to bend. This bending of light creates multiple, distorted, or magnified images of the distant object, which is the gravitational lensing effect.\n\nThe mathematical relationship between the mass of the black hole and the extent of the lensing effect can be described using the Einstein radius formula. The Einstein radius (θ_E) is the angular separation between the true position of the distant object and its lensed image. The formula for the Einstein radius is:\n\nθ_E = √(4GM/c² * D_LS / (D_L * D_S))\n\nwhere:\n- G is the gravitational constant,\n- M is the mass of the black hole,\n- c is the speed of light,\n- D_L is the distance from the observer to the lens (the black hole),\n- D_S is the distance from the observer to the source (the distant object), and\n- D_LS is the distance from the lens to the source.\n\nThe extent of the lensing effect is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole. As the mass of the black hole increases, the curvature of spacetime around it becomes more pronounced, resulting in a larger Einstein radius and a more significant lensing effect. Conversely, as the mass of the black hole decreases, the lensing effect becomes less pronounced."
