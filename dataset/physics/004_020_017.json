    "message_2": "In the theory of General Relativity, the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system depend on the masses and separation of the two objects in the system. The gravitational wave emission is a consequence of the time-varying quadrupole moment of the mass distribution in the system.\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves (h) is proportional to the mass of the system and inversely proportional to the distance (r) from the system. Specifically, the amplitude is given by:\n\nh ~ (G/c^4) * (M * a) / r\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, M is the total mass of the system (sum of the two objects' masses), and a is the separation between the two objects.\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves (f) is related to the orbital frequency of the binary system. As the two objects orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves, which carry away energy and angular momentum from the system. This causes the objects to spiral inwards, leading to an increase in the orbital frequency. The frequency of the emitted gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf = 2 * f_orbital\n\nThe orbital frequency (f_orbital) depends on the masses of the objects and their separation. According to Kepler's third law, the orbital period (T) is related to the semi-major axis (a) and the total mass (M) of the system:\n\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * M)\n\nFrom this, we can find the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = 1 / T\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of the gravitational waves depends on the mass of the system and the separation between the two objects, while the frequency of the gravitational waves depends on the orbital frequency of the binary system, which in turn depends on the masses and separation of the objects. As the objects spiral inwards due to the emission of gravitational waves, both the amplitude and frequency of the emitted waves increase."
