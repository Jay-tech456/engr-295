    "message_2": "The J/psi meson is a bound state of a charm quark (c) and an anti-charm quark (c̅). It has a mass of about 3.1 GeV/c² and is a vector meson with a spin of 1. The J/psi meson can decay through several different processes, but the main decay modes are either through electromagnetic decay or strong decay.\n\n1. Electromagnetic decay:\nThe J/psi meson can decay electromagnetically into a lepton-antilepton pair. The branching ratios for these decay modes are:\n\na) J/psi → e⁺e⁻ (electron-positron pair)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 5.94%\n\nb) J/psi → μ⁺μ⁻ (muon-antimuon pair)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 5.93%\n\n2. Hadronic decay (strong decay):\nThe J/psi meson can decay through the strong interaction into various hadronic final states. The most common hadronic decay modes are:\n\na) J/psi → ρπ (rho meson and pion)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 1.7%\n\nb) J/psi → ωπ (omega meson and pion)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.2%\n\nc) J/psi → K⁺K⁻ (kaon and anti-kaon)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 2.0%\n\nd) J/psi → K*⁺K⁻ + K*⁻K⁺ (kaon and anti-kaon with excited states)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 1.5%\n\ne) J/psi → 3π (three pions)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.8%\n\nf) J/psi → 4π (four pions)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.5%\n\ng) J/psi → 5π (five pions)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.1%\n\nh) J/psi → pp̅ (proton and anti-proton)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.02%\n\ni) J/psi → ΛΛ̅ (Lambda baryon and anti-Lambda baryon)\nBranching ratio: ≈ 0.01%\n\nThese are some of the most common decay modes of the J/psi meson. There are many other less common decay modes, but the ones listed above account for the majority of the decays. Note that the branching ratios are approximate and can vary slightly depending on the source."
