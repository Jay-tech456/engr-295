    "message_1": "What is the frequency of the lowest-energy acoustic phonon mode in a one-dimensional crystal lattice made up of identical atoms, assuming nearest-neighbor interactions only? How does this frequency change if the interatomic spacing is increased by 10%? (Assume harmonic approximation and neglect any anharmonic effects.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the dispersion relation for a one-dimensional crystal lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions only. In the harmonic approximation, the dispersion relation for acoustic phonons in a 1D lattice is given by:\n\nω(k) = √(4K/M) * |sin(k*a/2)|\n\nwhere ω(k) is the angular frequency of the phonon mode with wave vector k, K is the spring constant between nearest-neighbor atoms, M is the mass of each atom, and a is the interatomic spacing.\n\nThe lowest-energy acoustic phonon mode corresponds to the smallest wave vector k, which is k = 0. In this case, the dispersion relation simplifies to:\n\nω(0) = 0\n\nThis means that the frequency of the lowest-energy acoustic phonon mode is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the interatomic spacing is increased by 10%. The new interatomic spacing a' is given by:\n\na' = 1.1 * a\n\nThe dispersion relation for the new lattice is:\n\nω'(k) = √(4K/M) * |sin(k*a'/2)|\n\nAgain, we want to find the lowest-energy mode, which corresponds to k = 0:\n\nω'(0) = 0\n\nSo, even after increasing the interatomic spacing by 10%, the frequency of the lowest-energy acoustic phonon mode remains 0. This is because the lowest-energy mode corresponds to the uniform motion of all atoms in the lattice, which doesn't involve any relative displacement between neighboring atoms, and thus doesn't depend on the interatomic spacing."
