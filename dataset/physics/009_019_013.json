    "message_2": "In a Young's double-slit experiment, the interference pattern is formed due to the superposition of waves from two slits. The condition for constructive interference (maxima) is given by:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nwhere d is the distance between the slits, θ is the angle of the maximum, m is the order of the maximum (0, 1, 2, ...), and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the angle θ = 30 degrees and the distance from the slits to the screen L = 1 meter. We need to find the distance between the slits, d.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the central maximum (m = 0) and the first maximum (m = 1) on the screen. This distance can be calculated using the small-angle approximation:\n\ny = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * sin(θ)\n\nwhere y is the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum.\n\nConverting the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance y:\n\ny = L * sin(θ) = 1 * sin(π / 6) = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5 meters\n\nNext, we need to find the wavelength of the light. We can use the formula for the distance between maxima in the interference pattern:\n\ny = (m * λ * L) / d\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for λ:\n\nλ = (y * d) / (m * L)\n\nSince we are considering the first maximum (m = 1), the formula becomes:\n\nλ = (0.5 * d) / 1\n\nNow, we can use the condition for constructive interference:\n\nd * sin(θ) = m * λ\n\nSubstituting the values for sin(θ) and λ:\n\nd * 0.5 = 1 * (0.5 * d) / 1\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd = 1 meter\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the Young's double-slit experiment is 1 meter."
