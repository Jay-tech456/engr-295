    "message_2": "The superconducting alloy YBa2Cu3O7, also known as YBCO, is a high-temperature superconductor with a critical temperature (Tc) of approximately 92 K (-181°C) in the absence of an external magnetic field. The critical magnetic field (Hc) of YBCO is dependent on the temperature and can be described by the empirical relation:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field at 0 K, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nTo find the critical temperature and critical magnetic field when subjected to an external magnetic field of 1 Tesla, we need to consider the upper critical field (Hc2) of YBCO. The upper critical field is the maximum magnetic field that the superconductor can tolerate before transitioning back to the normal state. For YBCO, the upper critical field (Hc2) at 0 K is approximately 100 Tesla.\n\nUsing the same empirical relation for Hc2(T):\n\nHc2(T) = Hc2(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nWe can now solve for the temperature at which the upper critical field is equal to 1 Tesla:\n\n1 T = 100 T * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT ≈ 0.9 * Tc ≈ 0.9 * 92 K ≈ 82.8 K\n\nSo, the critical temperature when subjected to an external magnetic field of 1 Tesla is approximately 82.8 K.\n\nThe critical magnetic field at this temperature can be calculated using the Hc(T) relation:\n\nHc(82.8 K) = Hc(0) * (1 - (82.8/92)^2)\n\nUnfortunately, the exact value of Hc(0) for YBCO is not well-defined in the literature, but it is typically on the order of 0.1 - 1 Tesla. Assuming Hc(0) = 1 T, we get:\n\nHc(82.8 K) ≈ 1 T * (1 - (82.8/92)^2) ≈ 0.33 T\n\nSo, the critical magnetic field at 82.8 K is approximately 0.33 Tesla. However, this value may vary depending on the exact value of Hc(0) for YBCO."
