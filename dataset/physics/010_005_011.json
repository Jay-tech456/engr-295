    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force acting on a sphere, we can use the drag force equation:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * C_D * ρ * v^2 * A\n\nwhere F_D is the drag force, C_D is the drag coefficient, ρ is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the sphere, and A is the cross-sectional area of the sphere.\n\nGiven values:\nRadius (r) = 0.05 m\nVelocity (v) = 5 m/s\nFluid density (ρ) = 1.2 kg/m^3\nDrag coefficient (C_D) = 0.47\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area (A) of the sphere. The cross-sectional area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nA = π * r^2\n\nA = π * (0.05 m)^2\nA ≈ 0.00785 m^2\n\nNow, we can plug the given values into the drag force equation:\n\nF_D = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1.2 kg/m^3 * (5 m/s)^2 * 0.00785 m^2\n\nF_D ≈ 0.5 * 0.47 * 1.2 * 25 * 0.00785\nF_D ≈ 0.69495 N\n\nThe drag force acting on the sphere is approximately 0.695 N."
