    "message_1": "What is the expected decay rate of a particle undergoing weak interaction, given its mass and lifetime, and how accurately can this be measured using precision techniques such as double beta decay?",
    "message_2": "The decay rate of a particle undergoing weak interaction can be determined using the decay constant (λ), which is the probability per unit time that a particle will decay. The decay constant is related to the particle's mean lifetime (τ) by the following equation:\n\nλ = 1/τ\n\nTo find the expected decay rate, we can use the activity (A) of the particle, which is the number of decays per unit time. The activity is given by the product of the decay constant and the number of particles (N):\n\nA = λN\n\nIn the case of double beta decay, two beta particles (electrons or positrons) are emitted simultaneously from the nucleus. This is a rare second-order weak interaction process, and its half-life can be extremely long, ranging from 10^18 to 10^25 years or more. The decay rate for double beta decay can be determined using the same equations mentioned above.\n\nThe accuracy of measuring the decay rate using precision techniques such as double beta decay depends on several factors, including the purity of the sample, the efficiency of the detectors, and the ability to reduce background noise. In recent years, experiments like GERDA, CUORE, and EXO have achieved impressive levels of sensitivity, allowing them to measure decay rates with high precision.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the decay rate of a particle undergoing weak interaction depends on the specific particle and the type of decay process. Therefore, the accuracy of the measurement will vary depending on the specific case."
