    "message_2": "To find the relativistic energy and momentum of the rocket, we'll use the following equations:\n\n1. Relativistic momentum (p): p = (mv) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n2. Relativistic energy (E): E = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nGiven:\nRest mass (m) = 2000 kg\nVelocity (v) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic momentum (p):\n\np = (2000 kg * 0.6c) / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\np = (2000 kg * 0.6c) / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\np = (2000 kg * 0.6c) / sqrt(0.64)\n\nNow, let's find the relativistic energy (E):\n\nE = (2000 kg * c^2) / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)\nE = (2000 kg * c^2) / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nE = (2000 kg * c^2) / sqrt(0.64)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of c (speed of light) which is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s:\n\np = (2000 kg * 0.6 * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / sqrt(0.64)\np ≈ (2000 kg * 1.8 x 10^8 m/s) / 0.8\np ≈ 4.5 x 10^8 kg m/s\n\nE = (2000 kg * (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2) / sqrt(0.64)\nE ≈ (2000 kg * 9.0 x 10^16 m^2/s^2) / 0.8\nE ≈ 2.25 x 10^17 J (joules)\n\nSo, the relativistic momentum of the rocket is approximately 4.5 x 10^8 kg m/s, and the relativistic energy is approximately 2.25 x 10^17 J."
