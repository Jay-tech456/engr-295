    "message_2": "The tau lepton (τ) is the heaviest of the three charged leptons (electron, muon, and tau). Its mass is approximately 1.77686 GeV/c² (giga-electron volts divided by the speed of light squared), which is equivalent to about 3.167 × 10⁻²⁸ kg.\n\nTau leptons are unstable particles and decay through the weak force. They have a very short lifetime of about 2.9 × 10⁻¹³ seconds. Tau leptons can decay into either leptonic or hadronic modes.\n\nIn leptonic decays, a tau lepton decays into a lighter charged lepton (electron or muon) and two neutrinos (one tau neutrino and one electron or muon antineutrino). The leptonic decay modes are:\n\n1. τ⁻ → e⁻ + νₑ + ν̄_τ (tau decays into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a tau neutrino)\n2. τ⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_μ + ν̄_τ (tau decays into a muon, a muon antineutrino, and a tau neutrino)\n\nIn hadronic decays, a tau lepton decays into one or more hadrons (particles made of quarks) and a tau neutrino. The hadronic decay modes typically involve one or three charged pions, along with neutral pions in some cases. Some examples of hadronic decay modes are:\n\n1. τ⁻ → π⁻ + ν_τ (tau decays into a negatively charged pion and a tau neutrino)\n2. τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁰ + ν_τ (tau decays into a negatively charged pion, a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino)\n3. τ⁻ → π⁻ + π⁻ + π⁺ + ν_τ (tau decays into two negatively charged pions, a positively charged pion, and a tau neutrino)\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many possible decay modes for tau leptons. In summary, the mass of the tau lepton is about 1.77686 GeV/c², and it decays through the weak force into various leptonic or hadronic final states."
