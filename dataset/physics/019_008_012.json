    "message_2": "In quantum field theory, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is a measure of the deviation of the electron's magnetic moment from the classical Dirac magnetic moment. At the first non-trivial order of perturbation theory, the anomalous magnetic moment is given by the famous Schwinger's result, which is derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n\nThe anomalous magnetic moment (g-factor) is given by:\n\ng = 2(1 + a)\n\nwhere a is the anomalous magnetic moment and g = 2 for the Dirac magnetic moment. The first non-trivial order of perturbation theory in QED gives the following expression for a:\n\na = (α / 2π)\n\nHere, α is the fine-structure constant, which is approximately equal to 1/137. The fine-structure constant is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of the anomalous magnetic moment:\n\na = (1 / 137) / (2π) ≈ 0.00116\n\nThus, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron at the first non-trivial order of perturbation theory is approximately 0.00116. This result includes the contributions from the electron's interaction with its own magnetic field and virtual electron-positron pairs."
