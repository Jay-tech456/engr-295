    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop, we can use Ampere's Law and the Biot-Savart Law. However, since the loop is not a simple shape like a circle or a straight wire, we need to break the triangle into three segments and calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment separately. Then, we can find the total magnetic field by adding up the contributions from each segment.\n\nFirst, let's find the angles of the triangular loop using the Law of Cosines:\n\nα = arccos((b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2bc))\nβ = arccos((a^2 + c^2 - b^2) / (2ac))\nγ = arccos((a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab))\n\nwhere a = 10 cm, b = 15 cm, and c = 20 cm.\n\nα = arccos((15^2 + 20^2 - 10^2) / (2 * 15 * 20)) = arccos(0.75) ≈ 41.41°\nβ = arccos((10^2 + 20^2 - 15^2) / (2 * 10 * 20)) = arccos(0.625) ≈ 51.34°\nγ = arccos((10^2 + 15^2 - 20^2) / (2 * 10 * 15)) = arccos(-0.25) ≈ 104.48°\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment using the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A is the permeability of free space, I = 2 A is the current, dl is the length of the segment, θ is the angle between the segment and the position vector, and r is the distance from the segment to the center of the loop.\n\nFor each segment, we can find the distance r by using the formula:\n\nr = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)\n\nwhere area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))^0.5 and s = (a + b + c) / 2 is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\ns = (10 + 15 + 20) / 2 = 22.5 cm\narea = (22.5 * (22.5 - 10) * (22.5 - 15) * (22.5 - 20))^0.5 ≈ 72.62 cm^2\nr = (10 * 15 * 20) / (4 * 72.62) ≈ 10.31 cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field contribution from each segment:\n\ndB₁ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 10 cm * sin(104.48°)) / (4 * π * (10.31 cm)^2) ≈ 1.31 × 10^(-7) T\ndB₂ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 15 cm * sin(51.34°)) / (4 * π * (10.31 cm)^2) ≈ 2.91 × 10^(-7) T\ndB₃ = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 20 cm * sin(41.41°)) / (4 * π * (10.31 cm)^2) ≈ 3.48 × 10^(-7) T\n\nFinally, we can find the total magnetic field at the center of the loop by adding up the contributions from each segment:\n\nB_total = dB₁ + dB₂ + dB₃ ≈ 1.31 × 10^(-7) T + 2.91 × 10^(-7) T + 3.48 × 10^(-7) T ≈ 7.70 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the triangular loop is approximately 7.70 × 10^(-7) T."
