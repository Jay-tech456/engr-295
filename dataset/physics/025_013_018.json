    "message_2": "The frequency and wavelength of light play a crucial role in determining the color perception in the human eye. The visible light spectrum consists of a range of wavelengths, each corresponding to a specific color. The human eye contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain to process the information.\n\nThere are two types of photoreceptors in the human eye: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to a specific range of wavelengths: short-wavelength cones (S-cones) for blue light, medium-wavelength cones (M-cones) for green light, and long-wavelength cones (L-cones) for red light.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the lens, and the vitreous humor before reaching the retina, where the photoreceptors are located. The cones absorb the light and convert it into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals and interprets them as color.\n\nThe frequency and wavelength of light determine the color perceived by the human eye as follows:\n\n1. High-frequency, short-wavelength light (around 400-450 nm) is perceived as violet or blue. This light is primarily detected by the S-cones.\n\n2. Medium-frequency, medium-wavelength light (around 450-550 nm) is perceived as green or yellow. This light is mainly detected by the M-cones.\n\n3. Low-frequency, long-wavelength light (around 550-700 nm) is perceived as orange or red. This light is predominantly detected by the L-cones.\n\nThe perception of other colors, such as purple, pink, or brown, results from the combined stimulation of multiple types of cones. For example, purple is perceived when both the S-cones (blue) and L-cones (red) are stimulated simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, the frequency and wavelength of light affect color perception in the human eye by stimulating specific types of cones, which then transmit signals to the brain to be processed and interpreted as color. The visible light spectrum, ranging from high-frequency, short-wavelength violet light to low-frequency, long-wavelength red light, determines the range of colors that humans can perceive."
