    "message_2": "The large-scale structure of the universe plays a significant role in the motion and distribution of galaxies. This structure is primarily shaped by the distribution of dark matter and the influence of gravity, which causes galaxies to form in specific patterns such as clusters, superclusters, and cosmic filaments.\n\n1. Clusters and Superclusters: Galaxies are not uniformly distributed throughout the universe. Instead, they are found in groups called clusters, which can contain hundreds or even thousands of galaxies. These clusters are bound together by gravity, causing the galaxies within them to interact and influence each other's motion. Clusters can further combine to form larger structures called superclusters. The Virgo Supercluster, for example, contains our own Milky Way galaxy along with numerous other galaxy clusters.\n\n2. Cosmic Filaments: The large-scale structure of the universe also includes vast, thread-like formations known as cosmic filaments. These filaments are composed of dark matter and gas, and they serve as the \"scaffolding\" upon which galaxies and galaxy clusters are built. The gravitational forces within these filaments attract galaxies, causing them to align along the filamentary structure. This alignment can be observed in the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe.\n\n3. Dark Matter: Dark matter is a mysterious, invisible substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass. Although it cannot be directly observed, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe, as it provides the necessary gravitational force to hold galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments together.\n\n4. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB is the residual radiation from the Big Bang and provides valuable information about the early universe. Observations of the CMB have revealed tiny fluctuations in temperature, which correspond to the initial distribution of matter in the universe. These fluctuations serve as the \"seeds\" for the formation of the large-scale structure, as regions with higher density would eventually attract more matter and form galaxy clusters and filaments.\n\n5. Redshift Surveys: Astronomers use redshift surveys to map the distribution of galaxies in the universe. By measuring the redshift of light emitted by galaxies, scientists can determine their distance and position in space. These surveys have provided strong evidence for the existence of galaxy clusters, superclusters, and cosmic filaments, as well as the influence of dark matter on the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the large-scale structure of the universe significantly affects the motion and distribution of galaxies. The presence of dark matter, the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters, and the alignment of galaxies along cosmic filaments all contribute to the observed patterns of galaxy distribution. Observations of the CMB and redshift surveys provide crucial evidence supporting these conclusions."
