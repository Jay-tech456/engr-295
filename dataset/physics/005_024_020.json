    "message_1": "\"A spaceship is traveling away from a planet at 0.9c, while on board, the astronauts observe that the distance between the planet and another star is shortened due to relativistic effects. How much shorter is the distance between the planet and the star according to the astronauts on the spaceship?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. Length contraction states that the length of an object or distance between two points, as measured by an observer moving relative to the object or points, is shorter than the length measured by an observer at rest relative to the object or points.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L' is the contracted length (the distance between the planet and the star as measured by the astronauts on the spaceship), L is the proper length (the distance between the planet and the star as measured by an observer at rest relative to the planet and the star), v is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.9c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given that the spaceship is traveling at 0.9c, so we can plug this into the formula:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - 0.81)\n\nL' = L * sqrt(0.19)\n\nNow, we can say that the distance between the planet and the star as measured by the astronauts on the spaceship (L') is 0.19 times shorter than the distance measured by an observer at rest relative to the planet and the star (L)."
