    "message_2": "The strong nuclear force, also known as the strong force or strong interaction, is the force responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak force.\n\nThe range of the strong nuclear force is quite short, typically around 1 to 3 femtometers (1 femtometer = 1 x 10^-15 meters). This means that the strong force only acts over very short distances, comparable to the size of atomic nuclei.\n\nThe strength of the strong nuclear force is much greater than the electromagnetic force, which is responsible for repelling protons from each other due to their positive charges. The strong force is approximately 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force at the scale of nucleons. However, its strength decreases rapidly as the distance between nucleons increases, which is why it only acts over short distances.\n\nIn summary, the strong nuclear force has a range of about 1 to 3 femtometers and is approximately 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force at the scale of nucleons."
