    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is given by:\n\nB = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length (turns/m), and I is the current (A).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of turns per cm to turns per meter:\n\nn = 400 turns/cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 40000 turns/m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (40000 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB ≈ 1.005 × 10^(-3) T\n\nSince the problem asks for the magnetic field at a distance of 0.5 cm from the center of the solenoid, we need to consider that the magnetic field is approximately uniform inside the solenoid, and its strength doesn't change significantly over small distances from the center. Therefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 0.5 cm from the center of the solenoid is approximately:\n\nB ≈ 1.005 × 10^(-3) T"
