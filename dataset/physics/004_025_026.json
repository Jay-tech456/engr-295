    "message_2": "Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects. In the case of primordial black holes, these waves can be produced by their mergers, interactions with other massive objects, or even by their formation in the early Universe.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves depends on the mass of the black holes involved and the distance from the observer. The frequency of gravitational waves produced by a binary system of black holes can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / t)^3/8\n\nwhere f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the black holes merge.\n\nFor primordial black holes, we can consider the mass range from 10^-18 solar masses (M☉) to 10^2 M☉. The frequency range of gravitational waves produced by these black holes can be estimated using the formula above and the following assumptions:\n\n1. The time until the black holes merge is roughly equal to the age of the Universe, which is about 13.8 billion years or 4.35 x 10^17 seconds.\n2. The masses of the black holes are equal.\n\nUsing these assumptions, we can estimate the frequency range of gravitational waves produced by primordial black holes:\n\nFor a mass of 10^-18 M☉:\nf_min = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / (4.35 x 10^17))^3/8 ≈ 10^-10 Hz\n\nFor a mass of 10^2 M☉:\nf_max = (c^3 / G) * (5/256) * (1 / (4.35 x 10^17))^3/8 ≈ 10^4 Hz\n\nSo, the expected frequency range of gravitational waves produced by primordial black holes with different masses in the Universe is roughly between 10^-10 Hz and 10^4 Hz.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves also depends on the distance from the observer. As the waves travel through the Universe, they get redshifted due to the expansion of the Universe. The observed frequency (f_obs) is related to the emitted frequency (f_em) by:\n\nf_obs = f_em / (1 + z)\n\nwhere z is the redshift. The farther away the black holes are, the higher the redshift, and the lower the observed frequency. However, this effect is more relevant for high-redshift events, and the frequency range estimated above should still provide a good approximation for nearby primordial black holes."
