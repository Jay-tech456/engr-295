    "message_2": "To calculate the expected rate of detection of gravitational waves from a population of primordial black holes, we need to consider the number of galaxies within the given range, the merger rate per galaxy, and the probability of detecting a merger event.\n\n1. Number of galaxies within the range:\nThe volume of a sphere with a radius of 5000 Mpc is given by V = (4/3)πr^3, where r = 5000 Mpc. Therefore, the volume is approximately 5.24 x 10^11 Mpc^3.\n\nAssuming a galaxy density of approximately 0.01 galaxies per Mpc^3, there would be around 5.24 x 10^9 galaxies within the given range.\n\n2. Merger rate per galaxy:\nThe given merger rate is 10^-7 yr^-1 per Milky Way-type galaxy.\n\n3. Probability of detection:\nTo estimate the probability of detecting a merger event, we need to consider the observational sensitivity. The strain sensitivity (h) is given as 10^-24 Hz^-1/2. The amplitude of the gravitational wave signal (A) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) from the source, i.e., A ∝ 1/d.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the average distance to the black hole mergers is 5000 Mpc. The amplitude of the signal would be A = h * sqrt(f), where f is the frequency of the gravitational wave signal. Since we don't have the frequency information, we cannot calculate the exact probability of detection. However, we can still estimate the expected detection rate using the merger rate and the number of galaxies.\n\n4. Expected detection rate:\nThe expected detection rate (R) can be calculated as the product of the number of galaxies (N), the merger rate per galaxy (M), and the probability of detection (P). Since we don't have the exact probability of detection, we can write the expected detection rate as R = N * M * P.\n\nAssuming a conservative detection probability (P) of 0.1, the expected detection rate would be R = 5.24 x 10^9 * 10^-7 * 0.1 ≈ 524 events per year.\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual detection rate may vary depending on various factors such as the frequency of the gravitational wave signal, the sensitivity of the detectors, and the distribution of black hole masses."
