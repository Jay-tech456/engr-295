    "message_2": "To find the electron density, we can use the plasma frequency formula:\n\nω_p^2 = (n_e * e^2) / (ε_0 * m_e)\n\nwhere ω_p is the plasma frequency, n_e is the electron density, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C), ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10^-12 F/m), and m_e is the electron mass (9.11 × 10^-31 kg).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the plasma frequency from GHz to Hz:\n\n4 GHz = 4 × 10^9 Hz\n\nNow, we can solve for the electron density:\n\nn_e = (ω_p^2 * ε_0 * m_e) / e^2\n\nn_e = ((4 × 10^9)^2 * (8.85 × 10^-12) * (9.11 × 10^-31)) / (1.6 × 10^-19)^2\n\nn_e ≈ 1.24 × 10^18 m^-3\n\nNow, to find the electron temperature, we can use the formula for the refractive index in a plasma:\n\nn = sqrt(1 - (ω_p^2 / ω^2))\n\nwhere n is the refractive index and ω is the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Since we are given the refractive index (1.1) and the plasma frequency (4 GHz), we can solve for the angular frequency:\n\nω = ω_p / sqrt(n^2 - 1)\n\nω = (4 × 10^9) / sqrt(1.1^2 - 1)\n\nω ≈ 1.2 × 10^10 rad/s\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the electron collision frequency (ν_e):\n\nν_e = (ω^2 * m_e * ε_0) / (e^2 * n_e)\n\nWe are given the electron collision frequency (5 MHz = 5 × 10^6 Hz), so we can solve for the electron temperature (T_e) using the formula:\n\nν_e = (e^2 * n_e) / (k_B * T_e)\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K).\n\nT_e = (e^2 * n_e) / (k_B * ν_e)\n\nT_e = ((1.6 × 10^-19)^2 * (1.24 × 10^18)) / ((1.38 × 10^-23) * (5 × 10^6))\n\nT_e ≈ 3617 K\n\nSo, the electron density of the plasma is approximately 1.24 × 10^18 m^-3, and the electron temperature is approximately 3617 K."
