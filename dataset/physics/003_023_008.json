    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use Ampere's Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I) divided by the length of the loop (2πr), where r is the radius of the loop.\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nGiven the current (I) is 5 A and the radius (r) is 0.5 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.5 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (π m)\n\nB = (20 × 10^(-7) Tm) / (1 m)\n\nB = 20 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at the center of the loop is 2 × 10^(-6) T or 2 μT."
