    "message_2": "The maximum resolution of the human eye is determined by the density of photoreceptor cells in the retina, specifically the cones, which are responsible for color vision and high-resolution vision. The highest density of cones is found in the fovea, a small area in the center of the retina. The maximum resolution of the human eye is approximately 60 pixels per degree or 1 arcminute, which translates to a visual acuity of 20/20.\n\nThe resolution of the eye can be affected by the wavelength of light. The human eye is most sensitive to green light, with a wavelength of around 555 nm. As the wavelength of light moves away from this optimal value, the eye's ability to resolve details decreases. This is due to the fact that the eye's lens and the photoreceptor cells have different sensitivities to different wavelengths of light.\n\nThe sensitivity of the eye changes in different lighting conditions. In bright light, the eye relies primarily on cones for vision, which are responsible for high-resolution and color vision. In low light conditions, the eye relies more on rod cells, which are more sensitive to light but do not provide color information or high-resolution vision. This is why our vision becomes less detailed and more monochromatic in low light conditions.\n\nColor blindness can be explained by the physics of light perception. In the human eye, there are three types of cone cells, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths: short (S), medium (M), and long (L). These cones are responsible for detecting blue, green, and red light, respectively. Color blindness occurs when one or more of these cone types are absent or malfunctioning, leading to an inability to distinguish certain colors. The most common forms of color blindness are red-green color blindness, which is caused by a deficiency or malfunction in either the M or L cones, and blue-yellow color blindness, which is caused by a deficiency or malfunction in the S cones."
