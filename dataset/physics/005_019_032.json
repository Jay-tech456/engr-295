    "message_2": "To determine the phase difference between two light waves that interfere destructively at a certain point due to relativistic effects, we need to consider the Doppler effect for light waves. The Doppler effect causes a change in the frequency and wavelength of the light waves as observed by a moving observer relative to the source of light.\n\nLet's denote the velocity of the observer relative to the source of light as v, the speed of light as c, the rest wavelength of the light as λ₀, and the observed wavelength as λ.\n\nThe relativistic Doppler effect formula is given by:\n\nλ = λ₀ * sqrt((1 + (v/c))/(1 - (v/c)))\n\nNow, let's consider two light waves with the same rest wavelength λ₀ that interfere destructively. For destructive interference, the phase difference between the two waves must be an odd multiple of π (i.e., (2n + 1)π, where n is an integer).\n\nThe path difference between the two waves, Δx, can be related to the phase difference, Δφ, by the following equation:\n\nΔx = (λ/2π) * Δφ\n\nFor destructive interference, Δx must be equal to an odd multiple of half the observed wavelength (i.e., (2m + 1)λ/2, where m is an integer). Therefore, we have:\n\n(λ/2π) * Δφ = (2m + 1)λ/2\n\nSolving for the phase difference Δφ, we get:\n\nΔφ = (2m + 1)π\n\nSo, the phase difference between two light waves that interfere destructively at a certain point due to relativistic effects is an odd multiple of π, or (2m + 1)π, where m is an integer."
