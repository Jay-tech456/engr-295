    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of an excited state in an oxygen atom, we need to know the transition rate (A) between the excited state and the ground state. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem. However, we can still calculate the wavelength of the photon that will be emitted when the atom decays to its ground state.\n\nThe energy of the excited state is given as 4.80 eV. We can convert this energy to joules using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J:\n\nE = 4.80 eV * (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 7.6896 x 10^(-19) J\n\nWhen the atom decays to its ground state, it will emit a photon with this energy. We can use the energy of the photon to find its wavelength using the Planck's equation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (7.6896 x 10^(-19) J)\n\nλ = 2.582 x 10^(-7) m\n\nTo express the wavelength in nanometers, we can convert meters to nanometers (1 m = 10^9 nm):\n\nλ = 2.582 x 10^(-7) m * (10^9 nm/m) = 258.2 nm\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photon emitted when the oxygen atom decays to its ground state is approximately 258.2 nm."
