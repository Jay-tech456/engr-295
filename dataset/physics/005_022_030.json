    "message_2": "To find the electric field produced by a moving point charge, we need to consider the relativistic effects due to the high velocity (0.8c) of the charge. The electric field of a moving point charge is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which take into account the effects of special relativity.\n\nFor a point charge q moving with a velocity v = 0.8c, the electric field E at a position r in the observer's frame of reference is given by:\n\nE = (q / (4πε₀)) * [(n - β) / R² * (1 - β⋅n)³]\n\nHere,\nε₀ is the vacuum permittivity,\nn is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the position r,\nβ = v/c is the velocity of the charge in units of the speed of light,\nR is the distance from the charge to the position r,\nand β⋅n is the dot product of β and n.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the electric field produced by a stationary point charge. The electric field E_s of a stationary point charge q at a position r is given by Coulomb's law:\n\nE_s = (q / (4πε₀)) * (1 / R²)\n\nThe main difference between the electric fields produced by a moving and a stationary point charge is the presence of the relativistic factor (1 - β⋅n)³ in the denominator of the electric field expression for the moving charge. This factor accounts for the distortion of the electric field due to the motion of the charge. As the charge moves faster, the electric field becomes more concentrated in the direction perpendicular to the motion, and the field lines are compressed in the direction of motion. This is known as the relativistic beaming effect.\n\nIn summary, the electric field produced by a moving point charge with a velocity of 0.8c is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which include a relativistic factor that accounts for the distortion of the electric field due to the motion of the charge. This electric field is different from the electric field produced by a stationary point charge, which is given by Coulomb's law and does not include any relativistic effects."
