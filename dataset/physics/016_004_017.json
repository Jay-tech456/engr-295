    "message_2": "The critical magnetic field (Hc) required to cause a superconductor to lose its zero resistance state and become a normal conductor depends on the specific superconducting material and its temperature. The relationship between the critical magnetic field and temperature in a superconductor can be described by the empirical formula:\n\nHc(T) = Hc(0) * (1 - (T/Tc)^2)\n\nwhere:\n- Hc(T) is the critical magnetic field at temperature T,\n- Hc(0) is the critical magnetic field at absolute zero (0 K),\n- T is the temperature of the superconductor,\n- Tc is the critical temperature at which the superconductor transitions from the superconducting state to the normal state.\n\nThe critical magnetic field decreases as the temperature of the superconductor increases, approaching zero when the temperature reaches the critical temperature (Tc). At temperatures below Tc, the superconductor exhibits zero resistance and expels magnetic fields (Meissner effect). When the applied magnetic field exceeds the critical magnetic field (Hc) at a given temperature, the superconductor loses its superconducting properties and becomes a normal conductor.\n\nDifferent superconducting materials have different critical magnetic fields and critical temperatures. For example, the critical magnetic field for niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) at absolute zero is around 30 Tesla, while for lead (Pb), it is about 0.08 Tesla. The critical temperature for Nb3Sn is around 18.3 K, while for Pb, it is about 7.2 K.\n\nIn summary, the critical magnetic field required to cause a superconductor to lose its zero resistance state and become a normal conductor depends on the specific material and its temperature. The relationship between the critical magnetic field and temperature can be described by the empirical formula mentioned above."
