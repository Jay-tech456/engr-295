    "message_2": "In quantum teleportation, a pair of entangled qubits is used to transmit the state of a qubit from one location to another. The process involves the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) sharing an entangled pair of qubits, with Alice performing a joint measurement on her qubit and the qubit she wants to send. This measurement results in two classical bits of information, which Alice then sends to Bob. Bob uses this classical information to perform an operation on his entangled qubit, effectively reconstructing the original qubit state.\n\nSo, using a pair of entangled qubits in quantum teleportation, the maximum amount of classical information that can be transmitted is 2 bits.\n\nNow, if we replace the qubits with higher-dimensional entangled states, called qudits (where d is the dimension of the state), the amount of classical information that can be transmitted increases. In this case, Alice and Bob would share an entangled pair of qudits, and Alice would perform a joint measurement on her qudit and the qudit she wants to send. This measurement would result in log2(d^2) classical bits of information, which Alice would send to Bob. Bob would then use this classical information to perform an operation on his entangled qudit, reconstructing the original qudit state.\n\nIn summary, the maximum amount of classical information that can be transmitted through quantum teleportation using a pair of entangled qubits is 2 bits. This limit increases to log2(d^2) bits when using higher-dimensional entangled states (qudits)."
