    "message_2": "To determine the magnification and the distance of the image from the mirror, we can use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (u) is 30 cm, we can plug these values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v\n\nTo solve for v, we first find the common denominator of 20 and 30, which is 60. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3/60 = 2/60 + 1/v\n\nSubtracting 2/60 from both sides, we get:\n\n1/60 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to find the value of v:\n\nv = 60 cm\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is 60 cm from the mirror.\n\nNext, we can use the magnification formula to find the magnification (M) of the image:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u, we get:\n\nM = -60/30\n\nM = -2\n\nThe magnification of the image is -2, which means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object."
