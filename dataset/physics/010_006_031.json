    "message_2": "To calculate the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool, we can use the hydrostatic pressure formula:\n\nPressure = Density × Gravity × Depth\n\nwhere\nDensity (ρ) = 1000 kg/m^3 (density of water)\nGravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)\nDepth (h) = 2.5 m (depth of the swimming pool)\n\nPressure = 1000 kg/m^3 × 9.81 m/s^2 × 2.5 m\n\nPressure = 24525 Pa (Pascals)\n\nSo, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is 24,525 Pascals."
