    "message_1": "A particle called a meson has a mass of 2.1 GeV/c² and travels at nearly the speed of light. If the meson decays into two daughter particles, a muon and an anti-muon, calculate the energy of each daughter particle in the laboratory frame.",
    "message_2": "In the meson's rest frame, the decay is symmetric, and the muon and anti-muon will have equal energies. The energy of each daughter particle in the rest frame can be calculated using the conservation of energy and the mass-energy equivalence formula:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nwhere E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe mass of the meson is 2.1 GeV/c², so the total energy in the rest frame is:\n\nE_total = (2.1 GeV/c²) * c^2 = 2.1 GeV\n\nSince the decay is symmetric, the energy of each daughter particle in the rest frame is half of the total energy:\n\nE_daughter_rest = 0.5 * E_total = 0.5 * 2.1 GeV = 1.05 GeV\n\nNow, we need to transform the energy of the daughter particles from the rest frame to the laboratory frame. Since the meson is traveling at nearly the speed of light, we can use the relativistic energy transformation formula:\n\nE_lab = E_rest * γ\n\nwhere E_lab is the energy in the laboratory frame, E_rest is the energy in the rest frame, and γ is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the meson.\n\nSince the meson is traveling at nearly the speed of light, we can approximate γ as being very large. Therefore, the energy of each daughter particle in the laboratory frame will be significantly larger than in the rest frame:\n\nE_daughter_lab ≈ E_daughter_rest * γ\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of the meson's velocity, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the energy of each daughter particle in the laboratory frame. However, we can conclude that it will be significantly larger than 1.05 GeV due to the relativistic effects."
