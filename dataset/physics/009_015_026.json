Also, calculate the size of the image if the aperture of the mirror is 2 cm and the wavelength of light used is 600 nm. Take the refractive index of air to be 1.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance of the image for an object placed 10 cm away from the mirror, we can use the mirror formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nThe focal length (f) of the mirror can be calculated using the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2\n\nIn this case, R = 15 cm, so:\n\nf = 15 cm / 2 = 7.5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the mirror formula:\n\n1/7.5 = 1/(-10) + 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\n1/v = 1/7.5 + 1/10 = 1/7.5 + 1/10 = (2 + 1.5) / 15 = 3.5 / 15\n\nv = 15 / 3.5 = 30/7 = 4.29 cm (approximately)\n\nThe image distance (v) is approximately 4.29 cm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the size of the image. To do this, we can use the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nIn this case, u = -10 cm and v = 4.29 cm, so:\n\nM = -4.29 / (-10) = 0.429\n\nThe magnification (M) is 0.429.\n\nThe size of the image can be calculated using the aperture of the mirror (A) and the magnification:\n\nSize of the image = A * M\n\nIn this case, A = 2 cm, so:\n\nSize of the image = 2 cm * 0.429 = 0.858 cm\n\nThe size of the image is approximately 0.858 cm."
