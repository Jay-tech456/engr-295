    "message_1": "What is the energy difference between the initial and final states of an iron atom which undergoes the Auger effect, if the energy of the Auger electron emitted is found to be 710 eV? The atomic number of iron is 26.",
    "message_2": "In the Auger effect, an electron from a higher energy level fills a vacancy in a lower energy level, and the energy difference between these two levels is transferred to another electron, which is then emitted as an Auger electron. The energy of the Auger electron is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states of the atom.\n\nIn this case, the energy of the Auger electron is given as 710 eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the initial and final states of the iron atom is also 710 eV."
