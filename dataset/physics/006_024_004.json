    "message_2": "The cross section of a nuclear reaction is a measure of the probability that a specific reaction will occur when a neutron interacts with a nucleus. In the case of uranium-235 (U-235), the cross section for the fission reaction with a neutron varies with the energy of the neutron.\n\nFor thermal neutrons, which have relatively low energies (around 0.025 eV), the fission cross section of U-235 is quite large, approximately 580 barns (1 barn = 10^-28 m^2). This makes U-235 an excellent fuel for nuclear reactors, as it can easily sustain a chain reaction with slow-moving neutrons.\n\nAs the energy of the neutron increases, the fission cross section of U-235 generally decreases. For fast neutrons with energies in the range of 1 MeV, the cross section is reduced to around 1-2 barns. However, there are some resonances (peaks) in the cross section at specific neutron energies, where the probability of fission increases temporarily. These resonances are due to the quantum mechanical nature of nuclear reactions and are observed in many other nuclei as well.\n\nIn summary, the cross section of the nuclear reaction between a neutron and a nucleus of uranium-235 depends on the energy of the neutron, with a larger cross section for thermal neutrons and a generally smaller cross section for higher-energy neutrons, with some resonances at specific energies."
