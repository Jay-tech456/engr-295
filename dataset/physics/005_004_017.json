    "message_2": "To find the relativistic kinetic energy and momentum of the particle, we first need to determine its Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$\n\nwhere $v$ is the speed of the particle and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nNext, we can find the relativistic mass $m$ of the particle using the following equation:\n\n$$m = \\gamma m_0$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the relativistic kinetic energy $K$ using the following formula:\n\n$$K = (\\gamma - 1)m_0c^2$$\n\nFinally, we can find the relativistic momentum $p$ using the following equation:\n\n$$p = m v = \\gamma m_0 v$$\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy and momentum of the particle are given by:\n\n$$K = (\\gamma - 1)m_0c^2$$\n\n$$p = \\gamma m_0 v$$"
