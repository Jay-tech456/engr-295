    "message_2": "To calculate the separation between the Zeeman sub-levels, we need to consider the Zeeman effect, which is the splitting of energy levels in the presence of an external magnetic field. In this case, we are considering the electron's spin to be parallel to the field direction.\n\nThe energy shift due to the Zeeman effect can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy shift, μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), B is the magnetic field strength (0.5 T), and m_j is the total angular momentum quantum number.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the total angular momentum quantum number (m_j) can be calculated as the sum of the orbital angular momentum quantum number (m_l) and the spin angular momentum quantum number (m_s). In this case, we are considering the transition from n=2 to n=1, which corresponds to the Balmer-alpha line at 656.3 nm.\n\nFor n=2, l=0 or 1, and for n=1, l=0. Since the electron's spin is parallel to the field direction, m_s = +1/2. Therefore, we have the following possible values for m_j:\n\n1. m_j = m_l + m_s = 0 + 1/2 = 1/2\n2. m_j = m_l + m_s = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy shift for each m_j value:\n\n1. ΔE_1 = μ_B * B * (1/2) = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * (1/2) = 2.3185 x 10^-24 J\n2. ΔE_2 = μ_B * B * (3/2) = (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (0.5 T) * (3/2) = 6.9555 x 10^-24 J\n\nThe separation between the Zeeman sub-levels is the difference between these energy shifts:\n\nΔE_sep = ΔE_2 - ΔE_1 = 6.9555 x 10^-24 J - 2.3185 x 10^-24 J = 4.637 x 10^-24 J\n\nSo, the separation between the Zeeman sub-levels for the hydrogen atom in an external magnetic field of 0.5 T, with the electron's spin parallel to the field direction, and the transition from n=2 to n=1 (Balmer-alpha line at 656.3 nm) is approximately 4.637 x 10^-24 J."
