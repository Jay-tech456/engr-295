    "message_2": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrinos are elementary particles that interact with matter primarily through the weak nuclear force. The probability of a neutrino interacting with matter is quantified by its cross-section, which is a measure of the likelihood of a specific interaction occurring. The cross-section depends on the energy of the neutrino and the type of interaction (charged current or neutral current).\n\nThe relationship between the energy of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the probabilities of their interaction with matter is that as the energy of the neutrino increases, its cross-section (and thus the probability of interaction) also increases. This is because higher-energy neutrinos have a higher probability of interacting with the particles in matter (such as quarks inside protons and neutrons) via the weak force.\n\nTo calculate the interaction probabilities for different neutrino energies using the Standard Model, one would need to compute the cross-sections for the relevant processes. For neutrinos, the main processes are charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions. In CC interactions, a neutrino interacts with a quark inside a nucleon (proton or neutron) and transforms into a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau), while in NC interactions, a neutrino interacts with a quark but remains a neutrino.\n\nThe cross-sections for these processes can be calculated using the formalism of quantum field theory and the electroweak theory, which is a part of the Standard Model. These calculations involve integrating over the possible final states and summing over the possible initial states, taking into account the relevant coupling constants, propagators, and other factors.\n\nFor high-energy cosmic neutrinos, the cross-sections can be approximated using the following formulae:\n\nσ_CC(E_ν) ≈ 7.63 × 10^(-36) cm² (E_ν / GeV)\nσ_NC(E_ν) ≈ 2.54 × 10^(-36) cm² (E_ν / GeV)\n\nwhere E_ν is the energy of the neutrino in GeV, and σ_CC and σ_NC are the charged current and neutral current cross-sections, respectively.\n\nThese formulae are valid for neutrino energies in the range of 10^2 to 10^8 GeV. For lower or higher energies, more precise calculations are needed, taking into account the detailed structure of the nucleon and the electroweak theory.\n\nIt's important to note that even though the cross-section increases with energy, high-energy cosmic neutrinos still have a very low probability of interacting with matter due to the extremely weak nature of the weak force. This is why neutrinos are often called \"ghost particles\" and can travel vast distances through the universe without being detected."
