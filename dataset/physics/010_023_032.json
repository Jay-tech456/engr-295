    "message_2": "Given the depth (h) of the ocean is 1000 meters, the density (ρ) of seawater is 1025 kg/m³, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s², we can calculate the pressure (P) at the bottom of the ocean using the equation P = ρgh.\n\nP = (1025 kg/m³) × (9.8 m/s²) × (1000 m)\n\nP = 1025 × 9.8 × 1000\n\nP = 10045000 kg m²/s² m³\n\nSince 1 Pascal (Pa) is equal to 1 kg m²/s² m³, the pressure at the bottom of the ocean is:\n\nP = 10045000 Pa\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the ocean is 10,045,000 Pascals."
