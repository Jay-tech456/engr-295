    "message_2": "There are several possible explanations for the discrepancy between the measured gravitational effects in the universe and the visible matter present. Some of the main hypotheses include:\n\n1. Dark Matter: Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. It is believed to make up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. The presence of dark matter can explain the observed gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nTo test the dark matter hypothesis, scientists are conducting experiments to directly detect dark matter particles, such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), through underground detectors like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Xenon1T experiment. Indirect detection methods, like observing the gamma rays produced by dark matter annihilation, are also being employed.\n\n2. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): MOND is an alternative theory to dark matter, proposing that the laws of gravity need to be modified at large scales to account for the observed discrepancies. This theory suggests that the gravitational force becomes stronger at low accelerations, which could explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter.\n\nTo test MOND, scientists can compare its predictions with observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. If MOND can accurately predict these phenomena without the need for dark matter, it could provide a viable alternative explanation.\n\n3. Dark Energy: Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that is believed to make up about 68% of the universe's mass-energy content. It is thought to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. While dark energy does not directly explain the discrepancy between gravitational effects and visible matter, it plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe's composition and evolution.\n\nTo test the dark energy hypothesis, scientists are studying the expansion history of the universe through observations of supernovae, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. Experiments like the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Euclid mission aim to provide more precise measurements of dark energy's properties and effects on the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the discrepancy between the measured gravitational effects in the universe and the visible matter present can be explained by several hypotheses, including dark matter, MOND, and dark energy. Testing these explanations through experiments and observations will help us better understand the nature of these mysterious components of the universe."
