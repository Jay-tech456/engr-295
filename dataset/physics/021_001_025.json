    "message_2": "The three main types of black holes are stellar-mass black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes. They form and evolve in different ways:\n\n1. Stellar-mass black holes: These black holes typically have masses between 3 and 20 times the mass of our Sun. They form when a massive star (at least 3 times the mass of the Sun) reaches the end of its life cycle. As the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer produce enough energy to support its own weight, leading to a gravitational collapse. The core of the star collapses under its own gravity, and if the core's mass is high enough, it will form a black hole. The outer layers of the star are expelled in a supernova explosion. Stellar-mass black holes can also form through the collision and merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole.\n\n2. Intermediate-mass black holes: These black holes have masses between 100 and 10,000 times the mass of the Sun. Their formation is not as well understood as that of stellar-mass black holes. One possible formation mechanism is the collision and merger of several stellar-mass black holes in dense star clusters. Another possibility is the direct collapse of a massive star or a dense cloud of gas without going through a supernova explosion.\n\n3. Supermassive black holes: These black holes have masses ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. They are found at the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way. The formation of supermassive black holes is still a topic of ongoing research. One theory suggests that they formed from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe. Another theory proposes that they grew over time through the accretion of gas and the merger of smaller black holes.\n\nOver time, black holes can grow by accreting mass from their surroundings or by merging with other black holes. They can also lose mass through a process called Hawking radiation, although this effect is negligible for astrophysical black holes. The evolution of black holes is closely tied to the evolution of their host galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe."
