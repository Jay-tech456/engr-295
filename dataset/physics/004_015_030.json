    "message_2": "Dark matter is a form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes that detect electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light, radio waves, or X-rays. The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThe current understanding of the composition and properties of dark matter is based on a combination of experimental evidence and theoretical models. In the framework of General Relativity, dark matter is assumed to be composed of non-baryonic particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter, primarily through gravity.\n\nSeveral candidates for dark matter particles have been proposed, including:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): These are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and have masses in the range of 10 to 10,000 times the mass of a proton. WIMPs are a popular candidate for dark matter because they naturally arise in some extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry.\n\n2. Axions: These are hypothetical particles that were originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Axions are much lighter than WIMPs and interact even more weakly with ordinary matter, making them difficult to detect experimentally.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: These are hypothetical particles that do not interact with ordinary matter through the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrinos. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the dark matter density.\n\nDespite extensive experimental searches, no direct detection of dark matter particles has been made so far. Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from various astrophysical observations, such as:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: The observed rotation curves of galaxies show that their outer regions rotate faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxies.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies by the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, provides evidence for the presence of dark matter. The observed lensing effects cannot be accounted for by the visible matter alone.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation provide information about the density of matter in the early universe. The observed fluctuations are consistent with a universe composed of approximately 27% dark matter, 5% ordinary matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n4. Large-scale structure of the universe: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales can be explained by the presence of dark matter, which acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that holds these structures together.\n\nIn conclusion, the current understanding of dark matter is based on a combination of experimental evidence and theoretical models within the framework of General Relativity. While the exact composition and properties of dark matter remain unknown, several particle candidates have been proposed, and ongoing experimental searches aim to shed light on this mysterious component of the universe."
