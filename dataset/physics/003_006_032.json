    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil carrying a current, we can use the formula:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * R)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current in amperes, and R is the radius of the coil in meters.\n\nGiven the current I = 6 A and the radius R = 10 cm (0.1 m), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 6 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)\n\nB = (24π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / 0.2 m\n\nB = 120π × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nB ≈ 3.77 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the center of the circular coil is approximately 3.77 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla)."
