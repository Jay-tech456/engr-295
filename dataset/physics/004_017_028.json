    "message_2": "To calculate the deflection angle of light by a gravitational lens, we can use the formula derived from the theory of General Relativity:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere α is the deflection angle, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the lens, c is the speed of light, and b is the impact parameter (the distance of closest approach of the light to the lens).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the lens from solar masses to kilograms. The mass of one solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the lens (M) is:\n\nM = 10^14 solar masses * (1.989 x 10^30 kg/solar mass) = 1.989 x 10^44 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the impact parameter (b). Since the lens is located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, we can assume that the light is passing very close to the lens. Therefore, we can approximate the impact parameter as the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon of a black hole) of the lens:\n\nb ≈ 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nb ≈ 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.989 x 10^44 kg) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nb ≈ 5.906 x 10^15 m\n\nNow we can calculate the deflection angle α:\n\nα = (4 * G * M) / (c^2 * b)\nα = (4 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3/kg s^2) * (1.989 x 10^44 kg)) / ((2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * (5.906 x 10^15 m))\nα ≈ 1.097 x 10^-8 radians\n\nTo convert the deflection angle to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 radian ≈ 206,265 arcseconds:\n\nα ≈ 1.097 x 10^-8 radians * (206,265 arcseconds/radian)\nα ≈ 2.261 x 10^-3 arcseconds\n\nSo, the predicted deflection angle of light by a gravitational lens with a mass of 10^14 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, according to the theory of General Relativity, is approximately 2.261 x 10^-3 arcseconds."
