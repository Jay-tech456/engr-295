    "message_2": "To find the period of a neutron star spinning at a rate of 600 revolutions per second, we need to calculate the time it takes for the star to complete one full revolution.\n\nThe period (T) is the reciprocal of the frequency (f), which is the number of revolutions per second. In this case, the frequency is 600 revolutions per second.\n\nT = 1 / f\n\nT = 1 / 600 s⁻¹\n\nT ≈ 0.0016667 seconds\n\nSo, the period of a neutron star spinning at a rate of 600 revolutions per second is approximately 0.0016667 seconds or 1.67 milliseconds."
