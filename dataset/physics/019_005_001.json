    "message_2": "The process of electron-positron annihilation through the emission of a single photon is a rare and highly suppressed process. In the Standard Model of particle physics, this process is forbidden at the tree level due to the conservation of angular momentum and charge. However, it can occur at higher orders through loop diagrams involving virtual particles, such as the exchange of a virtual photon or Z boson.\n\nThe decay rate (also known as the cross-section) for this process, denoted as σ(e+e- → γ), depends on the center-of-mass energy of the collision, denoted as √s. The cross-section can be calculated using perturbation theory and the techniques of quantum field theory. The leading-order contribution comes from the one-loop diagrams, which involve the exchange of a virtual photon or Z boson.\n\nThe cross-section for this process is given by:\n\nσ(e+e- → γ) ≈ α^3 / (2πs),\n\nwhere α is the fine-structure constant (approximately equal to 1/137), and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\nAs you can see from this formula, the cross-section decreases as the center-of-mass energy increases. This is because the process becomes more suppressed at higher energies due to the conservation laws mentioned earlier. Additionally, the cross-section is proportional to the cube of the fine-structure constant, which is a small number, indicating that this process is indeed rare.\n\nIt's important to note that this formula is a rough approximation and more accurate calculations would involve higher-order corrections and a more detailed analysis of the loop diagrams. However, this should give you a general idea of how the decay rate for electron-positron annihilation through the emission of a single photon varies with the center-of-mass energy of the collision."
