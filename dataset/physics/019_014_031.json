    "message_2": "The topological charge of a quantized vortex in a 2+1 dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) described by a complex scalar field theory can be calculated using the winding number. The winding number is a topological invariant that represents the number of times the phase of the order parameter winds around the vortex core.\n\nLet's consider a BEC described by a complex scalar field ψ(r, t), where r is the position vector in two spatial dimensions and t is time. The order parameter of the BEC is given by:\n\nΨ(r, t) = |Ψ(r, t)| * exp(iθ(r, t))\n\nHere, |Ψ(r, t)| is the amplitude of the condensate wavefunction, and θ(r, t) is the phase. The topological charge of a quantized vortex is given by the winding number n, which can be calculated as:\n\nn = (1 / 2π) * ∮ dθ\n\nwhere the integral is taken over a closed path around the vortex core.\n\nTo calculate the winding number, we need to find the gradient of the phase:\n\n∇θ(r, t) = (∂θ/∂x, ∂θ/∂y)\n\nNow, we can express the line integral in terms of the gradient of the phase:\n\nn = (1 / 2π) * ∮ (∇θ(r, t) • dl)\n\nwhere dl is the differential length along the closed path.\n\nUsing Stokes' theorem, we can convert the line integral into a surface integral:\n\nn = (1 / 2π) * ∬ (∇ × (∇θ(r, t))) • dA\n\nwhere dA is the differential area element.\n\nSince the curl of a gradient is zero, the surface integral vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core. Thus, the winding number n is an integer value that represents the topological charge of the vortex.\n\nThe physical significance of the topological charge is that it quantifies the circulation of the superfluid velocity around the vortex core. The superfluid velocity is given by:\n\nv_s = (ħ / m) * ∇θ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m is the mass of the particles in the condensate.\n\nThe circulation Γ around the vortex core is given by:\n\nΓ = ∮ v_s • dl = (ħ / m) * ∮ (∇θ(r, t) • dl) = 2π * (ħ / m) * n\n\nThus, the topological charge n determines the quantization of circulation in the BEC, which is a direct consequence of the quantization of angular momentum in quantum mechanics."
