    "message_1": "A metal plate is being heated uniformly from below by a flame, causing a convection current to rise up the plate. The plate is 2 cm thick, 20 cm wide, and 30 cm long. The initial temperature of the plate is 20°C and its thermal conductivity is 50 W/mK. The heat transfer coefficient between the plate and the surrounding fluid is 100 W/m²K. If the flame heat input is 500 W/m² and is applied to one side of the plate, how long will it take for the temperature at the other surface of the plate to reach 90°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the lumped capacitance method, which assumes that the temperature within the solid is uniform at any given time. This method is applicable when the Biot number (Bi) is less than 0.1. The Biot number is given by:\n\nBi = hL/k\n\nwhere h is the heat transfer coefficient, L is the characteristic length (thickness of the plate), and k is the thermal conductivity.\n\nFirst, let's convert the dimensions to meters:\n\nThickness (L) = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nWidth = 20 cm = 0.2 m\nLength = 30 cm = 0.3 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the Biot number:\n\nBi = (100 W/m²K)(0.02 m) / (50 W/mK) = 0.04\n\nSince Bi < 0.1, we can use the lumped capacitance method.\n\nThe lumped capacitance method uses the following equation to determine the time required to reach a certain temperature:\n\nt = (ρVc)(T - T_initial) / Q\n\nwhere t is the time, ρ is the density of the material, V is the volume of the material, c is the specific heat capacity, T is the final temperature, T_initial is the initial temperature, and Q is the heat input.\n\nWe are not given the density and specific heat capacity of the metal, so we cannot calculate the exact time. However, we can set up the equation with the given information:\n\nt = (ρVc)(90°C - 20°C) / (500 W/m² × 0.2 m × 0.3 m)\n\nt = (ρVc)(70°C) / (30 W)\n\nIf we had the density and specific heat capacity of the metal, we could plug those values into the equation and solve for t."
