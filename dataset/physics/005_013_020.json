    "message_1": "A particle with a rest mass of 2 electron masses is moving at a speed of 0.75c. It collides head-on with a particle of rest mass 5 electron masses moving at a speed of 0.4c in the opposite direction. What is the total energy of the two particles after the collision in comparison to the total energy of the two particles before the collision?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the relativistic mass of each particle, then find their individual energies before the collision, and finally, find the total energy before and after the collision.\n\n1. Find the relativistic mass of each particle:\n\nThe relativistic mass (m) is given by the formula m = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor particle 1 (rest mass = 2 electron masses, v = 0.75c):\nm1 = 2 / sqrt(1 - (0.75c)^2/c^2) = 2 / sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = 2 / sqrt(0.4375) = 2 / 0.6614 = 3.023 electron masses\n\nFor particle 2 (rest mass = 5 electron masses, v = 0.4c):\nm2 = 5 / sqrt(1 - (0.4c)^2/c^2) = 5 / sqrt(1 - 0.16) = 5 / sqrt(0.84) = 5 / 0.9165 = 5.455 electron masses\n\n2. Find the individual energies before the collision:\n\nThe relativistic energy (E) is given by the formula E = mc^2, where m is the relativistic mass and c is the speed of light.\n\nFor particle 1:\nE1 = (3.023 electron masses) * (c^2) = 3.023 * 0.511 MeV = 1.545 MeV\n\nFor particle 2:\nE2 = (5.455 electron masses) * (c^2) = 5.455 * 0.511 MeV = 2.788 MeV\n\n3. Find the total energy before the collision:\n\nE_total_before = E1 + E2 = 1.545 MeV + 2.788 MeV = 4.333 MeV\n\n4. Find the total energy after the collision:\n\nSince energy is conserved in a collision, the total energy after the collision will be the same as the total energy before the collision.\n\nE_total_after = E_total_before = 4.333 MeV\n\n5. Compare the total energy before and after the collision:\n\nThe total energy of the two particles after the collision is the same as the total energy of the two particles before the collision, which is 4.333 MeV."
