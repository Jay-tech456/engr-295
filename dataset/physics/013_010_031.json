    "message_2": "When another massive object passes nearby a planet, the orbit of the planet can be affected due to the gravitational interaction between the two objects. The extent of the change in the planet's orbit depends on factors such as the mass of the passing object, the distance between the two objects, and their relative velocities.\n\nHere's a general overview of how the orbit of a planet can change when another massive object passes nearby:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: As the massive object approaches the planet, the gravitational force between the two objects increases. This force can cause the planet to accelerate towards the massive object, altering the planet's velocity and trajectory.\n\n2. Orbital perturbation: The change in the planet's velocity and trajectory can cause its orbit to become perturbed. This means that the shape, size, and orientation of the planet's orbit can be altered. The perturbation can manifest as a change in the eccentricity (how elliptical the orbit is), the semi-major axis (the average distance between the planet and its central body), or the inclination (the angle between the planet's orbit and a reference plane).\n\n3. Close encounters: If the massive object passes very close to the planet, the gravitational interaction can cause significant changes in the planet's orbit, potentially leading to unstable orbits or even ejections from the planetary system.\n\n4. Tidal effects: The gravitational force between the planet and the massive object can also cause tidal effects, which can lead to the transfer of angular momentum and energy between the two objects. This can result in changes to the planet's rotation and orbital properties.\n\n5. Post-encounter: After the massive object has passed by the planet, the gravitational force between the two objects decreases, and the planet's orbit may settle into a new stable configuration. Depending on the specifics of the encounter, the planet's orbit may be only slightly altered, or it could be significantly changed.\n\nIn summary, the orbit of a planet can change when another massive object passes nearby due to gravitational interactions between the two objects. The extent of the change depends on various factors, including the mass of the passing object, the distance between the two objects, and their relative velocities. The planet's orbit may be perturbed, leading to changes in its shape, size, and orientation, and in some cases, the planet may even be ejected from its planetary system."
