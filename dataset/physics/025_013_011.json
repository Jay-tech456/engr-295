    "message_2": "The perception of color in the human eye is primarily determined by the physical properties of light, specifically its wavelength and frequency. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the lens, and then reaches the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting light and converting it into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.\n\nThere are two main types of photoreceptors in the human eye: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to light and are responsible for vision in low-light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and function best in well-lit environments. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths, corresponding to the colors red, green, and blue.\n\nThe wavelength and frequency of light are inversely related, meaning that as the wavelength of light increases, its frequency decreases, and vice versa. The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm in wavelength, with violet light at the shorter end and red light at the longer end of the spectrum.\n\nWhen light of a specific wavelength enters the eye, it stimulates the cones that are sensitive to that range of wavelengths. For example, light with a wavelength of around 700 nm will primarily stimulate the red-sensitive cones, while light with a wavelength of around 450 nm will stimulate the blue-sensitive cones. The brain then processes the signals from these cones to create the perception of color.\n\nIn summary, the physical properties of light, such as wavelength and frequency, play a crucial role in the perception of color in the human eye. Different wavelengths of light stimulate different types of cone cells in the retina, which then send signals to the brain to create the perception of various colors."
