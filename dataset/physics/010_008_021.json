    "message_2": "To find the weight of the ball when immersed in water, we need to first find the buoyant force acting on the ball due to the water.\n\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. \n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the metal ball:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\nMass = Density * Volume\n\nGiven the density of the metal ball is 8,000 kg/m³, we need to convert the volume from cm³ to m³:\n\n500 cm³ = 500 * (10^(-6)) m³ = 5 * 10^(-4) m³\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the ball:\n\nMass = 8,000 kg/m³ * 5 * 10^(-4) m³ = 4 kg\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the water displaced by the ball. The volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the ball, which is 5 * 10^(-4) m³. The density of water is approximately 1,000 kg/m³.\n\nMass of water displaced = Density of water * Volume of water displaced\nMass of water displaced = 1,000 kg/m³ * 5 * 10^(-4) m³ = 0.5 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the water displaced, which is equal to the buoyant force:\n\nWeight of water displaced = Mass of water displaced * g (acceleration due to gravity)\nWeight of water displaced = 0.5 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 4.905 N\n\nNow, according to Archimedes' principle, the weight of the ball when immersed in water is equal to the weight of the ball in air minus the buoyant force:\n\nWeight of ball in water = Weight of ball in air - Buoyant force\nWeight of ball in water = 20 N - 4.905 N = 15.095 N\n\nSo, the weight of the ball when immersed in water is approximately 15.095 N."
