    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the merger of two black holes, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Frequency (f): f = 1/(2 * pi * t)\n2. Amplitude (h): h = (4 * G * M * c) / (d * r)\n\nWhere:\n- t is the merge time (0.1 seconds)\n- G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\n- M is the total mass of the black holes (30 million + 20 million times the mass of the sun)\n- c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)\n- d is the orbital separation (400 km)\n- r is the distance from the observer to the black holes (we will assume a distance of 1 Gpc or 3.086 x 10^22 m)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the frequency:\n\nf = 1/(2 * pi * 0.1)\nf ≈ 1.5915 Hz\n\nNow, let's calculate the amplitude:\n\nM = (30 million + 20 million) * (1.989 x 10^30 kg)\nM ≈ 9.945 x 10^37 kg\n\nd = 400 km * 1000 (convert to meters)\nd = 4 x 10^5 m\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 x 10^-11 * 9.945 x 10^37 * 2.998 x 10^8) / (4 x 10^5 * 3.086 x 10^22)\nh ≈ 2.694 x 10^-21\n\nSo, the frequency of the gravitational waves emitted during the merger of the two black holes is approximately 1.5915 Hz, and the amplitude is approximately 2.694 x 10^-21."
