    "message_2": "To calculate the drag force acting on the ball, we can use Stokes' Law for small spherical objects moving through a viscous fluid at low velocities. Stokes' Law states that the drag force (F_d) is given by:\n\nF_d = 6πηrv\n\nwhere η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, r is the radius of the sphere, and v is the terminal velocity of the sphere.\n\nGiven the dynamic viscosity (η) of 0.01 Pa∙s, the radius (r) of 0.1 m (10 cm), and the terminal velocity (v) of 0.1 m/s, we can calculate the drag force (F_d):\n\nF_d = 6π(0.01 Pa∙s)(0.1 m)(0.1 m/s)\nF_d = 6π(0.0001 Pa∙m²/s)\nF_d ≈ 0.001884 Pa∙m²/s\n\nThe drag force acting on the ball is approximately 0.001884 Pa∙m²/s or 1.884 mN (millinewtons)."
