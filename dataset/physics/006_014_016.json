    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an excited hydrogen atom in the n=3 state decaying to the ground state within 10 nanoseconds, we first need to find the lifetime of the excited state and the decay rate.\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of an excited state can be calculated using the formula:\n\nτ = 1 / Γ\n\nwhere Γ is the decay rate.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom in the n=3 state, the decay rate (Γ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΓ = A_32 + A_31\n\nwhere A_32 is the spontaneous emission rate from the n=3 state to the n=2 state, and A_31 is the spontaneous emission rate from the n=3 state to the n=1 (ground) state.\n\nThe values of A_32 and A_31 can be found using the following formulas:\n\nA_32 = (64π^4e^8)/(3h^3c^3) * (1/n_3^2 - 1/n_2^2)^3 * (1/n_2^2)\nA_31 = (64π^4e^8)/(3h^3c^3) * (1/n_3^2 - 1/n_1^2)^3 * (1/n_1^2)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and n_1, n_2, and n_3 are the principal quantum numbers of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state, respectively.\n\nUsing the given values, we can calculate A_32 and A_31:\n\nA_32 ≈ 0.068 s^(-1)\nA_31 ≈ 0.016 s^(-1)\n\nNow, we can find the decay rate (Γ):\n\nΓ = A_32 + A_31 ≈ 0.084 s^(-1)\n\nNext, we can find the lifetime (τ) of the excited state:\n\nτ = 1 / Γ ≈ 11.9 ns\n\nNow that we have the lifetime, we can calculate the probability of the hydrogen atom decaying to the ground state within 10 ns. The probability of decay is given by the following formula:\n\nP(t) = 1 - exp(-t/τ)\n\nwhere t is the time interval (10 ns in this case).\n\nP(10 ns) = 1 - exp(-10 ns / 11.9 ns) ≈ 0.58\n\nSo, the probability of an excited hydrogen atom in the n=3 state decaying to the ground state within 10 nanoseconds is approximately 58%."
