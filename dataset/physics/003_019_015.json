    "message_1": "A coaxial cable with radius R1 = 1 cm and radius R2 = 5 cm carries a current I = 5 A. Determine the magnetic field at a distance of r = 2 cm from the center of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance r = 2 cm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, the magnetic field is in the azimuthal direction (circumferential direction) and is symmetrical around the center of the cable. Therefore, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius r = 2 cm.\n\nSince r is between R1 and R2, the current enclosed by the Amperian loop is the same as the total current I, which is 5 A. The length of the Amperian loop is the circumference of the circle with radius r, which is 2πr.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for this situation:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nWe need to solve for B:\n\nB = μ₀I / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Now, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.04π m)\n\nB = 5 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of r = 2 cm from the center of the cable is 5 × 10^(-6) T (tesla)."
