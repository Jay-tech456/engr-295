    "message_2": "Magnetic susceptibility (χ) is a dimensionless quantity that indicates the degree to which a material can be magnetized in an external magnetic field. For iron, a ferromagnetic material, the magnetic susceptibility is quite high.\n\nAt room temperature (around 20°C or 293 K), the magnetic susceptibility of iron is approximately 5000 (in SI units). However, this value can vary depending on the specific type and purity of the iron sample.\n\nAs the temperature increases, the magnetic susceptibility of iron decreases. This is because the thermal energy causes increased random motion of the atoms, which disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains within the material. Eventually, at a certain temperature called the Curie temperature (Tc), the ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetism and becomes paramagnetic. For iron, the Curie temperature is around 770°C (1043 K).\n\nIn the case of iron, the relationship between magnetic susceptibility and temperature can be approximately described by the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nχ(T) = C / (T - Tc)\n\nwhere χ(T) is the magnetic susceptibility at temperature T, C is the Curie constant, and Tc is the Curie temperature. This equation is more applicable when the temperature is close to or above the Curie temperature. Below the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility remains relatively high and does not follow the Curie-Weiss law as closely."
