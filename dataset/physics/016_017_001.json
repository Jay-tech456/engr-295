    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in a high-temperature superconductor coil, we need to calculate the magnetic energy stored in the coil. The magnetic energy density (energy per unit volume) in a magnetic field is given by the formula:\n\nu = (1/2) * B^2 / μ₀\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, and μ₀ is the permeability of free space (μ₀ ≈ 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A).\n\nThe critical magnetic field is given as B_c = 10 T. Therefore, the maximum magnetic energy density in the coil is:\n\nu_max = (1/2) * (10 T)^2 / (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A)\nu_max ≈ 4 × 10^5 J/m³\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of the coil. The coil has a length L = 10 m and a diameter d = 1 m, so the radius is r = d/2 = 0.5 m. The volume of the coil is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2L\nV = π(0.5 m)^2(10 m)\nV ≈ 7.85 m³\n\nNow, we can find the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the coil by multiplying the maximum magnetic energy density by the volume of the coil:\n\nE_max = u_max * V\nE_max ≈ (4 × 10^5 J/m³)(7.85 m³)\nE_max ≈ 3.14 × 10^6 J\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the high-temperature superconductor coil is approximately 3.14 × 10^6 Joules."
