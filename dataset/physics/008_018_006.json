Provide a detailed explanation of the theoretical framework and the mathematical formulas involved in this process.",
    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a fundamental parameter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong nuclear force between quarks and gluons. The experimental method used to measure the strong coupling constant is called deep inelastic scattering (DIS).\n\nDeep inelastic scattering involves firing high-energy electrons or muons at protons or neutrons, causing the exchange of virtual photons with the quarks inside the target nucleons. By analyzing the scattered particles, we can probe the internal structure of the nucleons and extract information about the strong force.\n\nThe strong coupling constant is related to the asymptotic freedom of strong interactions, which is a key feature of QCD. Asymptotic freedom refers to the fact that the strong force becomes weaker at smaller distances (or higher energies). This behavior is opposite to the electromagnetic force, where the force becomes stronger at smaller distances. Asymptotic freedom allows quarks and gluons to behave almost as free particles at very high energies, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of particles in high-energy experiments and the early universe.\n\nThe theoretical framework for measuring αs involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cross-section for deep inelastic scattering using perturbative QCD, which is an approximation method that treats the strong force as a series of weak interactions. This calculation involves summing over Feynman diagrams and using the renormalization group equations to account for the running of the coupling constant.\n\n2. Compare the calculated cross-section with experimental data from electron-proton or muon-proton scattering experiments, such as those performed at the HERA collider. By fitting the theoretical predictions to the data, we can extract the value of the strong coupling constant.\n\n3. The strong coupling constant depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, so we need to evolve the extracted value to a common reference scale, typically the mass of the Z boson (MZ). This is done using the renormalization group equations, which describe how αs changes with energy.\n\nThe mathematical formula for the running of the strong coupling constant is given by:\n\nαs(μ) = αs(μ₀) / (1 + (b₀ * αs(μ₀) / (2π)) * ln(μ² / μ₀²))\n\nwhere μ is the energy scale, μ₀ is the reference energy scale, αs(μ₀) is the strong coupling constant at the reference scale, and b₀ is the first coefficient of the QCD beta function, which depends on the number of active quark flavors.\n\nBy combining results from different experiments and using the renormalization group equations, we can obtain a precise determination of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass, which is currently αs(MZ) ≈ 0.1181. This value is essential for making accurate predictions in particle physics and understanding the behavior of the strong force."
