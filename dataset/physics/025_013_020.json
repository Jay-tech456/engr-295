    "message_2": "The wavelength of light plays a crucial role in human visual perception, as it determines the colors we perceive. The human eye contains photoreceptor cells called cones and rods, which are responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain for interpretation. Cones are responsible for color vision, while rods are responsible for low-light vision.\n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the human retina, each sensitive to a specific range of wavelengths. These cone cells are classified as:\n\n1. S-cones (short-wavelength cones): These cones are sensitive to short wavelengths, typically around 420 nm, and are responsible for perceiving blue colors.\n\n2. M-cones (medium-wavelength cones): These cones are sensitive to medium wavelengths, typically around 530 nm, and are responsible for perceiving green colors.\n\n3. L-cones (long-wavelength cones): These cones are sensitive to long wavelengths, typically around 560 nm, and are responsible for perceiving red colors.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the lens and falls on the retina, where it activates the photoreceptor cells. The activation of these cells depends on the wavelength of the incoming light. For instance, if the incoming light has a wavelength of around 420 nm, it will primarily activate the S-cones, resulting in the perception of blue color.\n\nThe activation of these cone cells generates electrical signals, which are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals and interprets them as colors based on the specific combination of cone cells activated. For example, if both M-cones and L-cones are activated, the brain will interpret the color as yellow.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light affects visual perception in humans by activating specific photoreceptor cells in the retina, which are sensitive to different wavelengths. This activation results in the generation of electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, where they are interpreted as colors based on the specific combination of activated cone cells."
