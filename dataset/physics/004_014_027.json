    "message_2": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is a relic radiation from the early universe, which is now observed as a nearly uniform glow of microwave radiation across the entire sky. The temperature of the CMB is approximately 2.725 Kelvin (K), which is just a few degrees above absolute zero.\n\nThe origin of the CMB dates back to around 380,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe was in a hot, dense state. At that time, the universe had cooled down enough for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process is known as recombination. Before recombination, the universe was opaque, as photons were constantly scattered by free electrons. However, after recombination, the universe became transparent, allowing photons to travel freely through space. These photons have been traveling through the universe ever since, and we now observe them as the CMB radiation.\n\nThe CMB provides crucial information about the early universe, including:\n\n1. Confirmation of the Big Bang Theory: The existence of the CMB radiation supports the idea that the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n2. Age of the Universe: By studying the CMB, scientists have been able to estimate the age of the universe to be approximately 13.8 billion years old.\n\n3. Composition of the Universe: The CMB has allowed scientists to determine the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. Current estimates suggest that around 5% of the universe is made up of ordinary matter, 27% is dark matter, and 68% is dark energy.\n\n4. Large-Scale Structure of the Universe: The tiny fluctuations in the CMB's temperature provide information about the initial density fluctuations in the early universe, which eventually led to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\n5. Testing Cosmological Models: The precise measurements of the CMB have helped scientists test and refine various cosmological models, leading to a better understanding of the universe's history and evolution."
