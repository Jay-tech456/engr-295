    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point located 10 cm away from the center of the sphere, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, it is important to note that a uniformly charged sphere does not produce a magnetic field due to its charge distribution. The magnetic field is only produced due to the current flowing through the sphere.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field (dB) produced by a small current element (Idl) at a point P is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (Idl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a uniformly charged sphere carrying a current, we can assume that the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere. To find the total magnetic field at the point 10 cm away from the center, we need to integrate the magnetic field produced by each small current element over the entire surface of the sphere.\n\nHowever, due to the symmetry of the problem, we can see that the magnetic field produced by the current elements on opposite sides of the sphere will cancel each other out. This is because the magnetic field produced by each current element is perpendicular to the plane formed by the current element and the point P, and the magnetic fields produced by the current elements on opposite sides of the sphere will have opposite directions.\n\nTherefore, the net magnetic field at the point located 10 cm away from the center of the sphere will be zero."
