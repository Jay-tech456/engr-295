    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. Although dark matter has not been directly observed, there is a significant amount of experimental evidence that supports its existence. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that the outer regions of galaxies rotate much faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter surrounding the galaxies, providing the additional gravitational force needed to hold the fast-moving stars in their orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: When light from a distant galaxy passes through a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, the gravitational field of the massive object bends the light, causing the distant galaxy to appear distorted. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, has been observed in many galaxy clusters, and the amount of distortion suggests the presence of much more mass than can be accounted for by the visible matter in the clusters. This additional mass is attributed to dark matter.\n\n3. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang. Detailed measurements of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB provide information about the density and composition of the early universe. These measurements indicate that a significant portion of the total mass-energy content of the universe is made up of non-baryonic, non-luminous matter, which is consistent with the concept of dark matter.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters, show that the presence of dark matter is necessary to explain the observed distribution of these structures. Dark matter acts as a gravitational \"glue\" that helps to hold these structures together.\n\nBeyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics in high-energy physics aims to explain phenomena that cannot be accounted for by the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter. Several BSM theories propose new particles and interactions that could account for dark matter. Some of the leading candidates for dark matter particles include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and have a mass in the range of 10 to 10,000 times the mass of a proton. They are a popular candidate for dark matter because they naturally arise in many BSM theories, such as supersymmetry.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics. They are much lighter than WIMPs and interact very weakly with ordinary matter, making them another potential candidate for dark matter.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical neutrinos that do not interact via the weak force, unlike the three known types of neutrinos in the Standard Model. They could be more massive than the known neutrinos and could potentially account for dark matter.\n\nExperimental searches for these dark matter candidates are ongoing, using a variety of techniques such as direct detection experiments, indirect detection through cosmic rays, and collider experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider. The discovery of dark matter particles would have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and would provide crucial insights into the nature of BSM physics."
