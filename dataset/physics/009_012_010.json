    "message_2": "To determine the position and magnification of the image formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nFor a concave lens, the focal length (f) is negative. In this case, the focal length is -20 cm, and the object distance (u) is -30 cm (negative because the object is on the same side as the image).\n\nPlugging these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/(-30)\n\nTo solve for v, first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-60 = 3v - 2v\n\n-60 = v\n\nSo, the image distance (v) is -60 cm, which means the image is formed 60 cm away from the lens on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values for v and u:\n\nM = -(-60)/(-30)\n\nM = 60/30\n\nM = 2\n\nThe magnification of the image formed by the concave lens is 2. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright and virtual.\n\nIn summary, the image is formed 60 cm away from the lens on the same side as the object, and the magnification of the image is 2, meaning it is twice the size of the object and upright."
