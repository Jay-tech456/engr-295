    "message_2": "Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that is believed to permeate all of space and is responsible for the observed acceleration in the expansion of the universe. In the context of General Relativity, dark energy can be described using the cosmological constant (denoted by Λ), which was first introduced by Albert Einstein as a modification to his field equations.\n\nThe Friedmann equations, derived from General Relativity, describe the expansion of the universe in terms of the scale factor (a), which is a function of time and represents the relative expansion of the universe. The presence of dark energy, through the cosmological constant, affects the expansion rate of the universe by providing a repulsive force that counteracts the attractive force of gravity.\n\nThe Friedmann equations can be written as:\n\n(1) H² = (8πG/3)ρ - k/a² + Λ/3\n(2) a¨/a = - (4πG/3)(ρ + 3p) + Λ/3\n\nHere, H is the Hubble parameter, G is the gravitational constant, ρ is the energy density of the universe, p is the pressure, k is the curvature constant, and a¨ is the second derivative of the scale factor with respect to time.\n\nThe first equation relates the expansion rate (H) to the energy density (ρ), curvature (k), and cosmological constant (Λ). The second equation describes the acceleration of the expansion (a¨/a) in terms of the energy density, pressure, and cosmological constant.\n\nIn a universe dominated by dark energy, the cosmological constant term (Λ/3) becomes the dominant factor in both equations. This leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe, as the repulsive force of dark energy overcomes the attractive force of gravity.\n\nObservations of distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation have provided strong evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe, which is consistent with the presence of dark energy. The current understanding is that dark energy makes up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe, while dark matter accounts for about 27%, and ordinary matter makes up the remaining 5%.\n\nIn summary, the presence of dark energy, as described by the cosmological constant in the context of General Relativity, contributes to the expansion rate of the universe by providing a repulsive force that counteracts gravity, leading to an accelerated expansion."
