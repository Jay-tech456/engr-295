    "message_2": "The minimum energy required to remove the outermost electron from a lithium atom in the ground state is called the ionization energy. For lithium, the first ionization energy is approximately 5.39 eV (electron volts) or 514 kJ/mol (kilojoules per mole). This is the energy needed to remove the outermost electron from a lithium atom and turn it into a Li+ ion."
