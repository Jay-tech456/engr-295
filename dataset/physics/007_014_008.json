    "message_2": "To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in Uranium-235, we need to know its atomic number and mass number. The atomic number of Uranium (U) is 92, which means it has 92 protons. Since the element is neutral, it also has 92 electrons.\n\nThe mass number of Uranium-235 is given as 235. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Therefore, we can calculate the number of neutrons as follows:\n\nNumber of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number\nNumber of neutrons = 235 - 92\nNumber of neutrons = 143\n\nSo, Uranium-235 has 92 protons, 143 neutrons, and 92 electrons.\n\nTo calculate the atomic mass of Uranium-235, we can use the mass number, which is approximately equal to the atomic mass for heavy elements like Uranium. The atomic mass of Uranium-235 is approximately 235 atomic mass units (amu)."
