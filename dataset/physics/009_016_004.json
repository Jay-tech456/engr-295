    "message_2": "To calculate the angular position of the first-order diffraction maximum, we can use the formula for single-slit diffraction:\n\nsin(θ) = (m * λ) / a\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the diffraction maximum, m is the order of the maximum (m = 1 for the first-order maximum), λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the same units. The wavelength λ is given in nanometers (nm), so we need to convert it to meters (m):\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500 * 10^(-9) m = 5 * 10^(-7) m\n\nThe width of the slit a is given in millimeters (mm), so we need to convert it to meters (m) as well:\n\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m = 1 * 10^(-4) m\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (1 * 5 * 10^(-7) m) / (1 * 10^(-4) m) = 5 * 10^(-3)\n\nTo find the angular position θ, we need to take the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nθ = arcsin(5 * 10^(-3))\n\nθ ≈ 0.2865 degrees\n\nThe angular position of the first-order diffraction maximum is approximately 0.2865 degrees.\n\nNow, to find the position on the screen 2 meters away, we can use the formula:\n\ny = L * tan(θ)\n\nwhere y is the position on the screen, L is the distance from the slit to the screen, and θ is the angular position of the diffraction maximum.\n\nL = 2 m\nθ ≈ 0.2865 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ_rad = θ * (π / 180) ≈ 0.2865 * (π / 180) ≈ 0.005 radians\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ny = 2 m * tan(0.005 radians) ≈ 2 m * 0.005 ≈ 0.01 m\n\nThe position of the first-order diffraction maximum on the screen is approximately 0.01 meters (or 1 cm) from the central maximum."
