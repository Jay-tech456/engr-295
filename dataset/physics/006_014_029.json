    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the first excited state in a helium atom, we can use the formula:\n\nLifetime (τ) = 1 / Transition probability (A)\n\nGiven the transition probability (A) = 6.15 × 10^-7 s^-1, we can calculate the lifetime (τ) as follows:\n\nτ = 1 / A\nτ = 1 / (6.15 × 10^-7 s^-1)\nτ ≈ 1.626 × 10^6 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the first excited state in a helium atom is approximately 1.626 × 10^6 seconds."
