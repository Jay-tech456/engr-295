    "message_1": "A coaxial cable carries a current of 5A. If the cable has an inner radius of 0.5 cm and outer radius of 1 cm, calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the axis of the cable. Assume that the current is distributed uniformly over the cross-section of the cable.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the axis of the cable, we'll use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFirst, let's find the current enclosed by a loop of radius 2 cm. Since the current is uniformly distributed over the cross-section of the cable, we can find the current density (J) as follows:\n\nJ = I / (π(R_outer² - R_inner²))\nJ = 5 A / (π(1² - 0.5²) cm²)\nJ = 5 A / (π(0.75) cm²)\nJ ≈ 7.089 A/cm²\n\nNow, let's consider a circular loop of radius r = 2 cm. The current enclosed by this loop is only the current in the region between the inner and outer radii of the cable. So, we need to find the area of this region:\n\nA_enclosed = π(r² - R_inner²)\nA_enclosed = π(2² - 0.5²) cm²\nA_enclosed = π(3.75) cm²\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current:\n\nI_enclosed = J * A_enclosed\nI_enclosed ≈ 7.089 A/cm² * π(3.75) cm²\nI_enclosed ≈ 5 A\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the axis of the cable. We'll consider a circular loop of radius r = 2 cm:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * 5 A\n\nB = (μ₀ * 5 A) / (2πr)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\nB ≈ (10^(-6) Tm/A * 5 A) / 0.04 m\nB ≈ 1.25 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the axis of the cable is approximately 1.25 × 10^(-4) T."
