    "message_2": "The current understanding of the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the universe is still incomplete, but significant progress has been made in recent years. Dark matter and dark energy are two distinct phenomena that have a profound impact on the expansion rate and structure formation of the universe.\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, as its gravitational pull helps to cluster galaxies together and form galaxy clusters.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious form of energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. It is believed to make up about 68% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. The exact nature of dark energy is still unknown, but it is often described as a cosmological constant or a form of vacuum energy that permeates all of space.\n\nThe impact of dark matter and dark energy on the expansion rate and structure formation of the universe can be observed through various cosmological observations:\n\n1. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Observations of the CMB, such as those made by the Planck satellite, have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. The CMB data show that the universe is composed of approximately 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy.\n\n2. Large Scale Structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe provides further evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. The observed patterns of galaxy clustering match the predictions made by models that include dark matter and dark energy, suggesting that these phenomena play a crucial role in the formation of cosmic structures.\n\n3. Supernovae Observations: The discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating came from observations of distant Type Ia supernovae. These supernovae serve as \"standard candles\" that allow astronomers to measure cosmic distances. The observed acceleration of the universe's expansion is consistent with the presence of dark energy.\n\n4. Gravitational Lensing: Dark matter can be indirectly observed through its gravitational effects on light from distant galaxies. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, causes the light from distant galaxies to be bent and distorted as it passes through the gravitational field of dark matter. Observations of gravitational lensing provide further evidence for the existence of dark matter and its role in the formation of cosmic structures.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact nature of dark matter and dark energy remains unknown, their impact on the expansion rate and structure formation of the universe is well-supported by various cosmological observations. These phenomena play a crucial role in shaping the universe as we know it, and ongoing research aims to uncover their true nature and properties."
