    "message_2": "The impact of collision energy on the production of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions is crucial, as it determines the conditions under which the QGP can be formed and the properties of the resulting plasma. A higher collision energy generally leads to a higher temperature and energy density, which are necessary for the formation of QGP. In this response, we will outline a theoretical model to predict the behavior of QGP formation at different collision energies.\n\n1. Initial conditions: The initial conditions of the heavy-ion collision, such as the size and shape of the colliding nuclei, the impact parameter, and the initial energy density, play a significant role in the formation of QGP. These factors can be modeled using a combination of classical and quantum mechanical approaches, such as the Glauber model and the Color Glass Condensate model.\n\n2. Evolution of the system: After the initial collision, the system evolves through various stages, including the formation of QGP, its expansion, and eventual cooling. The evolution of the system can be described using relativistic hydrodynamics, which takes into account the conservation of energy, momentum, and baryon number. The equation of state (EoS) of the system, which relates the pressure, energy density, and temperature, is a crucial input for the hydrodynamic model. The EoS can be obtained from lattice QCD calculations or phenomenological models.\n\n3. Transition to QGP: The transition from the initial state to the QGP phase depends on the collision energy and the critical temperature (Tc) for the deconfinement of quarks and gluons. The critical temperature can be estimated from lattice QCD calculations or from experimental data on the phase diagram of QCD matter. The formation of QGP can be modeled using statistical models, such as the Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES), which predicts the onset of deconfinement as a function of collision energy.\n\n4. Expansion and cooling: Once the QGP is formed, it undergoes a rapid expansion and cooling. The expansion can be described using relativistic hydrodynamics, while the cooling can be modeled using the EoS and the temperature-dependent transport coefficients, such as shear and bulk viscosities. The cooling of the system eventually leads to the hadronization of the QGP, which can be described using statistical hadronization models or coalescence models.\n\n5. Final state observables: The final state observables, such as particle yields, transverse momentum spectra, and flow coefficients, can be used to infer the properties of the QGP and the collision energy dependence of its formation. These observables can be calculated from the hydrodynamic model, taking into account the decoupling of the system and the subsequent hadronic interactions.\n\nIn summary, a theoretical model to predict the behavior of QGP formation at different collision energies can be developed by combining various approaches, such as initial condition models, relativistic hydrodynamics, lattice QCD calculations, and statistical models. The model can be used to study the properties of QGP and the phase diagram of QCD matter, as well as to guide the design of future heavy-ion collision experiments."
