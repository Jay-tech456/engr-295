    "message_2": "Holographic dualities, also known as AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories: a quantum field theory (QFT) and a string theory. The duality states that a QFT in d dimensions can be described by a string theory in (d+1) dimensions, where the extra dimension is curved, specifically an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. This correspondence allows us to study strongly coupled quantum field theories using the tools and techniques from string theory.\n\nTo calculate holographic dualities for a given system, follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify the quantum field theory (QFT) and its properties: Determine the QFT you want to study, its symmetries, and other relevant properties like the number of dimensions, coupling constants, and matter content.\n\n2. Find the corresponding string theory: Identify the appropriate string theory that is dual to the given QFT. This usually involves finding a string theory with the same symmetries and other properties that match the QFT. For example, the most well-known duality is between N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions and Type IIB string theory on AdS5 x S5.\n\n3. Construct the holographic dictionary: Establish a dictionary that relates the observables and quantities in the QFT to those in the string theory. This typically involves identifying the operators in the QFT that correspond to fields in the string theory and vice versa.\n\n4. Perform calculations in the string theory: Use the tools and techniques from string theory, such as perturbation theory, worldsheet techniques, or supergravity approximations, to perform calculations for the quantities of interest. This may involve computing correlation functions, partition functions, or other observables.\n\n5. Translate the results back to the QFT: Use the holographic dictionary to translate the results obtained in the string theory back to the corresponding quantities in the QFT. This allows you to gain insights into the strongly coupled regime of the QFT that may be difficult or impossible to access using traditional QFT techniques.\n\n6. Compare with other methods and experimental data: If possible, compare the results obtained from the holographic duality with those obtained from other methods, such as lattice QCD or perturbative QFT calculations, as well as experimental data. This can help validate the duality and provide further insights into the behavior of the QFT.\n\nIt is important to note that the AdS/CFT correspondence is still a conjecture, and many aspects of the duality are not yet fully understood. However, it has been extensively tested in various contexts and has provided valuable insights into the behavior of strongly coupled quantum field theories."
