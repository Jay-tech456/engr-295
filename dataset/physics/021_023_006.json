    "message_2": "Cosmic strings are hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects that may have formed during the early universe's phase transitions. They are predicted by some models of string theory and other high-energy physics theories. However, cosmic strings have not been directly observed, and their existence remains speculative.\n\nAs for black holes being a source of cosmic strings, there is no direct evidence or widely accepted theory that supports this idea. While some theoretical studies have explored the possibility of cosmic strings interacting with or being produced by black holes, these ideas are far from being established or confirmed by observational data.\n\nGiven the speculative nature of cosmic strings and the lack of direct evidence linking them to black holes, it is difficult to assign a precise probability to this scenario. However, based on current knowledge and understanding, the probability of black holes being a source of cosmic strings is considered low. Further research and observational data are needed to provide a more definitive answer to this question."
