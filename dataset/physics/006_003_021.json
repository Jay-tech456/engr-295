    "message_2": "To calculate the splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field using the Zeeman effect formula, we need to consider the energy difference between the magnetic sublevels. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:\n\nΔE = μ_B * B * m_j\n\nwhere μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m_j is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe Bohr magneton (μ_B) is given by:\n\nμ_B = e * hbar / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and m_e is the electron mass (9.11 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Bohr magneton:\n\nμ_B = (1.6 × 10^(-19) C) * (1.054 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg)\nμ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nFor the Hydrogen atom's n=3 to n=2 transition, we have the following possible values for m_j:\n\nm_j = -1, 0, 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy shifts for each m_j value with B = 0.5 T:\n\nΔE(-1) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * (-1) ≈ -4.637 × 10^(-24) J\nΔE(0) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * (0) ≈ 0 J\nΔE(1) = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (0.5 T) * (1) ≈ 4.637 × 10^(-24) J\n\nThe energy shifts correspond to the splitting of the spectral lines. To find the corresponding wavelengths, we can use the energy-wavelength relation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength.\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = h * c / ΔE\n\nNow, let's calculate the wavelengths for each energy shift:\n\nλ(-1) = (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) * (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (-4.637 × 10^(-24) J) ≈ -4.28 × 10^(-7) m\nλ(0) = No shift in wavelength\nλ(1) = (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) * (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (4.637 × 10^(-24) J) ≈ 4.28 × 10^(-7) m\n\nThe splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field of strength 0.5 T for the Hydrogen atom's n=3 to n=2 transition using the Zeeman effect formula is approximately -4.28 × 10^(-7) m, no shift, and 4.28 × 10^(-7) m."
