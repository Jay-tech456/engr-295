    "message_2": "The relationship between the intensity of cosmic rays and the activity cycle of the Sun is an inverse one. The activity cycle of the Sun, also known as the solar cycle, is an approximately 11-year cycle during which the Sun's magnetic activity fluctuates. This cycle is characterized by the increase and decrease in the number of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.\n\nDuring periods of high solar activity, such as solar maximum, the Sun's magnetic field is stronger and more complex. This enhanced magnetic field acts as a shield, deflecting and scattering incoming cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originating from outside our solar system. As a result, the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth is lower during solar maximum.\n\nOn the other hand, during periods of low solar activity, such as solar minimum, the Sun's magnetic field is weaker and less complex. This allows more cosmic rays to penetrate the solar system and reach Earth, leading to a higher intensity of cosmic rays.\n\nIn summary, the activity of the Sun does affect the intensity of cosmic rays hitting Earth. When the Sun is more active, its magnetic field provides better protection against cosmic rays, resulting in a lower intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth. Conversely, when the Sun is less active, its magnetic field is weaker, allowing more cosmic rays to reach Earth and resulting in a higher intensity of cosmic rays."
