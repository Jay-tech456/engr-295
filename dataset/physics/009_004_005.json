    "message_1": "A physics student is given a rectangular block of glass with a refractive index of 1.5. The block is immersed in air and a light beam is directed towards the side of the block at an angle of 30 degrees. The student is asked to calculate the critical angle at which the light beam will be totally reflected inside the block.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the critical angle at which the light beam will be totally reflected inside the glass block, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nHere, n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (glass), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (air), θ1 is the angle of incidence (critical angle), and θ2 is the angle of refraction (90 degrees, since the light beam is totally reflected).\n\nThe refractive index of air is approximately 1. We can now set up the equation to solve for the critical angle:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1 * sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for θ1 (the critical angle):\n\nsin(θ1) = 1 / 1.5\nθ1 = arcsin(1 / 1.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ1 ≈ 41.81°\n\nSo, the critical angle at which the light beam will be totally reflected inside the glass block is approximately 41.81 degrees."
