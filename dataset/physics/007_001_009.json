Given that the mass of a uranium-235 nucleus is 235.0439 atomic mass units and the speed of light is 2.998 × 10^8 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the nuclear fission of one uranium-235 nucleus, we can use Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the change in mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in mass during the fission process. The initial mass is the mass of the uranium-235 nucleus, which is 235.0439 atomic mass units (amu). The final masses are the masses of the two smaller nuclei, which are 95 amu and 140 amu. The total final mass is 95 + 140 = 235 amu.\n\nThe change in mass is the difference between the initial mass and the final mass: Δm = 235.0439 - 235 = 0.0439 amu.\n\nNext, we need to convert the change in mass from atomic mass units to kilograms. One atomic mass unit is equal to 1.66054 × 10^-27 kg, so:\n\nΔm = 0.0439 amu × (1.66054 × 10^-27 kg/amu) = 7.29 × 10^-29 kg.\n\nNow we can use Einstein's equation to find the energy released:\n\nE = mc^2 = (7.29 × 10^-29 kg) × (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2 = 6.54 × 10^-11 Joules.\n\nSo, the energy released in the nuclear fission of one uranium-235 nucleus into two smaller nuclei is approximately 6.54 × 10^-11 Joules."
