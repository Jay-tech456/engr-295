    "message_1": "\"A concave mirror has a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 15 cm in front of the mirror. Determine the magnification, image distance and the nature of the image formed by the mirror.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the mirror formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe mirror formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nThe magnification formula is given by:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nGiven, the focal length (f) is 20 cm and the object distance (do) is 15 cm. We can now find the image distance (di) using the mirror formula:\n\n1/20 = 1/15 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, first find the common denominator and subtract 1/15 from both sides:\n\n1/20 - 1/15 = 1/di\n\n(15 - 20) / (20 * 15) = 1/di\n\n-5 / 300 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = -300/5\n\ndi = -60 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is -60 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which means it is a virtual image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -di/do\n\nM = -(-60)/15\n\nM = 60/15\n\nM = 4\n\nThe magnification is 4, which means the image is 4 times larger than the object.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is a virtual image, located 60 cm in front of the mirror, and has a magnification of 4."
