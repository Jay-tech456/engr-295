    "message_2": "Electrical conductivity (σ) is the reciprocal of resistivity (ρ). The formula to calculate electrical conductivity is:\n\nσ = 1 / ρ\n\nGiven the resistivity of copper (ρ) is 1.68 × 10^-8 Ω·m, we can calculate the electrical conductivity as follows:\n\nσ = 1 / (1.68 × 10^-8 Ω·m)\n\nσ ≈ 5.95 × 10^7 S/m\n\nThe electrical conductivity of copper at room temperature is approximately 5.95 × 10^7 Siemens per meter (S/m)."
