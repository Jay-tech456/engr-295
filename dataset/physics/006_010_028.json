    "message_2": "The range of alpha particles in air depends on their initial energy. Typically, alpha particles have energies between 3 to 7 MeV (million electron volts). In air, the range of alpha particles is relatively short, usually around 2 to 10 centimeters.\n\nThe ability of alpha particles to penetrate materials is related to their range in air. Alpha particles are relatively heavy and have a +2 charge, which makes them more likely to interact with other atoms and molecules in their path. As a result, they lose energy quickly and have a limited range in air and other materials.\n\nThe Rutherford Scattering experiment, conducted by Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in 1909, demonstrated the nature of alpha particles and their interactions with matter. In the experiment, a beam of alpha particles was directed at a thin gold foil. Most of the alpha particles passed through the foil with little or no deflection, but a small fraction of them were scattered at large angles, some even bouncing back toward the source.\n\nThis observation led Rutherford to propose the existence of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The large-angle scattering of alpha particles occurred when they came close to the gold nuclei, and the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged alpha particles and the gold nuclei caused the deflection.\n\nThe Rutherford Scattering experiment also demonstrated the limited penetration ability of alpha particles. The fact that most alpha particles passed through the gold foil with little or no deflection indicated that they did not interact with the majority of the atoms in the foil. However, the small fraction of alpha particles that did interact with the gold nuclei experienced significant deflection, illustrating the short range and limited penetration ability of alpha particles in materials.\n\nIn summary, the range of alpha particles in air is relatively short (2 to 10 cm) due to their heavy mass and +2 charge, which leads to frequent interactions with other atoms and molecules. The Rutherford Scattering experiment demonstrated the limited penetration ability of alpha particles, as well as the existence of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom."
