    "message_2": "To find the half-life of technetium-99m, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the remaining amount of the substance at time t, N0 is the initial amount of the substance, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nN(t) = 1.25 grams\nN0 = 10 grams\nt = 3 hours\n\nWe need to find T (the half-life). Rearranging the formula to solve for T, we get:\n\nT = t * (log(1/2) / log(N(t)/N0))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT = 3 * (log(1/2) / log(1.25/10))\nT ≈ 3 * (log(1/2) / log(1/8))\nT ≈ 3 * (log(1/2) / (-3 * log(2)))\nT ≈ 3 / 3\nT = 1 hour\n\nSo, the half-life of technetium-99m is approximately 1 hour."
