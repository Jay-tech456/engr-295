    "message_2": "To find the distance between the two lenses, we first need to determine the image distance for each lens. We can use the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nFor the first lens, we have:\n\n1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v1\n\nSolving for v1, we get:\n\nv1 = 60 cm\n\nNow, let's consider the chromatic aberration. The image distance for the second lens (v2) will be 2 cm shorter than the first lens due to the chromatic aberration:\n\nv2 = v1 - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58 cm\n\nNow, we can use the lens formula again for the second lens:\n\n1/f2 = 1/30 + 1/58\n\nSolving for f2, we get:\n\nf2 ≈ 19.33 cm\n\nSince the two lenses are combined to form a single lens with a focal length of 20 cm, we can use the formula for the combined focal length of two thin lenses:\n\n1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1*f2)\n\nwhere d is the distance between the two lenses.\n\nWe know f = 20 cm, f1 = 20 cm, and f2 ≈ 19.33 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n1/20 = 1/20 + 1/19.33 - d/(20*19.33)\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd ≈ 0.97 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the two lenses is approximately 0.97 cm."
