The lattice constant of silicon is 5.43 Å and the linear thermal expansion coefficient is 2.6 × 10^-6 K^-1.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon crystal along the [100] direction, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:\n\nΔL = L0 * α * ΔT\n\nwhere ΔL is the change in length, L0 is the initial length, α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in length (ΔL) and the change in temperature (ΔT).\n\nGiven:\nInitial length (L0) = 2 cm\nFinal length (Lf) = 2.08 cm\nLinear thermal expansion coefficient (α) = 2.6 × 10^-6 K^-1\nLattice constant of silicon = 5.43 Å\n\nΔL = Lf - L0 = 2.08 cm - 2 cm = 0.08 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the change in temperature (ΔT). Since we are given the temperature at which the final length is measured (300 K), we can assume that the initial temperature is at 0 K (absolute zero). Therefore, ΔT = 300 K - 0 K = 300 K.\n\nNow we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion to find the thermal expansion coefficient (α) along the [100] direction:\n\nΔL = L0 * α * ΔT\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for α:\n\nα = ΔL / (L0 * ΔT)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nα = 0.08 cm / (2 cm * 300 K) = 0.08 / 600 = 1.33 × 10^-4 K^-1\n\nSo, the thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon crystal along the [100] direction is approximately 1.33 × 10^-4 K^-1."
