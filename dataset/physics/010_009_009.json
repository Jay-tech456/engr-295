A hole with a radius of 0.1 meters is located at a height of 5 meters from the base of the container. Assuming no air resistance, calculate the velocity of the water as it leaves the hole.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the velocity of the water as it leaves the hole, we can use Torricelli's Law, which is derived from Bernoulli's equation for fluid flow. Torricelli's Law states that the speed of efflux of a fluid under the force of gravity is given by:\n\nv = √(2gh)\n\nwhere:\nv = velocity of the water as it leaves the hole\ng = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)\nh = height of the water above the hole\n\nIn this case, the hole is located at a height of 5 meters from the base of the container, so h = 5 meters. Now we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nv = √(2 × 9.81 m/s² × 5 m)\nv = √(98.1 m²/s²)\nv ≈ 9.9 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the water as it leaves the hole is approximately 9.9 meters per second."
