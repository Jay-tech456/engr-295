    "message_2": "The Higgs boson is an unstable particle that decays into other particles almost immediately after being produced. Its lifetime is extremely short, around 1.56 x 10^(-22) seconds. The lifetime of the Higgs boson does not depend on the decay mode, as it is an intrinsic property of the particle itself.\n\nHowever, the branching ratios for different decay modes can vary. The branching ratio is the probability of a particular decay mode occurring relative to all possible decay modes. For the Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV, the branching ratios for the ZZ and WW decay modes are approximately:\n\n- ZZ decay mode: ~ 2.7%\n- WW decay mode: ~ 21.5%\n\nThis means that the Higgs boson is more likely to decay into a pair of W bosons (W+ and W-) than into a pair of Z bosons. However, it is important to note that the lifetime of the Higgs boson remains the same regardless of the decay mode. The branching ratios only describe the probability of each decay mode occurring."
