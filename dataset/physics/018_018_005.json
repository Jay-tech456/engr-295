    "message_2": "A non-zero impact parameter in heavy-ion collisions has a significant effect on the elliptic flow of particles produced at a given energy. The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance between the centers of the colliding ions when they are far apart. It is a measure of the degree of overlap between the two colliding nuclei.\n\nWhen the impact parameter is non-zero, the overlap region between the two colliding nuclei is not symmetric, resulting in an almond-shaped interaction region. This spatial anisotropy in the initial state of the collision leads to the development of anisotropic pressure gradients, which in turn cause anisotropic particle emission patterns. This anisotropic particle emission is referred to as elliptic flow.\n\nElliptic flow is characterized by the second harmonic coefficient (v2) in the Fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles. A larger non-zero impact parameter typically results in a stronger elliptic flow signal, as the spatial anisotropy in the initial state is more pronounced.\n\nThe elliptic flow is sensitive to the properties of the produced matter, such as its viscosity and the equation of state. Therefore, studying the elliptic flow of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions with non-zero impact parameters provides valuable information about the properties of the strongly interacting matter created in these collisions, such as the quark-gluon plasma."
