    "message_2": "To determine the image distance, we can use the mirror equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nwhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nGiven the focal length (f) is -10 cm and the object distance (do) is 40 cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n1/(-10) = 1/40 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n-4/40 = 1/40 + 1/di\n\nNow, subtract 1/40 from both sides:\n\n-5/40 = 1/di\n\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\ndi = -40/5\n\ndi = -8 cm\n\nThe image distance (di) is -8 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is formed on the same side as the object, which is a virtual image.\n\nNow, to find the magnification (m), we can use the magnification equation:\n\nm = -di/do\n\nPlugging in the values for di and do:\n\nm = -(-8)/40\n\nm = 8/40\n\nm = 1/5\n\nThe magnification is 1/5 or 0.2, which means the image is 1/5th the size of the object and is upright since the magnification is positive."
