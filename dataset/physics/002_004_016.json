    "message_2": "To determine the enthalpy change for the reaction, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔH = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)\n\nFirst, we need to balance the chemical equation for the reaction:\n\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of methane (CH4) in 5.5 grams:\n\nMoles of CH4 = mass / molar mass\nMoles of CH4 = 5.5 g / (12.01 g/mol C + 4 * 1.01 g/mol H) = 5.5 g / 16.04 g/mol ≈ 0.343 mol\n\nSince the reaction is balanced, we know that 1 mole of CH4 reacts with 2 moles of O2 to produce 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O. Therefore, the moles of products formed are:\n\nMoles of CO2 = 0.343 mol\nMoles of H2O = 2 * 0.343 mol = 0.686 mol\n\nNow, we can use the enthalpy change equation:\n\nΔH = [0.343 mol * (-393.5 kJ/mol CO2) + 0.686 mol * (-241.8 kJ/mol H2O)] - [0.343 mol * (-74.8 kJ/mol CH4)]\n\nΔH = [-135.0 kJ (CO2) - 165.9 kJ (H2O)] - [-25.7 kJ (CH4)]\n\nΔH = -300.9 kJ + 25.7 kJ = -275.2 kJ\n\nThe enthalpy change for the reaction is approximately -275.2 kJ."
