    "message_2": "To find the upthrust force acting on the block, we need to first find the volume of the block and then use the Archimedes' principle.\n\n1. Find the volume of the block:\nVolume = length × width × height\nConvert the dimensions from cm to meters:\nLength = 8 cm = 0.08 m\nWidth = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nHeight = 15 cm = 0.15 m\n\nVolume = 0.08 m × 0.1 m × 0.15 m = 0.0012 m³\n\n2. Calculate the weight of the water displaced by the block using Archimedes' principle:\nWeight of water displaced = Volume of block × Density of water × Acceleration due to gravity\nWeight of water displaced = 0.0012 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.8 m/s² = 11.76 N\n\nThe upthrust force acting on the block is equal to the weight of the water displaced, which is 11.76 N."
