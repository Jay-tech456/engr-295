    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to account for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. Several particle candidates have been proposed to explain the nature of dark matter. Some of the most promising candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are among the most popular dark matter candidates. They are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through gravity and the weak nuclear force, but not through the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces. This makes them difficult to detect directly. WIMPs are expected to have a mass in the range of 10 to 10,000 times the mass of a proton, and their weak interactions make them suitable candidates for dark matter as they would not emit, absorb, or reflect light.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are very light, with a mass much smaller than that of an electron, and interact very weakly with ordinary matter. Axions are expected to be produced in large quantities in the early universe and could account for the observed dark matter abundance. Their extremely weak interactions with other particles make them a suitable dark matter candidate.\n\n3. Sterile Neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via any of the known fundamental forces except gravity. They are heavier than the known active neutrinos and could be produced in the early universe through various mechanisms. Their weak gravitational interactions and lack of electromagnetic interactions make them suitable dark matter candidates.\n\n4. Primordial Black Holes: Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the early universe due to density fluctuations. They could have a wide range of masses, from much smaller than the mass of the Sun to several solar masses. Although they are not particles, primordial black holes are considered dark matter candidates because they do not emit, absorb, or reflect light and interact with other matter primarily through gravity.\n\nThese candidates possess properties that make them suitable explanations for the observed behavior of dark matter in the universe, such as their weak or nonexistent interactions with electromagnetic radiation and their ability to account for the observed abundance of dark matter. However, despite extensive experimental searches, none of these candidates have been conclusively detected, and the true nature of dark matter remains one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in modern physics."
