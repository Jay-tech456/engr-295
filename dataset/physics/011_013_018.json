    "message_2": "The Drude model is a classical model used to describe the electrical conductivity of metals. According to this model, the electrical conductivity (σ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσ = n * e^2 * τ / m\n\nwhere:\n- n is the electron density (8.5 x 10^22 m^-3)\n- e is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C)\n- τ is the average time between collisions (3.0 x 10^-14 s)\n- m is the effective mass of the conduction electrons, which can be approximated as the mass of a free electron (9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the electrical conductivity:\n\nσ = (8.5 x 10^22 m^-3) * (1.6 x 10^-19 C)^2 * (3.0 x 10^-14 s) / (9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\nσ ≈ 5.98 x 10^7 S/m\n\nSo, the electrical conductivity of copper at room temperature (298 K) is approximately 5.98 x 10^7 S/m (Siemens per meter)."
