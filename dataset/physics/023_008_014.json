    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) share an entangled state, which in this case is the Bell state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$. Let's denote the unknown quantum state to be teleported as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex coefficients such that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$.\n\nThe total state of the three qubits (the unknown state and the two entangled qubits) is given by:\n\n$|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle) \\otimes (|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$.\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell measurement on the unknown state and her qubit. The Bell measurement projects the state onto one of the four Bell states:\n\n1. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$\n2. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle - |11\\rangle)$\n3. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$\n4. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle - |10\\rangle)$\n\nDepending on the outcome of the Bell measurement, the state of Bob's qubit will be transformed into one of the following states:\n\n1. $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$\n2. $Z|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle - \\beta|1\\rangle$\n3. $X|\\psi\\rangle = \\beta|0\\rangle + \\alpha|1\\rangle$\n4. $ZX|\\psi\\rangle = \\beta|0\\rangle - \\alpha|1\\rangle$\n\nAlice then communicates the result of her Bell measurement to Bob using classical communication. Based on this information, Bob can apply the appropriate unitary transformation (identity, $Z$, $X$, or $ZX$) to recover the original unknown state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nSince the Bell measurement projects the state onto one of the four Bell states with equal probability, the probability of successfully teleporting the unknown quantum state using the quantum teleportation protocol is 100%. This is because, regardless of the outcome of the Bell measurement, Bob can always recover the original state by applying the appropriate unitary transformation."
