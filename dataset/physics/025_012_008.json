    "message_2": "To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the binding of protein X and ligand Y, we can use the following equation:\n\nΔG = -RT ln(K)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K), and K is the equilibrium constant (Kd) for the interaction.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Kd value from nM to M:\n\n10 nM = 10 × 10^(-9) M = 1 × 10^(-8) M\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\nΔG = -(8.314 J/mol·K) × (298.15 K) × ln(1 × 10^(-8) M)\n\nΔG ≈ - (8.314 J/mol·K) × (298.15 K) × (-18.42)\n\nΔG ≈ 45.7 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the binding of protein X and ligand Y at a temperature of 25°C and a pH of 7.4 is approximately 45.7 kJ/mol."
