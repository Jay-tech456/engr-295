    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a0) is the most probable distance between the proton and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na0 = (4πε0ħ²) / (me²)\n\nwhere:\nε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²)\nħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 J·s)\ne is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\nme is the mass of the electron\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the electron from atomic mass units (u) to kilograms (kg). The conversion factor is 1 u = 1.66054 x 10^-27 kg.\n\nme = 0.0005486 u * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg/u) = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\na0 = (4π * 8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m² * (1.054 x 10^-34 J·s)²) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)²)\na0 ≈ 5.291 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius in a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291 x 10^-11 meters."
