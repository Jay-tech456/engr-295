    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as the ratio of the cooling effect (Q_c) to the work input (W). In this case, the cooling rate is given as 500 J/s, and the power consumed by the refrigerator is 2000 W (which is equivalent to 2000 J/s). \n\nCOP = Q_c / W\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nCOP = (500 J/s) / (2000 J/s)\n\nCOP = 0.25\n\nThe coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is 0.25."
