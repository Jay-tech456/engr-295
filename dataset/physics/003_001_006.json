    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 10 cm away from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire to the current through the wire. The formula for the magnetic field (B) at a distance (r) from a long, straight wire carrying a current (I) is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space, which is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nGiven the current I = 2 A and the distance r = 10 cm = 0.1 m, we can now calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nThe Ampere (A) units cancel out:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (2 * π * 0.1 m)\n\nNow we can simplify the expression:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (0.2π m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m * 2) / (0.2 m)\n\nNow we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB ≈ (8 × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.2 m)\n\nB ≈ 4 × 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field 10 cm away from the wire is approximately 4 × 10^(-6) Tesla."
