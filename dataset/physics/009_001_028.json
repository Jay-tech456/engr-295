    "message_2": "To find the thickness of the glass sheet, we can use the formula for apparent depth:\n\nApparent depth = Real depth / Refractive index\n\nWe are given the apparent depth (0.35 cm) and the refractive index (n = 1.5) of the glass. We can rearrange the formula to find the real depth (which is the thickness of the glass sheet):\n\nReal depth = Apparent depth * Refractive index\n\nReal depth = 0.35 cm * 1.5\n\nReal depth = 0.525 cm\n\nSo, the thickness of the glass sheet is 0.525 cm."
