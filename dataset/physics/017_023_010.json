    "message_2": "The effect of an applied magnetic field on magnetic domain wall propagation and stability in a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material can be understood by considering the competition between the energy terms involved in the system. These energy terms include the exchange energy, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, the magnetoelastic energy, and the Zeeman energy.\n\nWhen an external magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material, the magnetic moments within the material tend to align with the direction of the applied field. This alignment reduces the overall magnetic energy of the system, which is known as the Zeeman energy. As the applied magnetic field strength increases, the Zeeman energy becomes more dominant, and the magnetic moments within the material become more aligned with the field direction.\n\nThis alignment of magnetic moments affects the magnetic domain walls in the material. Domain walls are the boundaries between regions of uniform magnetization, called domains, in a magnetic material. The propagation and stability of these domain walls are influenced by the balance of the various energy terms mentioned earlier.\n\nAs the applied magnetic field strength increases, the Zeeman energy becomes more dominant, and the domain walls tend to move in the direction of the applied field. This movement of domain walls is known as domain wall propagation. The applied magnetic field can also affect the stability of the domain walls. A stronger magnetic field can cause the domain walls to become more stable, as the energy barrier for domain wall motion increases.\n\nHowever, if the applied magnetic field strength becomes too strong, it can overcome the energy barrier and cause the domain walls to collapse, leading to a single-domain state in the material. This single-domain state is characterized by a uniform magnetization direction throughout the material, which is aligned with the applied magnetic field.\n\nIn summary, the applied magnetic field strength affects the magnetic domain wall propagation and stability in a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material by influencing the balance of the various energy terms in the system. As the magnetic field strength increases, the domain walls tend to move in the direction of the applied field and can become more stable. However, if the applied field strength is too strong, it can cause the domain walls to collapse, leading to a single-domain state in the material."
