    "message_2": "To calculate the rate of heat transfer through the copper rod, we can use the formula for heat conduction:\n\nQ/t = k * A * (T1 - T2) / L\n\nwhere Q/t is the rate of heat transfer, k is the thermal conductivity of the material, A is the cross-sectional area, T1 and T2 are the temperatures at the two ends of the rod, and L is the length of the rod.\n\nGiven values:\nk (thermal conductivity of copper) = 400 W/mK\nA (cross-sectional area) = 2 cm² = 2 * 10^(-4) m² (converting to square meters)\nT1 (temperature at the heated end) = 200°C\nT2 (temperature at the other end) = 0°C\nL (length of the rod) = 50 cm = 0.5 m (converting to meters)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ/t = (400 W/mK) * (2 * 10^(-4) m²) * (200°C - 0°C) / 0.5 m\n\nQ/t = (400 W/mK) * (2 * 10^(-4) m²) * (200 K) / 0.5 m\n\nQ/t = 80000 W/m²\n\nThe rate of heat transfer through the copper rod is 80,000 W/m²."
