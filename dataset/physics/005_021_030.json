    "message_1": "A photon is emitted at t=0 from the point x=0 in the direction of x-axis with a frequency of 6.25 x 10^14 Hz. At t=1 nanosecond, the photon reaches a stationary mirror placed at x=3 meters. The mirror starts moving perpendicularly to the x-axis towards the photon at a speed of 0.6c (where c is the speed of light in vacuum). Calculate the following:\n\n1. The frequency and wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the stationary observer.\n2. The frequency and wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the moving mirror.\n3. The time taken for the reflected photon to reach the origin (x=0) again as observed by the stationary observer.",
    "message_2": "1. The frequency and wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the stationary observer:\n\nSince the mirror is moving perpendicularly to the x-axis, there is no Doppler effect in the x-direction. Therefore, the frequency of the reflected photon remains the same as the initial frequency, which is 6.25 x 10^14 Hz.\n\nTo find the wavelength, we can use the formula: speed of light (c) = frequency (f) * wavelength (λ)\n\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\nf = 6.25 x 10^14 Hz\n\nλ = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.25 x 10^14 Hz) ≈ 4.8 x 10^-7 m\n\nSo, the wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the stationary observer is approximately 4.8 x 10^-7 m.\n\n2. The frequency and wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the moving mirror:\n\nSince the mirror is moving perpendicularly to the x-axis, there is no Doppler effect in the x-direction. Therefore, the frequency and wavelength of the reflected photon as observed by the moving mirror are the same as those observed by the stationary observer.\n\nFrequency: 6.25 x 10^14 Hz\nWavelength: 4.8 x 10^-7 m\n\n3. The time taken for the reflected photon to reach the origin (x=0) again as observed by the stationary observer:\n\nSince the mirror is moving perpendicularly to the x-axis, the distance between the mirror and the origin remains the same (3 meters). The photon has to travel this distance again to reach the origin.\n\nWe can use the formula: time (t) = distance (d) / speed (v)\n\nt = d / v = 3 m / (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 1 x 10^-8 s\n\nSo, the time taken for the reflected photon to reach the origin again as observed by the stationary observer is 10 nanoseconds."
