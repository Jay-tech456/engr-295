    "message_2": "Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation and charged particles emitted from the Sun. These events can have a significant impact on the intensity and energy spectrum of cosmic rays observed on Earth. The effects of solar flares on cosmic rays can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Forbush Decrease: When a solar flare occurs, it releases a large number of charged particles and magnetic fields into space. These particles, known as solar energetic particles (SEPs), can interact with cosmic rays and cause a temporary decrease in their intensity. This phenomenon is known as a Forbush Decrease. The decrease in cosmic ray intensity can last from a few hours to several days, depending on the strength of the solar flare and the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n\n2. Modulation of Galactic Cosmic Rays: Solar flares can also affect the energy spectrum of cosmic rays. The increased magnetic activity associated with solar flares can cause the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) to be modulated. This means that the number of high-energy cosmic rays reaching Earth can be reduced during periods of high solar activity. Conversely, during periods of low solar activity, the energy spectrum of GCRs can be less affected, allowing more high-energy cosmic rays to reach Earth.\n\n3. Solar Energetic Particles: In addition to modulating the energy spectrum of GCRs, solar flares can also produce their own high-energy particles, known as solar energetic particles (SEPs). These particles can have energies ranging from a few MeV to several GeV, and they can contribute to the overall cosmic ray intensity observed on Earth. However, SEPs are typically much less energetic than GCRs, and their contribution to the total cosmic ray intensity is relatively small.\n\nIn summary, solar flares can have a significant impact on the intensity and energy spectrum of cosmic rays observed on Earth. They can cause temporary decreases in cosmic ray intensity (Forbush Decreases), modulate the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays, and produce solar energetic particles that contribute to the overall cosmic ray intensity."
