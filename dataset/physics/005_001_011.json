    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling at 0.5c relative to the Earth. An astronaut on the spaceship measures their own time interval between two events as 2.0 hours. What is the time interval between those same two events as measured by an observer on Earth? Use the formula for time dilation in a moving frame of reference to determine the answer.",
    "message_2": "To find the time interval between the two events as measured by an observer on Earth, we can use the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nwhere:\nΔt is the time interval measured by the observer on Earth,\nΔt₀ is the time interval measured by the astronaut on the spaceship (2.0 hours),\nv is the relative velocity of the spaceship (0.5c),\nc is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the value of (1 - v²/c²):\n\n1 - (0.5c)²/c² = 1 - 0.25c²/c² = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nNow, we can find the square root of 0.75:\n\n√0.75 ≈ 0.866\n\nFinally, we can calculate the time interval Δt:\n\nΔt = Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²) = 2.0 hours / 0.866 ≈ 2.31 hours\n\nSo, the time interval between the two events as measured by an observer on Earth is approximately 2.31 hours."
