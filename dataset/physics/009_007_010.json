    "message_1": "A physics student wants to design a convex lens with a focal length of 20 cm. What should be the radius of curvature of each of the lens surfaces if the refractive index of the lens material is 1.5?",
    "message_2": "To find the radius of curvature of each of the lens surfaces, we can use the lensmaker's equation:\n\n1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)\n\nwhere f is the focal length, n is the refractive index of the lens material, R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface, and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.\n\nFor a biconvex lens, both surfaces have the same radius of curvature, so R1 = R2 = R. The lensmaker's equation becomes:\n\n1/f = 2 * (n - 1) / R\n\nNow we can plug in the given values for f and n:\n\n1/20 cm = 2 * (1.5 - 1) / R\n\n1/20 cm = 1 / R\n\nR = 20 cm\n\nSo, the radius of curvature of each of the lens surfaces should be 20 cm."
