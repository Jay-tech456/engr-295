    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of refraction inside the glass medium, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nwhere n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and angle of incidence in the first medium (air), and n2 and θ2 are the refractive index and angle of refraction in the second medium (glass).\n\nIn this case, n1 = 1 (refractive index of air), θ1 = 45 degrees, and n2 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass). We want to find θ2, the angle of refraction inside the glass medium.\n\n1 * sin(45) = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nsin(45) = 0.7071 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\n0.7071 = 1.5 * sin(θ2)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n0.7071 / 1.5 = sin(θ2)\n\n0.4714 ≈ sin(θ2)\n\nTo find θ2, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.4714:\n\nθ2 = arcsin(0.4714)\n\nθ2 ≈ 28.1 degrees (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nSo, the angle of refraction of the light ray inside the glass medium is approximately 28.1 degrees."
