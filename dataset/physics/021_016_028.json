    "message_2": "Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) play a significant role in the distribution of galaxies within the cosmic web and the overall theory of cosmic evolution. The cosmic web is a large-scale structure of the universe, consisting of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and dark matter, interconnected by filaments of baryonic matter and dark matter.\n\nThe impact of supermassive black holes on the distribution of galaxies can be summarized in the following ways:\n\n1. Galaxy formation and evolution: SMBHs are believed to reside at the centers of most, if not all, massive galaxies. The presence of a SMBH can influence the formation and evolution of its host galaxy through various processes, such as accretion of surrounding matter and the release of energy in the form of radiation and powerful jets. This energy can heat up and disperse the surrounding gas, preventing it from cooling and forming new stars, thereby regulating the growth of the galaxy.\n\n2. Gravitational interactions: SMBHs can also impact the distribution of galaxies through gravitational interactions. When two galaxies merge, their central SMBHs can form a binary system, which eventually coalesces into a single, more massive black hole. This process can release gravitational waves and cause the newly formed black hole to be ejected from the galaxy center, altering the distribution of galaxies within the cosmic web.\n\n3. AGN feedback: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by SMBHs accreting matter from their surroundings. The energy released by AGN can have a significant impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the cosmic web. This feedback can heat and ionize the IGM, affecting the formation and distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThese impacts of SMBHs on the distribution of galaxies within the cosmic web support the theory of cosmic evolution in several ways:\n\n1. Regulation of galaxy growth: The presence of SMBHs and their influence on star formation help explain the observed relationship between the mass of a galaxy's central black hole and the properties of its host galaxy, such as its stellar mass and velocity dispersion.\n\n2. Large-scale structure formation: The feedback from SMBHs, particularly AGN feedback, can influence the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters and the cosmic web itself. This feedback can suppress the formation of small galaxies and enhance the growth of massive galaxies, leading to the observed distribution of galaxies within the cosmic web.\n\n3. Cosmic history: The growth and evolution of SMBHs, as well as their impact on the distribution of galaxies, provide important insights into the history of the universe. By studying the properties and distribution of SMBHs and their host galaxies, we can learn more about the processes that shaped the cosmic web and the universe as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, supermassive black holes play a crucial role in shaping the distribution of galaxies within the cosmic web and contribute significantly to our understanding of cosmic evolution."
