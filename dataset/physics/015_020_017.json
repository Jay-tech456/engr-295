    "message_1": "What is the predicted frequency range for gravitational waves emitted by a population of binary white dwarfs with a total mass of 1.5 solar masses, in which both white dwarfs have a mass of 0.75 solar masses and are separated by a distance of 0.1 astronomical units? Given that the sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detector is optimized for frequencies between 10 and 1000 Hz, discuss the detectability of these gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency range of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system of white dwarfs, we can use the following formula for the orbital frequency (f_orbital) of a binary system:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt(G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two white dwarfs, and a is the separation between them.\n\nGiven that both white dwarfs have a mass of 0.75 solar masses, and they are separated by a distance of 0.1 astronomical units (AU), we can convert these values to SI units:\n\nM1 = M2 = 0.75 * M_sun = 0.75 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.49175 x 10^30 kg\na = 0.1 AU = 0.1 * 1.496 x 10^11 m = 1.496 x 10^10 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the orbital frequency:\n\nf_orbital = (1 / (2 * pi)) * sqrt((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (2 * 1.49175 x 10^30 kg) / (1.496 x 10^10 m)^3)\nf_orbital ≈ 0.0044 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary system is twice the orbital frequency:\n\nf_gravitational = 2 * f_orbital ≈ 0.0088 Hz\n\nThis frequency is much lower than the sensitivity range of the Advanced LIGO detector, which is optimized for frequencies between 10 and 1000 Hz. Therefore, the gravitational waves emitted by this population of binary white dwarfs would not be detectable by Advanced LIGO."
