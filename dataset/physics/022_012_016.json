    "message_2": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up about 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. The presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies in the universe. \n\nCurrent theories and observations suggest that dark matter affects the formation of large-scale structures in the following ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to hold galaxies and galaxy clusters together. Observations of the motion of stars and galaxies indicate that they are moving at speeds that should cause them to fly apart if only the visible matter were present. The presence of dark matter provides the extra gravitational pull required to keep these structures intact.\n\n2. Cosmic web: Dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic web, a large-scale structure of the universe consisting of interconnected filaments of dark matter and gas. This cosmic web acts as a scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The gravitational force of dark matter attracts baryonic matter (ordinary matter made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons) into these filaments, leading to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters along the cosmic web.\n\n3. Growth of structures: Dark matter plays a crucial role in the growth of structures in the universe. According to the current understanding of structure formation, small fluctuations in the density of matter in the early universe led to the formation of dark matter halos. These halos attracted baryonic matter, which eventually formed stars and galaxies. Over time, these structures merged and grew due to the gravitational pull of dark matter, leading to the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\n4. Cold dark matter model: The current leading model for the formation of large-scale structures in the universe is the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. In this model, dark matter particles are assumed to be slow-moving (cold) and collisionless. The CDM model successfully explains many observed features of the large-scale structure of the universe, such as the distribution of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the abundance of galaxy clusters.\n\n5. Observational evidence: Several lines of observational evidence support the role of dark matter in the formation of large-scale structures. For example, the observed distribution of galaxies in the universe is consistent with the predictions of the CDM model. Additionally, gravitational lensing, a phenomenon where the path of light is bent due to the gravitational influence of massive objects, has provided indirect evidence for the presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies in the universe. Its gravitational effects provide the necessary force to hold these structures together and drive their growth over time. Current theories, such as the Cold Dark Matter model, and observational evidence, such as gravitational lensing, support the importance of dark matter in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe."
