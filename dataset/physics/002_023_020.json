    "message_2": "To calculate the vapor pressure of water at 25 degrees Celsius, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/P1) = -ΔHvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively, ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe are given the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 40.7 kJ/mol, which we need to convert to J/mol:\n\nΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol * (1000 J/1 kJ) = 40700 J/mol\n\nWe are also given the standard atmospheric pressure (P1) as 1 atm, which we need to convert to Pa:\n\nP1 = 1 atm * (101325 Pa/1 atm) = 101325 Pa\n\nThe temperatures T1 and T2 are given in Celsius, which we need to convert to Kelvin:\n\nT1 = 100 °C + 273.15 = 373.15 K (boiling point of water)\nT2 = 25 °C + 273.15 = 298.15 K\n\nThe ideal gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/(mol*K).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\nln(P2/101325) = -40700 J/mol / 8.314 J/(mol*K) * (1/298.15 K - 1/373.15 K)\n\nSolving for P2:\n\nP2 = 101325 * exp[-40700 / 8.314 * (1/298.15 - 1/373.15)]\nP2 ≈ 3169.6 Pa\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of water at 25 degrees Celsius is approximately 3169.6 Pa."
