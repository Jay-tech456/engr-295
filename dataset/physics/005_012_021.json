    "message_2": "To calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the proton, we will use the following formula:\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the proton (0.9c) and c is the speed of light.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.9c)^2/c^2)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.81)\nγ = 1 / sqrt(0.19)\nγ ≈ 2.294\n\nNow, let's find the relativistic kinetic energy (K):\n\nThe mass of a proton (m) is approximately 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nK = (γ - 1)mc^2\nK = (2.294 - 1)(1.67 × 10^(-27) kg)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nK ≈ 1.294 × 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg × 9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2\nK ≈ 2.161 × 10^(-10) J\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy of the proton is approximately 2.161 × 10^(-10) joules."
