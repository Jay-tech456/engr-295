    "message_2": "To calculate the energy released in the form of gravitational waves by a binary neutron star system, we can use the following formula:\n\nE = (G^2 * M1^2 * M2^2 * (M1 + M2)) / (5 * c^5 * R)\n\nwhere E is the energy released, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the two neutron stars, c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and R is the distance between the two neutron stars.\n\nFirst, we need to find the individual masses of the two neutron stars. Since we know the combined mass is 2.9 solar masses, we can assume that the masses are roughly equal, so M1 = M2 = 1.45 solar masses. To convert solar masses to kilograms, we can use the following conversion factor: 1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg. Therefore, M1 = M2 = 1.45 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 2.884 x 10^30 kg.\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance between the two neutron stars from kilometers to meters: 600 km = 600,000 m.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nE = (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)^2 * (2.884 x 10^30 kg)^2 * (2.884 x 10^30 kg) / (5 * (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)^5 * 600,000 m)\n\nE â‰ˆ 1.34 x 10^46 J\n\nSo, the energy released in the form of gravitational waves by the binary neutron star system is approximately 1.34 x 10^46 Joules."
