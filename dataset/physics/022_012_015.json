    "message_2": "The distribution of dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe. Dark matter, which makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content, does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. However, it exerts gravitational influence on visible matter, and its distribution can be inferred through its effects on the motion of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nHere are some ways in which the distribution of dark matter affects the formation and evolution of large-scale structures:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: Dark matter provides the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Its distribution in the early universe created regions with higher density, which attracted more matter, both dark and visible. This led to the formation of large-scale structures through a process called gravitational collapse.\n\n2. Cosmic web: The distribution of dark matter forms a cosmic web-like structure, with filaments connecting galaxy clusters and voids where there is little or no dark matter. This cosmic web acts as a framework for the distribution of visible matter, with galaxies and galaxy clusters forming along the densest regions of the web.\n\n3. Galaxy rotation curves: The presence of dark matter in galaxies affects their rotation curves, which plot the orbital speeds of stars and gas as a function of their distance from the galaxy's center. Observations show that the rotation curves remain flat or even rise at large distances, indicating the presence of a significant amount of unseen mass, attributed to dark matter. This dark matter halo surrounding galaxies plays a vital role in their stability and evolution.\n\n4. Galaxy mergers and interactions: Dark matter also influences the interactions and mergers of galaxies. When two galaxies collide, their dark matter halos can interact, affecting the dynamics of the merger and the resulting galaxy's structure. These interactions can trigger star formation, redistribute gas and dust, and even alter the central supermassive black hole's activity.\n\n5. Large-scale structure evolution: Over time, the distribution of dark matter continues to influence the evolution of large-scale structures. As the universe expands, dark matter drives the growth of galaxy clusters and the formation of new galaxies through gravitational interactions. This ongoing process shapes the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today.\n\nIn summary, the distribution of dark matter is fundamental to the formation and evolution of large-scale structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe. Its gravitational influence drives the assembly of these structures and continues to shape their growth and interactions over cosmic time."
