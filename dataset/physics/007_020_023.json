    "message_2": "To calculate the half-life and the decay constant of the sample, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nActivity_final = Activity_initial * e^(-λ * time)\n\nwhere Activity_final is the final activity (500 Bq), Activity_initial is the initial activity (1000 Bq), λ is the decay constant, and time is the time elapsed (1 hour).\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant (λ). We can rearrange the formula to solve for λ:\n\nλ = -ln(Activity_final / Activity_initial) / time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = -ln(500 Bq / 1000 Bq) / 1 hour\nλ = -ln(0.5) / 1 hour\nλ ≈ 0.6931 / 1 hour\nλ ≈ 0.6931 h^(-1)\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can find the half-life (T_half) using the relationship between the decay constant and half-life:\n\nT_half = ln(2) / λ\n\nPlugging in the value for λ:\n\nT_half = ln(2) / 0.6931 h^(-1)\nT_half ≈ 1 hour\n\nSo, the half-life of the sample is approximately 1 hour, and the decay constant is approximately 0.6931 h^(-1)."
