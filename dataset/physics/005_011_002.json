    "message_2": "To find the relativistic mass of the proton, we need to use the following equation:\n\nm = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass of the proton, v is the velocity of the proton, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nm0 = 1.67 × 10^-27 kg\nv = 0.6c\nc = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, let's find v in terms of m/s:\nv = 0.6 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 1.8 × 10^8 m/s\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the equation:\n\nm = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - (1.8 × 10^8 m/s)^2 / (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nm = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - (3.24 × 10^16 m^2/s^2) / (9 × 10^16 m^2/s^2))\n\nm = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\nm = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / sqrt(0.64)\n\nm = (1.67 × 10^-27 kg) / 0.8\n\nm ≈ 2.0875 × 10^-27 kg\n\nSo, the relativistic mass of the proton when it is accelerated to a speed of 0.6c is approximately 2.0875 × 10^-27 kg."
