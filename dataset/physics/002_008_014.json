    "message_2": "To find the specific heat capacity (c) of aluminum, we can use the formula:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere q is the heat energy absorbed (4000 J), m is the mass of the aluminum (100 g), c is the specific heat capacity we want to find, and ΔT is the change in temperature (80°C - 20°C = 60°C).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for c, we get:\n\nc = q / (mΔT)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nc = 4000 J / (100 g × 60°C)\n\nc = 4000 J / 6000 g°C\n\nc = 0.6667 J/g°C\n\nThe specific heat capacity of aluminum is approximately 0.6667 J/g°C."
