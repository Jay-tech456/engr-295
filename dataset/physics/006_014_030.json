    "message_2": "To calculate the lifetime of the fourth excited state of a hydrogen atom, we need to consider the transition from the fourth excited state (n = 5) to the ground state (n = 1). The lifetime of an excited state is related to the spontaneous emission rate, which can be calculated using the Einstein A coefficient.\n\nThe Einstein A coefficient for a transition from an upper energy level n to a lower energy level m can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA(n→m) = (64π^4 e^2)/(3h c^3) * (Z^2 R^2) * (1/n^3) * (1/m^2) * f(n→m)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10^(-19) C), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), Z is the atomic number (Z = 1 for hydrogen), R is the Rydberg constant (1.097 × 10^7 m^(-1)), and f(n→m) is the oscillator strength for the transition.\n\nFor the transition from n = 5 to n = 1, the oscillator strength f(5→1) is approximately 0.416.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nA(5→1) = (64π^4 (1.602 × 10^(-19) C)^2)/(3(6.626 × 10^(-34) Js)(3 × 10^8 m/s)^3) * (1^2 (1.097 × 10^7 m^(-1))^2) * (1/5^3) * (1/1^2) * 0.416\nA(5→1) ≈ 4.7 × 10^7 s^(-1)\n\nThe lifetime τ of the fourth excited state is the inverse of the Einstein A coefficient:\n\nτ = 1/A(5→1)\nτ ≈ 1/(4.7 × 10^7 s^(-1))\nτ ≈ 2.13 × 10^(-8) s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the fourth excited state of a hydrogen atom is approximately 2.13 × 10^(-8) seconds."
