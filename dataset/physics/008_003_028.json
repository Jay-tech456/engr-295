    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a neutrino oscillation, we need to consider the mixing angles, mass differences, and the distance traveled by the neutrino. The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation is described by the PMNS (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) matrix, which includes three mixing angles (θ12, θ23, and θ13) and a CP-violating phase.\n\nThe probability of an electron neutrino (νe) changing into a muon neutrino (νμ) can be expressed as:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere:\nθ is the mixing angle between the electron and muon neutrino,\nΔm² is the difference in the squares of the masses of the neutrinos (in eV²),\nL is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km),\nE is the energy of the neutrino (in GeV), and\n1.27 is a conversion factor.\n\nFor this problem, we are given the distance L = 500 km. However, we do not have information about the energy of the neutrino, which is necessary to calculate the probability. Additionally, the mixing angles and mass differences are experimentally determined values that are subject to some uncertainty.\n\nUsing the current best-fit values for the mixing angles and mass differences, we can estimate the probability:\n\nθ ≈ 33.82° (θ13)\nΔm² ≈ 7.39 × 10⁻³ eV² (Δm²31)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(νe → νμ) = sin²(2 * 33.82°) * sin²(1.27 * 7.39 × 10⁻³ * 500 / E)\n\nWithout the energy value (E), we cannot provide a specific probability for this scenario. However, this formula can be used to calculate the probability once the energy of the neutrino is known."
