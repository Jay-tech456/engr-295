    "message_2": "According to the laws of black hole thermodynamics, the entropy of a black hole is directly proportional to its surface area. This relationship is described by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which states that the entropy (S) of a black hole is given by:\n\nS = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nwhere A is the surface area of the black hole's event horizon, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nAs the surface area of a black hole increases, its entropy also increases, and vice versa. This relationship implies that black holes with larger surface areas have more possible microstates and are therefore more disordered. The proportionality between entropy and surface area is a key aspect of black hole thermodynamics and has important implications for our understanding of gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of information in the universe."
