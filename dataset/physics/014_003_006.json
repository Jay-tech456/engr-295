    "message_1": "In which temperature range and at what wavelength does the cosmic microwave background radiation peak, and what does this imply about the age and expansion rate of the universe?",
    "message_2": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation peaks at a temperature of approximately 2.725 K (Kelvin) and a wavelength of around 1.9 mm. This peak is described by the Planck's law of black-body radiation, which states that the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body at a given temperature is a function of wavelength.\n\nThe CMB radiation is a relic from the early universe, and its temperature and wavelength provide crucial information about the age and expansion rate of the universe. The fact that the CMB radiation has a well-defined peak and follows the black-body radiation curve implies that the universe was once in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB radiation has been decreasing over time due to the expansion of the universe. By measuring the current temperature and using the known physics of the early universe, scientists can estimate the age of the universe. The current best estimate for the age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years.\n\nThe expansion rate of the universe can be described by the Hubble constant, which relates the recessional velocity of galaxies to their distance from us. Observations of the CMB radiation, along with other cosmological data, have allowed scientists to determine the value of the Hubble constant. The current best estimate for the Hubble constant is around 67.4 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec).\n\nIn summary, the peak temperature and wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation provide crucial information about the age and expansion rate of the universe, supporting the idea that the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since."
