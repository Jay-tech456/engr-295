    "message_1": "A convex lens with a focal length of 10 cm is being used as a magnifying glass. However, when the object is placed at a distance of 5 cm from the lens, the image produced is blurred and distorted. Determine the type of aberration occurring in the lens and calculate the distance of the object from the lens where a clear image can be obtained.",
    "message_2": "The problem described here is likely due to spherical aberration. Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through the outer regions of a lens converge at a different point than the rays passing through the central region of the lens. This results in a blurred and distorted image.\n\nTo find the distance where a clear image can be obtained, we can use the lens maker's formula:\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance.\n\nSince we want a clear image, we need to find the object distance (u) that will produce an image at the focal point (v = f). This will minimize the effect of spherical aberration.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/u + 1/10\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for u:\n\n1/u = 1/10 - 1/10\n1/u = 0\n\nThis equation implies that there is no object distance that will produce a clear image at the focal point due to the spherical aberration. However, we can still try to minimize the effect of spherical aberration by placing the object closer to the lens. In practice, this means that the object should be placed at a distance slightly less than the focal length (u < 10 cm) to minimize the effect of spherical aberration and obtain a clearer image. The exact distance will depend on the specific lens and the severity of the spherical aberration."
