    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * ω² * r) / (c⁴ * D)\n\nwhere:\nh = amplitude of the gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\nM = total mass of the binary system (in kg)\nω = angular frequency of the binary system (in rad/s)\nr = separation distance between the black holes (in meters)\nc = speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\nD = distance from the observer to the binary system (in meters)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms:\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg\n10 solar masses = 10 * 1.989 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.989 × 10³¹ kg\n\nSince there are two black holes with equal masses, the total mass of the binary system is:\n\nM = 2 * 1.989 × 10³¹ kg = 3.978 × 10³¹ kg\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use Kepler's third law to find the orbital period T:\n\nT² = (4 * π² * r³) / (G * M)\n\nwhere r is the separation distance between the black holes. We need to convert the given distance of 1000 km to meters:\n\nr = 1000 km * 1000 m/km = 1 × 10⁶ m\n\nNow we can find the orbital period T:\n\nT² = (4 * π² * (1 × 10⁶ m)³) / (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 3.978 × 10³¹ kg)\nT = √(T²) ≈ 0.00043 s\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the orbital period T by:\n\nω = 2 * π / T\n\nω ≈ 2 * π / 0.00043 s ≈ 14579 rad/s\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves h. Let's assume the observer is at a distance D = 1 Mpc (1 Mpc = 3.086 × 10²² m) from the binary system:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 3.978 × 10³¹ kg * (14579 rad/s)² * 1 × 10⁶ m) / ((2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴ * 3.086 × 10²² m)\nh ≈ 1.36 × 10⁻²²\n\nThe amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary black hole system is approximately 1.36 × 10⁻²²."
