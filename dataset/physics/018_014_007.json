    "message_1": "\"A high-energy physics experiment involves studying the behavior of particles near strong gravitational fields. If a black hole with a mass of 10^31 kg is located at a distance of 1 AU from Earth, what is the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves that could be detected on Earth assuming a distance of 100 Mpc from the black hole?\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves detected on Earth, we can use the formula for the strain amplitude of a gravitational wave:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * c) / (r * c^2)\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole (10^31 kg), r is the distance from the black hole to Earth (100 Mpc), and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from the black hole to Earth from Mpc to meters. 1 Mpc is equal to 3.086 × 10^22 meters. So, 100 Mpc is equal to 3.086 × 10^24 meters.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 10^31 kg * 2.998 × 10^8 m/s) / (3.086 × 10^24 m * (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2)\n\nh ≈ (4 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 * 10^31 * 2.998 × 10^8) / (3.086 × 10^24 * (2.998 × 10^8)^2)\n\nh ≈ (8.013 × 10^28) / (9.246 × 10^40)\n\nh ≈ 8.66 × 10^-13\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves that could be detected on Earth from a black hole with a mass of 10^31 kg located at a distance of 100 Mpc is approximately 8.66 × 10^-13."
