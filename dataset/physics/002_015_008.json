    "message_1": "A heat pump is used to maintain a room temperature of 25°C while the surroundings are at a constant temperature of 5°C. If the heat pump has a coefficient of performance of 4, calculate the amount of heat absorbed from the cold reservoir and the amount of heat rejected to the hot reservoir when 10,000 J of work is applied to the heat pump.",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is given by the formula:\n\nCOP = Q_h / W\n\nwhere Q_h is the amount of heat rejected to the hot reservoir, W is the work applied to the heat pump, and COP is the coefficient of performance.\n\nWe are given that the COP is 4 and the work applied to the heat pump is 10,000 J. We can rearrange the formula to solve for Q_h:\n\nQ_h = COP * W\nQ_h = 4 * 10,000 J\nQ_h = 40,000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat rejected to the hot reservoir is 40,000 J.\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy principle to find the amount of heat absorbed from the cold reservoir (Q_c). The conservation of energy states that the total energy input (work applied, W) plus the heat absorbed from the cold reservoir (Q_c) is equal to the heat rejected to the hot reservoir (Q_h):\n\nW + Q_c = Q_h\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for Q_c:\n\nQ_c = Q_h - W\nQ_c = 40,000 J - 10,000 J\nQ_c = 30,000 J\n\nSo, the amount of heat absorbed from the cold reservoir is 30,000 J."
