    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum angle of deflection of light passing near a black hole, we can use the formula for gravitational lensing. The formula for the deflection angle (α) is given by:\n\nα = 4 * GM / (c^2 * b)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and b is the impact parameter, which is the closest distance the light gets to the black hole.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole from solar masses to kilograms. One solar mass is approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kg. So, the mass of the black hole is:\n\nM = 10 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg = 1.989 x 10^31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole, which is the radius of the event horizon. The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is:\n\nRs = 2 * GM / c^2\n\nRs = 2 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 x 10^4 m\n\nFor maximum deflection, the impact parameter (b) is equal to the Schwarzschild radius (Rs). Now we can calculate the deflection angle (α):\n\nα = 4 * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (1.989 x 10^31 kg) / ((3 x 10^8 m/s)^2 * 2.95 x 10^4 m)\nα ≈ 8.84 x 10^-6 radians\n\nTo convert radians to arcseconds, we can use the conversion factor 1 radian ≈ 206,265 arcseconds:\n\nα ≈ 8.84 x 10^-6 * 206,265 arcseconds/radian\nα ≈ 1.82 arcseconds\n\nSo, the maximum angle of deflection of light passing near a black hole with a mass of 10 solar masses, located at a distance of 10,000 light-years from Earth, is approximately 1.82 arcseconds."
