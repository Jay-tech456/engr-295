    "message_1": "What is the minimum angle of incidence at which an optical fiber with a refractive index of 1.5 can undergo total internal reflection if the surrounding medium has a refractive index of 1.2?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection, we can use Snell's Law and the critical angle formula. Snell's Law states that:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nFor total internal reflection to occur, the angle of refraction (θ2) must be 90 degrees. Therefore, we can rewrite Snell's Law as:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nn1 * sin(θ1) = n2\n\nNow, we can solve for the critical angle (θ1) using the given refractive indices:\n\n1.5 * sin(θ1) = 1.2\n\nsin(θ1) = 1.2 / 1.5\n\nsin(θ1) = 0.8\n\nTo find the critical angle, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.8:\n\nθ1 = arcsin(0.8)\n\nθ1 ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nSo, the minimum angle of incidence for total internal reflection in this optical fiber is approximately 53.13 degrees."
