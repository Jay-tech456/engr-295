    "message_2": "Dark Matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is believed to make up a significant portion of the total mass in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to electromagnetic radiation. The evidence for the existence of Dark Matter comes from various astrophysical and cosmological observations, which suggest that there is more mass in the universe than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. Some of the key evidence includes:\n\n1. Galaxy rotation curves: Observations of the rotational speeds of galaxies show that stars and gas in the outer regions of galaxies are moving faster than expected based on the visible mass. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a massive, invisible halo of Dark Matter surrounding the galaxies, providing the additional gravitational force needed to keep the outer stars and gas in their orbits.\n\n2. Gravitational lensing: The bending of light from distant galaxies as it passes through the gravitational field of massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, can be used to map the distribution of mass in the universe. These maps reveal that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of Dark Matter.\n\n3. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation: The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements of the CMB's temperature fluctuations reveal a specific pattern that is consistent with the presence of Dark Matter, which would have influenced the distribution of matter in the early universe.\n\n4. Large-scale structure formation: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is consistent with the influence of Dark Matter, which would have acted as a gravitational \"glue\" to help form these large-scale structures.\n\nThese observations provide strong evidence for the existence of Dark Matter, but its exact nature and composition remain unknown. Within the framework of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories, several candidates for Dark Matter particles have been proposed. Some of the most popular candidates include:\n\n1. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact with other matter through the weak nuclear force and gravity. They are massive enough to account for the observed gravitational effects of Dark Matter and are a natural extension of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n2. Axions: Axions are hypothetical particles that were initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are much lighter than WIMPs and interact very weakly with other particles, making them a viable Dark Matter candidate.\n\n3. Sterile neutrinos: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the weak nuclear force, unlike the known neutrinos in the Standard Model. They could be produced in the early universe and contribute to the Dark Matter density.\n\n4. Supersymmetric particles: Supersymmetry is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model that predicts the existence of partner particles for each known particle. Some of these supersymmetric particles, such as the neutralino, could be stable and serve as Dark Matter candidates.\n\nDespite extensive experimental searches, none of these BSM Dark Matter candidates have been directly detected so far. However, the ongoing efforts to detect and study Dark Matter will continue to shape our understanding of particle physics and the fundamental nature of the universe."
