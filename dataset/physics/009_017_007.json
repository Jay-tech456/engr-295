    "message_2": "To determine the angle and distance between the first minimum and the third maximum, we need to use the formula for the angular position of minima and maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern.\n\nFor minima:\nθ_min = (m * λ) / a\n\nFor maxima:\nθ_max = [(2n + 1) * λ] / (2 * a)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position, m and n are integers representing the order of the minima and maxima, λ is the wavelength of the light, and a is the width of the slit.\n\nGiven:\nλ = 600 nm = 600 × 10^(-9) m\na = 0.1 mm = 0.1 × 10^(-3) m\nDistance from the slit, L = 2 m\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular positions of the first minimum (m = 1) and the third maximum (n = 2).\n\nθ_min1 = (1 * 600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.1 × 10^(-3))\nθ_min1 = 6 × 10^(-6) rad\n\nθ_max3 = [(2 * 2 + 1) * 600 × 10^(-9)] / (2 * 0.1 × 10^(-3))\nθ_max3 = (5 * 600 × 10^(-9)) / (0.2 × 10^(-3))\nθ_max3 = 15 × 10^(-6) rad\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in the angular positions:\nΔθ = θ_max3 - θ_min1\nΔθ = 15 × 10^(-6) - 6 × 10^(-6)\nΔθ = 9 × 10^(-6) rad\n\nTo find the distance between the first minimum and the third maximum on the screen, we can use the formula:\nDistance = L * tan(Δθ)\n\nSince Δθ is very small, we can use the small-angle approximation:\ntan(Δθ) ≈ Δθ\n\nDistance = 2 * 9 × 10^(-6)\nDistance = 18 × 10^(-6) m\nDistance = 18 μm\n\nSo, the angle between the first minimum and the third maximum is approximately 9 × 10^(-6) radians, and the distance between them on the screen is approximately 18 μm."
