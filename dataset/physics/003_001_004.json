    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 0.03 m from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, specifically the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\nB is the magnetic field strength,\nμ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A),\nI is the current in the wire (6.0 A),\nr is the distance from the wire (0.03 m).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6.0 A) / (2 * π * 0.03 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 6.0 A) / (2 * 0.03 m)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB = (2.4 × 10^(-6) Tm) / 0.06 m\n\nB ≈ 4.0 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 0.03 m from the wire is approximately 4.0 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
