    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a tube:\n\nQ = (π * R^4 * ΔP) / (8 * η * L)\n\nwhere:\nQ = volumetric flow rate (m^3/s)\nR = radius of the tube (m)\nΔP = pressure difference between the two ends of the tube (Pa)\nη = viscosity of the fluid (Pa.s)\nL = length of the tube (m)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to the appropriate units:\n\nLength (L) = 50 cm = 0.5 m\nRadius (R) = 4 mm = 0.004 m\nViscosity (η) = 1.5 Pa.s\nPressure difference (ΔP) = 4000 Pa\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n\nQ = (π * (0.004)^4 * 4000) / (8 * 1.5 * 0.5)\nQ = (π * 2.56 * 10^-7 * 4000) / (6)\nQ = (3.14159 * 2.56 * 10^-7 * 4000) / (6)\nQ ≈ 5.36 * 10^-7 m^3/s\n\nSo, the volumetric flow rate of glycerin in the tube is approximately 5.36 * 10^-7 m^3/s."
