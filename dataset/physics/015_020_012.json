    "message_2": "To estimate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a population of binary white dwarfs, we need to consider the characteristics of the binary system, such as the masses of the white dwarfs and their orbital period.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (G * (M1 + M2) / a^3)^(1/2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M1 and M2 are the masses of the two white dwarfs, and a is the semi-major axis of their orbit.\n\nSince we are dealing with a population of binary white dwarfs, we would need to know the distribution of their masses and orbital periods to calculate an expected frequency. However, we can provide a rough estimate based on typical values for these parameters.\n\nWhite dwarfs typically have masses between 0.5 and 1.4 solar masses (M☉). Let's assume an average mass of 0.7 M☉ for both white dwarfs in the binary system. The orbital period of binary white dwarfs can range from a few minutes to several hours. Let's assume an average orbital period of 1 hour.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the orbital period to the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * (M1 + M2))\n\nwhere P is the orbital period. Rearranging for a:\n\na = ((G * (M1 + M2) * P^2) / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)\n\nAssuming M1 = M2 = 0.7 M☉ and P = 1 hour, we can calculate the semi-major axis:\n\na = ((6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg) * (3600 s)^2) / (4 * π^2))^(1/3)\na ≈ 1.44 x 10^9 m\n\nNow we can calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves:\n\nf = (1 / π) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * (1.4 * 1.989 x 10^30 kg) / (1.44 x 10^9 m)^3)^(1/2)\nf ≈ 6.24 x 10^-4 Hz\n\nThe expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a population of binary white dwarfs located 500 parsecs away from Earth is approximately 6.24 x 10^-4 Hz.\n\nThe frequency of gravitational waves does not change with respect to the distance of the binary system from Earth. However, the amplitude of the gravitational waves decreases with increasing distance, making them more challenging to detect. The amplitude of the gravitational waves is inversely proportional to the distance from the source, so if the binary system were twice as far away, the amplitude would be half as large."
