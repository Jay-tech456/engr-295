    "message_2": "To find the location and magnification of the image formed by a concave lens, we can use the lens formula and the magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven, the focal length (f) is -20 cm and the object distance (u) is -10 cm (it's negative because the object is on the same side as the image for a concave lens).\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\n1/(-20) = 1/v - 1/(-10)\n\n-1/20 = 1/v + 1/10\n\nMultiplying both sides by -20:\n\n1 = -2/v - 1\n\nNow, add 1 to both sides:\n\n2 = -2/v\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n-1 = 1/v\n\nSo, v = -10 cm\n\nThe image is formed 10 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (M) using the magnification formula:\n\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(-10)/(-10)\n\nM = 10/10\n\nM = 1\n\nThe magnification of the image is 1, which means the image is the same size as the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is formed 10 cm in front of the lens on the same side as the object, and the magnification is 1, meaning the image is the same size as the object."
