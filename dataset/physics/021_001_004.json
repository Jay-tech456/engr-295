    "message_2": "The lifetime of a black hole depends on its initial mass through a process called Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is the emission of particles from a black hole due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This process causes the black hole to lose mass and eventually evaporate.\n\nThe lifetime of a black hole (τ) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nτ ≈ (M^3 * G^2) / (ħ * c^4)\n\nwhere M is the initial mass of the black hole, G is the gravitational constant, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the lifetime of a black hole is proportional to the cube of its initial mass. This means that more massive black holes will have longer lifetimes, while less massive black holes will evaporate more quickly.\n\nDuring the evolution of a black hole, its properties change as it loses mass due to Hawking radiation. As the black hole loses mass, its event horizon (the boundary beyond which nothing can escape) shrinks. This causes the black hole's temperature to increase, as the temperature is inversely proportional to the mass:\n\nT = (ħ * c^3) / (8 * π * G * M * k_B)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nAs the black hole's temperature increases, it emits Hawking radiation at a faster rate, causing it to lose mass more quickly. This process continues until the black hole has lost all of its mass and evaporates completely.\n\nIn summary, the lifetime of a black hole depends on its initial mass, with more massive black holes having longer lifetimes. During its evolution, a black hole loses mass due to Hawking radiation, causing its event horizon to shrink and its temperature to increase. This leads to an increased rate of mass loss until the black hole eventually evaporates."
