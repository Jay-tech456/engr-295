    "message_2": "To find the position, size, and nature of the image formed by a concave mirror, we can use the mirror formula and magnification formula.\n\nMirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v\nMagnification formula: m = -v/u\n\nHere, f is the focal length of the mirror, u is the object distance (distance of the object from the mirror), and v is the image distance (distance of the image from the mirror). The magnification, m, is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object.\n\nGiven:\nFocal length, f = -10 cm (concave mirror has a negative focal length)\nObject distance, u = -20 cm (object is placed in front of the mirror, so the distance is negative)\n\nNow, we can use the mirror formula to find the image distance (v):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n1/(-10) = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n\nMultiplying both sides by -20v to eliminate fractions:\n\n-2v = -v + 20\nv = 20 cm\n\nThe image distance is positive, which means the image is formed on the same side as the object, and it is a real image.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification (m):\n\nm = -v/u\nm = -20 / (-20)\nm = 1\n\nThe magnification is 1, which means the size of the image is the same as the size of the object.\n\nIn summary, the image formed by the concave mirror is a real image, located 20 cm in front of the mirror, and has the same size as the object."
