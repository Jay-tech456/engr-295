    "message_2": "To determine the image distance and magnification of the object, we can use the mirror equation and the magnification equation.\n\nThe mirror equation is given by:\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nFor a concave mirror, the focal length (f) is half of the radius of curvature (R):\nf = R/2 = 15 cm / 2 = 7.5 cm\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the mirror equation:\n1/7.5 = 1/10 + 1/di\n\nTo solve for di, we can first find the common denominator:\n(10*di) = 10*7.5 + 10*di\n\nNow, subtract 10*di from both sides:\n10*7.5 = -3*di\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\ndi = -25 cm\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is on the same side as the object, which means it's a virtual image. So, the image distance is 25 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the magnification using the magnification equation:\nM = -di/do\n\nPlug in the values:\nM = -(-25)/10\nM = 2.5\n\nThe magnification is 2.5, which means the image is 2.5 times larger than the object. Since the magnification is positive, the image is upright."
