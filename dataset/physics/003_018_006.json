    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point on the axis of the helix, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, R is the radius of the helix, and x is the distance from the center of the helix.\n\nSince there are 10 turns in the helix, the total magnetic field will be 10 times the magnetic field due to a single loop.\n\nFirst, let's convert the radius and distance to meters:\n\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nx = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB_single_loop = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * (0.05 m)²) / (2 * ((0.05 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB_single_loop ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSince there are 10 turns, the total magnetic field is:\n\nB_total = 10 * B_single_loop\nB_total ≈ 1.2566 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current flow around the helix, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be parallel to the axis of the helix.\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point located on the axis of the helix, 10 cm away from its center, is approximately 1.2566 × 10^(-6) T, and its direction is parallel to the axis of the helix."
