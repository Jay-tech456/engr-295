    "message_2": "To determine the minimum energy required to excite the photopigment molecule, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the incident light (498 nm).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\nλ = 498 nm * (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 498 x 10^-9 m\n\nNow we can calculate the energy of the photon:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (498 x 10^-9 m)\nE ≈ 3.99 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we need to convert the energy from joules to electron volts (eV). We know that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so:\n\nE ≈ (3.99 x 10^-19 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) ≈ 2.49 eV\n\nSince the activation energy of the photopigment molecule is 1.8 eV, the incident light with a wavelength of 498 nm and energy of 2.49 eV is sufficient to excite the molecule. Therefore, the minimum energy required to excite the photopigment molecule in the human eye's rod cells is 1.8 eV."
