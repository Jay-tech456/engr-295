    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for neutrino oscillations in matter, which takes into account the MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect. The formula for the probability of oscillation is:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ13) * sin²(Δm² * L / 4E)\n\nwhere:\nθ13 is the mixing angle (0.15 radians)\nΔm² is the squared mass difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates (in eV²)\nL is the distance the neutrino travels (500 km)\nE is the initial energy of the neutrino (3 GeV)\n\nHowever, we need the value of Δm² to proceed with the calculation. The most recent measurements of the squared mass differences are:\n\nΔm²21 = 7.53 × 10⁻⁵ eV²\nΔm²31 = 2.53 × 10⁻³ eV²\n\nSince we are dealing with muon neutrinos oscillating into electron neutrinos, we will use the value of Δm²31.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.15) * sin²((2.53 × 10⁻³ eV²) * (500 × 10³ m) / (4 * 3 × 10⁹ eV))\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(0.3) * sin²((2.53 × 10⁻³ eV²) * (500 × 10³ m) / (12 × 10⁹ eV))\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.0227 * sin²(5.29 × 10⁻²)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.0227 * 0.0027\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 6.13 × 10⁻⁵\n\nSo, the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino after traversing a distance of 500 km through matter with an initial energy of 3 GeV and a mixing angle of θ13 = 0.15 radians is approximately 6.13 × 10⁻⁵ or 0.00613%."
