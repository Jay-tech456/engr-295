    "message_2": "Spectroscopy is a powerful tool in astrophysics that allows us to study the properties of celestial objects, including exoplanets, by analyzing the light they emit, absorb, or reflect. There are several spectroscopic techniques used to detect and characterize exoplanets orbiting distant stars:\n\n1. Transit spectroscopy: When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star (a transit), it causes a small dip in the star's brightness. During this transit, some of the star's light passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, and the atmosphere absorbs specific wavelengths of light depending on its composition. By comparing the spectrum of the star during the transit to the spectrum when the exoplanet is not transiting, we can identify the wavelengths absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere and determine its chemical composition.\n\n2. Emission spectroscopy: When an exoplanet orbits close to its host star, it can become heated to high temperatures, causing it to emit its own light. By analyzing the spectrum of this emitted light, we can learn about the exoplanet's temperature and atmospheric composition.\n\n3. Reflection spectroscopy: Exoplanets also reflect light from their host stars. By analyzing the spectrum of this reflected light, we can study the exoplanet's atmosphere and surface properties. For example, the presence of certain gases in the atmosphere can cause specific absorption features in the reflected spectrum, while the surface composition can affect the overall reflectivity of the exoplanet.\n\n4. Radial velocity spectroscopy: As an exoplanet orbits its host star, it causes the star to wobble slightly due to their mutual gravitational attraction. This wobble results in a Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, which can be measured to determine the exoplanet's mass and orbital properties. In some cases, the exoplanet's atmosphere can also cause a Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, providing information about the exoplanet's atmospheric composition.\n\n5. Direct imaging spectroscopy: In rare cases, exoplanets can be directly imaged using advanced telescopes and imaging techniques. By analyzing the spectrum of the directly imaged exoplanet, we can study its atmospheric composition, temperature, and surface properties.\n\nBy combining these spectroscopic techniques with other observational methods, we can detect and characterize exoplanets orbiting distant stars, providing valuable insights into their atmospheres, surfaces, and potential habitability."
