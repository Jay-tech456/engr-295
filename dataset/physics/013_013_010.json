    "message_2": "There isn't a specific minimum mass required for a neutron star to become a pulsar. Pulsars are simply rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles. The key factor for a neutron star to become a pulsar is its rotation rate, not its mass.\n\nHowever, the minimum mass required for a neutron star to form in the first place is around 1.1 to 1.4 solar masses (Mâ˜‰). If a neutron star has a strong magnetic field and rotates rapidly, it can become a pulsar. The mass of the neutron star does not necessarily determine whether it will become a pulsar or not."
