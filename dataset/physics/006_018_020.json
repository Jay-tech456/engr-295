    "message_2": "The Auger effect is a phenomenon in which an electron from an outer shell fills a vacancy in an inner shell, and the excess energy is transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. However, in a hydrogen atom, there is only one electron orbiting the nucleus, and there are no inner and outer shells like in heavier elements. Therefore, the Auger effect cannot occur in a hydrogen atom.\n\nAs for electron capture, it is a process in which a proton in the nucleus captures an electron from an inner shell, transforming into a neutron and emitting a neutrino. Since hydrogen has only one proton and one electron, electron capture would result in the formation of a neutron, and the hydrogen atom would cease to exist. Consequently, there would be no possibility of an Auger transition between K and L shells in a hydrogen atom.\n\nIn summary, the probability of the Auger effect occurring in a hydrogen atom that has just undergone electron capture is zero, and it is not possible to calculate the energy and wavelength of the emitted photon in this case."
