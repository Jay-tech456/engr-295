    "message_2": "To find the lifetime of the excited state, we can use the following formula:\n\nτ = ħ / Γ\n\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the excited state, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), and Γ is the decay rate.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy difference between the n=3 and n=2 energy levels in the hydrogen atom. We can use the Rydberg formula for hydrogen:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, n1 and n2 are the initial and final energy levels, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen. Plugging in the values:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/3^2) ≈ -1.89 eV\n\nNow, we need to convert this energy difference to Joules:\n\nΔE = -1.89 eV * (1.602176634 × 10^-19 J/eV) ≈ -3.03 × 10^-19 J\n\nNext, we can find the frequency of the emitted photon using the energy difference and Planck's constant (h = 6.62607015 × 10^-34 Js):\n\nν = ΔE / h ≈ (-3.03 × 10^-19 J) / (6.62607015 × 10^-34 Js) ≈ 4.57 × 10^14 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the decay rate (Γ) using the frequency and the wavelength of the emitted photon:\n\nΓ = 2πν = 2π(4.57 × 10^14 Hz) ≈ 2.87 × 10^15 s^-1\n\nFinally, we can find the lifetime of the excited state using the formula:\n\nτ = ħ / Γ ≈ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2.87 × 10^15 s^-1) ≈ 3.67 × 10^-50 s\n\nSo, the lifetime of the excited state in a hydrogen atom that has undergone a transition from the n=3 to n=2 energy level and emitted a photon with a wavelength of 656.3 nm is approximately 3.67 × 10^-50 seconds."
