    "message_2": "To calculate the escape velocity from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use the formula for escape velocity:\n\nv_esc = √(2 * G * M / r)\n\nwhere v_esc is the escape velocity, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the galaxy, and r is the distance from the center of the galaxy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the galaxy to kilograms and the radius to meters.\n\n1 solar mass = 1.989 × 10^30 kg\n1 trillion solar masses = 1 × 10^12 solar masses = 1 × 10^12 * 1.989 × 10^30 kg = 1.989 × 10^42 kg\n\n1 light-year = 9.461 × 10^15 meters\n50,000 light-years = 50,000 * 9.461 × 10^15 meters = 4.7305 × 10^20 meters\n\nNow we can plug these values into the escape velocity formula:\n\nv_esc = √(2 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.989 × 10^42 kg / 4.7305 × 10^20 m)\n\nv_esc = √(2 * 6.67430 × 10^-11 * 1.989 × 10^42 / 4.7305 × 10^20)\n\nv_esc ≈ √(2.646 × 10^31 / 4.7305 × 10^20)\n\nv_esc ≈ √(5.599 × 10^10)\n\nv_esc ≈ 2.37 × 10^5 m/s\n\nThe escape velocity from the center of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 237,000 meters per second (m/s) or 237 km/s."
