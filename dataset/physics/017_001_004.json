    "message_2": "The effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor material is quite significant. As temperature increases, the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor also increases. This behavior is opposite to that of metals, where an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in electrical conductivity.\n\nThe relationship between temperature and electrical conductivity in semiconductors can be explained by examining their band structure. In semiconductors, there is a valence band, which is filled with electrons, and a conduction band, which is initially empty. The energy gap between these two bands is called the bandgap.\n\nAt absolute zero temperature, all the electrons in a semiconductor are in the valence band, and there are no free electrons available for conduction. However, as the temperature increases, some of the electrons gain enough thermal energy to overcome the bandgap and jump from the valence band to the conduction band. This process is called thermal excitation.\n\nWhen an electron moves from the valence band to the conduction band, it leaves behind a vacancy, or \"hole,\" in the valence band. Both the free electrons in the conduction band and the holes in the valence band contribute to the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor.\n\nAs the temperature increases, more electrons are thermally excited into the conduction band, and more holes are created in the valence band. This results in an increase in the number of charge carriers (electrons and holes) available for conduction, which in turn leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor material.\n\nIn summary, the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor material increases with temperature due to the thermal excitation of electrons across the bandgap, resulting in an increased number of charge carriers available for conduction. This behavior is directly related to the band structure of the material and the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands."
