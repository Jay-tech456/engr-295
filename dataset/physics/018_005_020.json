    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, we can use the formula for two-flavor neutrino oscillations:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2θ) * sin²(1.27 * Δm² * L / E)\n\nwhere P(νμ → νe) is the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino, θ is the mixing angle, Δm² is the difference in the squares of the neutrino masses (in eV²), L is the distance traveled by the neutrino (in km), and E is the initial energy of the neutrino (in GeV).\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nθ = 35°\nL = 730 km\nE = 1 GeV\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mixing angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ_rad = (35° * π) / 180 ≈ 0.610865 radians\n\nNow, we need to find the value of Δm². The most recent global fit values for the neutrino mass-squared differences are:\n\nΔm²_21 ≈ 7.5 x 10^(-5) eV²\nΔm²_31 ≈ 2.5 x 10^(-3) eV²\n\nSince we are considering muon neutrinos oscillating into electron neutrinos, we will use Δm²_21:\n\nΔm² = 7.5 x 10^(-5) eV²\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(νμ → νe) = sin²(2 * 0.610865) * sin²(1.27 * 7.5 x 10^(-5) * 730 / 1)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.974 * sin²(0.069)\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.974 * 0.0048\n\nP(νμ → νe) ≈ 0.0047\n\nSo, the probability of a muon neutrino oscillating into an electron neutrino after traveling a distance of 730 km through the Earth's crust in vacuum, with an initial energy of 1 GeV and a mixing angle of 35 degrees, is approximately 0.47%."
