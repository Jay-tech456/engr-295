    "message_2": "I cannot draw a ray diagram here, but I can guide you through the process of drawing one and determining the position, size, and nature of the image formed by the lens.\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line to represent the principal axis of the lens. Place a vertical arrow on the left side of the line to represent the object, 20 cm away from the lens.\n\n2. Draw a vertical line in the middle of the principal axis to represent the lens. Mark the focal points (F1 and F2) on both sides of the lens, 10 cm away from it.\n\n3. Draw three rays from the top of the object arrow:\n\n   a. The first ray should be parallel to the principal axis and pass through the lens. After passing through the lens, it should go through the focal point F2 on the right side of the lens.\n\n   b. The second ray should pass through the center of the lens without any deviation.\n\n   c. The third ray should pass through the focal point F1 on the left side of the lens and then become parallel to the principal axis after passing through the lens.\n\n4. The point where all three rays intersect on the right side of the lens is the position of the image. Draw a vertical arrow from this point to the principal axis to represent the image.\n\nNow, to determine the position, size, and nature of the image:\n\n1. Measure the distance between the image arrow and the lens. This is the image distance (v).\n\n2. Measure the height of the image arrow and compare it to the height of the object arrow. This will give you the size of the image relative to the object.\n\n3. Observe the orientation of the image arrow. If it points in the same direction as the object arrow, the image is upright. If it points in the opposite direction, the image is inverted.\n\n4. Since the image is formed on the opposite side of the lens from the object, it is a real image.\n\nUsing the lens formula, you can also calculate the image distance (v) and magnification (M):\n\n1/f = 1/u + 1/v\n\nwhere f is the focal length (10 cm), u is the object distance (-20 cm, negative since it's on the left side of the lens), and v is the image distance.\n\n1/10 = 1/(-20) + 1/v\n1/v = 1/10 + 1/20\n1/v = 3/20\nv = 20/3 cm (approximately 6.67 cm)\n\nThe image is formed approximately 6.67 cm away from the lens on the right side.\n\nFor magnification (M):\nM = -v/u\n\nM = -(20/3)/(-20)\nM = 1/3\n\nThe image is 1/3 the size of the object and inverted, confirming the nature of the image as real and inverted."
