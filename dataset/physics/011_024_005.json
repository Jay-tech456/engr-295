    "message_2": "The electronic structure of a topological insulator (TI) differs from a conventional insulator in the way the electronic states are arranged in the material. In a conventional insulator, the valence band is completely filled, and the conduction band is empty, with a significant energy gap between them. This energy gap prevents the flow of electric current, making the material an insulator.\n\nTopological insulators, on the other hand, have a similar bulk electronic structure with a filled valence band and an empty conduction band separated by an energy gap. However, the key difference lies in the presence of topologically protected surface states that cross the bulk energy gap. These surface states form a Dirac cone-like dispersion, where the valence and conduction bands touch at a single point called the Dirac point.\n\nThe topological protection of these surface states arises from the non-trivial topology of the bulk electronic wavefunctions, which can be characterized by a topological invariant called the Z2 invariant. The Z2 invariant can take values of 0 (trivial) or 1 (non-trivial), and materials with a non-trivial Z2 invariant exhibit topologically protected surface states.\n\nThe presence of these surface states has significant implications for the conductivity properties of topological insulators. While the bulk of the material remains insulating, the surface states allow for the flow of electric current along the surface. These surface states are characterized by spin-momentum locking, where the electron's spin is locked perpendicular to its momentum. This unique property leads to the suppression of backscattering and makes the surface states robust against non-magnetic impurities, resulting in highly conductive surface states.\n\nOne of the key experimental evidence for topological insulators is the observation of the quantum spin Hall effect in two-dimensional (2D) TIs, such as HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. In this system, the edge states exhibit quantized conductance, which is a direct consequence of the topological nature of the electronic states.\n\nIn three-dimensional (3D) TIs, such as Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to directly observe the Dirac cone-like dispersion of the surface states. Additionally, the observation of the weak antilocalization effect in magneto-transport measurements is another signature of the topological surface states in 3D TIs.\n\nIn summary, the electronic structure of a topological insulator differs from a conventional insulator due to the presence of topologically protected surface states that cross the bulk energy gap. These surface states lead to unique conductivity properties, with insulating bulk and highly conductive surface states characterized by spin-momentum locking. Experimental evidence, such as the quantum spin Hall effect in 2D TIs and ARPES measurements in 3D TIs, confirms the existence of these topological surface states."
