    "message_2": "The Bohr radius (a₀) is the most probable distance between the proton and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It can be calculated using the following formula:\n\na₀ = (4πε₀ħ²) / (m_e * e²)\n\nwhere:\nε₀ = vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²)\nħ = reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)\nm_e = electron mass (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\ne = elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na₀ = (4π * 8.854 x 10^-12 * (1.054 x 10^-34)²) / (9.109 x 10^-31 * (1.6 x 10^-19)²)\n\na₀ ≈ 5.291 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom is approximately 5.291 x 10^-11 meters."
