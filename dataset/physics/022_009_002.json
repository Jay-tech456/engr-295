    "message_2": "Dark matter annihilation or decay can potentially affect the observed spectrum of photons in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by injecting additional energy into the photon-baryon plasma during the early universe. This additional energy can alter the ionization history of the universe and distort the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. Here, we will discuss the relevant equations and observations related to this effect.\n\n1. Dark matter annihilation or decay:\nDark matter (DM) particles can annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles, such as photons, electrons, and neutrinos. The energy injection rate per unit volume from DM annihilation (Q) can be expressed as:\n\nQ = ⟨σv⟩ρ_DM^2 / (2m_DM)\n\nwhere ⟨σv⟩ is the thermally averaged annihilation cross-section times the relative velocity of the DM particles, ρ_DM is the DM energy density, and m_DM is the DM particle mass.\n\nFor DM decay, the energy injection rate per unit volume (Q) can be expressed as:\n\nQ = Γ_DMρ_DM\n\nwhere Γ_DM is the decay rate of the DM particles.\n\n2. Ionization history and CMB distortions:\nThe energy injected by DM annihilation or decay can ionize the hydrogen and helium atoms in the early universe, altering the ionization history. This can be described by the ionization fraction (x_e) as a function of redshift (z):\n\nx_e(z) = x_e,0(z) + Δx_e(z)\n\nwhere x_e,0(z) is the ionization fraction without DM annihilation or decay, and Δx_e(z) is the additional ionization fraction due to DM annihilation or decay.\n\nThe additional ionization fraction can be calculated by solving the recombination equations, considering the energy injection rate (Q) and the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom (E_ion):\n\nΔx_e(z) = Q(z) / (E_ion n_H(z))\n\nwhere n_H(z) is the number density of hydrogen atoms at redshift z.\n\nThe altered ionization history affects the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies through the visibility function (g), which describes the probability of a photon last scattering at a given redshift:\n\ng(z) = -dτ/dz * exp(-τ(z))\n\nwhere τ(z) is the optical depth as a function of redshift. The optical depth is sensitive to the ionization fraction, so the changes in x_e(z) due to DM annihilation or decay will modify the visibility function and, consequently, the CMB anisotropies.\n\n3. Observations and constraints:\nCurrent CMB experiments, such as the Planck satellite, have measured the temperature and polarization anisotropies with high precision. By comparing the observed CMB power spectra with theoretical predictions that include the effects of DM annihilation or decay, we can place constraints on the DM properties, such as the annihilation cross-section ⟨σv⟩ and the decay rate Γ_DM.\n\nFor example, the Planck collaboration has derived the following upper limit on the DM annihilation cross-section:\n\n⟨σv⟩ < 3.0 × 10^(-28) cm^3/s (for m_DM = 100 GeV)\n\nThis constraint is derived by requiring that the additional ionization fraction due to DM annihilation does not exceed the level allowed by the CMB data.\n\nIn summary, the possibility of dark matter annihilation or decay can affect the observed spectrum of photons in the cosmic microwave background radiation by altering the ionization history of the universe. This, in turn, can distort the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. By comparing the observed CMB power spectra with theoretical predictions, we can place constraints on the properties of dark matter particles, such as their annihilation cross-section and decay rate."
