    "message_2": "The strong coupling constant, denoted as αs, is a measure of the strength of the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together within protons, neutrons, and other particles. Its value depends on the energy scale at which it is measured, and it decreases as the energy scale increases, a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom.\n\nIn 2018, the LHCb collaboration at CERN reported a measurement of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale (mZ ≈ 91.2 GeV). They determined the value of αs(mZ) to be 0.1181 ± 0.0011 (experimental) ± 0.0005 (theoretical). This result is consistent with the world average value of αs(mZ) = 0.1183 ± 0.0007, which is based on a combination of measurements from various experiments at different energy scales.\n\nThe strong coupling constant has been measured at various energy scales by different experiments, such as those at electron-positron colliders (LEP, SLC), hadron colliders (Tevatron, LHC), and deep inelastic scattering experiments (HERA). These measurements have been combined to provide a more precise determination of αs and its dependence on the energy scale, which is described by the renormalization group equation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n\nIn summary, the LHCb measurement of the strong coupling constant at the Z boson mass scale is consistent with previous measurements at different energy scales, and it contributes to our understanding of the strong nuclear force and the behavior of quarks and gluons in the framework of QCD."
