    "message_2": "The average daily dose of cosmic ray background radiation that a human is exposed to is approximately 0.1 microsieverts (µSv) per day, which is equivalent to 36.5 µSv per year. This value can vary depending on factors such as altitude, latitude, and solar activity. For example, people living at higher altitudes or closer to the poles are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation.\n\nProlonged exposure to cosmic radiation can have potential biological effects on the human body. Cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles, mainly protons and some heavier nuclei, which can penetrate and interact with living tissues. These interactions can cause ionization, leading to the production of free radicals and damage to cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids.\n\nThe potential biological effects of prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation include:\n\n1. Increased risk of cancer: Ionizing radiation is a known carcinogen, and prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation can increase the risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia and cancers of the lung, breast, and thyroid.\n\n2. Damage to the central nervous system: High-energy particles can cause damage to neurons and other cells in the brain, potentially leading to cognitive impairments, memory loss, and other neurological disorders.\n\n3. Effects on the cardiovascular system: Radiation exposure can cause damage to the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.\n\n4. Effects on the immune system: Prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation can suppress the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and other diseases.\n\n5. Genetic effects: Radiation-induced damage to DNA can lead to mutations, which can be passed on to future generations if they occur in reproductive cells.\n\nIt is important to note that the average daily dose of cosmic radiation is relatively low, and the risks associated with prolonged exposure are generally considered to be small compared to other sources of ionizing radiation, such as medical imaging procedures and natural background radiation from the Earth. However, the potential risks of cosmic radiation exposure become more significant for astronauts and frequent air travelers, who are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation due to their time spent at high altitudes."
