    "message_2": "The electromagnetic interaction strength between two charged particles can be calculated using Coulomb's law:\n\nF = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force between the two particles, k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles, and r is the distance between them.\n\nGiven that the uncertainties in the measurement of the charge and distance are both 1%, we can use the formula for the propagation of uncertainties to find the uncertainty in the force:\n\nΔF/F = sqrt((Δq1/q1)^2 + (Δq2/q2)^2 + (2 * Δr/r)^2)\n\nSince Δq1/q1 = Δq2/q2 = Δr/r = 0.01 (1% uncertainty), the formula becomes:\n\nΔF/F = sqrt((0.01)^2 + (0.01)^2 + (2 * 0.01)^2)\nΔF/F = sqrt(0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0.0004)\nΔF/F = sqrt(0.0006)\n\nNow, we can find the uncertainty in the force:\n\nΔF = F * sqrt(0.0006)\n\nSince we don't have the actual values of q1, q2, and r, we cannot calculate the exact value of ΔF. However, the relative uncertainty in the force (ΔF/F) can be used to estimate the uncertainty in the electromagnetic interaction strength for any specific case."
