    "message_2": "The interaction between lattice vibrations (phonons) and electrons plays a crucial role in the occurrence of superconductivity in materials at low temperatures. This phenomenon can be explained through the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, which is the most widely accepted theory for conventional superconductivity.\n\nAccording to the BCS theory, when a material is cooled down to very low temperatures, the attractive interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) becomes significant. This interaction causes the electrons to form pairs, known as Cooper pairs. These pairs of electrons can move through the lattice without any resistance, leading to the superconducting state.\n\nThe process can be described in more detail as follows:\n\n1. An electron moving through the lattice causes a distortion in the lattice structure due to its negative charge. This distortion attracts the positively charged ions in the lattice, creating a region of higher positive charge density.\n\n2. This region of higher positive charge density attracts another electron, which forms a weakly bound pair with the first electron. This pairing is mediated by the lattice vibrations (phonons).\n\n3. The Cooper pairs formed in this manner have a lower energy state than individual electrons. This means that they can move through the lattice without scattering off impurities or lattice defects, which would normally cause resistance.\n\n4. At low temperatures, the thermal energy is not sufficient to break these Cooper pairs, allowing them to move freely through the material. This results in the superconducting state, where the material exhibits zero electrical resistance.\n\nIt is important to note that this explanation is applicable to conventional superconductors, which are usually metallic elements or simple alloys. In unconventional superconductors, such as high-temperature superconductors, the exact mechanism of superconductivity is still not fully understood, and other interactions may play a role in the formation of Cooper pairs and the superconducting state."
