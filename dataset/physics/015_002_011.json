    "message_2": "To determine the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a neutron star merger, we can use the chirp mass formula, which is a function of the masses of the two merging objects. The chirp mass (M) is given by:\n\nM = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two neutron stars. In this case, both neutron stars have a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the sun (M_sun). So, m1 = m2 = 1.4 * M_sun.\n\nM = (1.4 * M_sun * 1.4 * M_sun)^(3/5) / (1.4 * M_sun + 1.4 * M_sun)^(1/5)\n\nM ≈ 1.22 * M_sun\n\nNow, we can use the chirp mass to estimate the frequency of gravitational waves during the inspiral phase of the merger. The frequency (f) is given by:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (5 / 8π) * (M / t)^(3/8)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and t is the time until the merger. The time until the merger is difficult to determine without more information, but we can estimate the peak frequency (f_peak) during the merger using the following formula:\n\nf_peak ≈ 1.2 kHz * (M_sun / M)\n\nf_peak ≈ 1.2 kHz * (1 / 1.22)\n\nf_peak ≈ 0.98 kHz\n\nSo, the peak frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the neutron star merger is approximately 0.98 kHz. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual frequency may vary depending on the specific properties of the neutron stars and their orbit."
