    "message_1": "A rectangular loop of wire with sides 6 cm and 4 cm forms a plane that is parallel to the ground. The wire is carrying a current of 3 A. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point 8 cm above the center of the loop?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point above the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. However, due to the symmetry of the problem, we can simplify the calculation by considering only one side of the loop and then multiplying the result by 4 (since there are 4 sides).\n\nLet's consider one of the 6 cm sides. The distance from the center of this side to the point above the loop is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 3 cm (half of 6 cm) and 8 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find this distance:\n\nr = sqrt((3 cm)^2 + (8 cm)^2) = sqrt(9 + 64) = sqrt(73) cm\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field due to this side:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (3 A), dl is the length of the wire segment (6 cm), and r is the distance from the wire to the point (sqrt(73) cm).\n\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A * 6 cm) / (4 * π * (sqrt(73) cm)^2)\ndB = (10^(-7) Tm * 18 cm) / (73 cm^2)\ndB = 18 × 10^(-7) T / 73\ndB = 2.47 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSince there are 4 sides in the rectangular loop, the total magnetic field at the point above the center is:\n\nB = 4 * dB = 4 * 2.47 × 10^(-7) T = 9.88 × 10^(-7) T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. For each side of the loop, the magnetic field will be pointing in a direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the wire and the line connecting the wire to the point above the loop. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the magnetic field contributions from the opposite sides will cancel each other out in the horizontal direction, leaving only the vertical component. Since the current is flowing clockwise, the vertical component of the magnetic field will be pointing downward.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 8 cm above the center of the loop is 9.88 × 10^(-7) T, and its direction is downward."
