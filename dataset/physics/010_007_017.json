The density of the rock is 2500 kg/m^3 and the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. (Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2)",
    "message_2": "To find the buoyant force acting on the rock, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged object. \n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the rock. We can use the formula:\n\nVolume = mass / density\n\nVolume of rock = (500 kg) / (2500 kg/m^3) = 0.2 m^3\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the water displaced by the rock. Since the rock is fully submerged, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the rock.\n\nMass of displaced water = volume of displaced water * density of water\nMass of displaced water = (0.2 m^3) * (1000 kg/m^3) = 200 kg\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the displaced water, which is equal to the buoyant force acting on the rock.\n\nBuoyant force = weight of displaced water = mass of displaced water * acceleration due to gravity\nBuoyant force = (200 kg) * (9.81 m/s^2) = 1962 N\n\nNow, we need to compare the buoyant force with the weight of the rock to determine if it will sink or float.\n\nWeight of the rock = mass of the rock * acceleration due to gravity\nWeight of the rock = (500 kg) * (9.81 m/s^2) = 4905 N\n\nSince the buoyant force (1962 N) is less than the weight of the rock (4905 N), the rock will sink in water."
