    "message_2": "The presence of a black hole can affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in its vicinity in several ways. The most significant effects are gravitational lensing and redshifting.\n\n1. Gravitational lensing: A black hole's strong gravitational field can bend the path of light, including the CMB radiation. This bending of light is known as gravitational lensing. When CMB radiation passes close to a black hole, its path is deflected, causing the CMB photons to follow a curved trajectory. This can lead to a distortion in the observed CMB temperature and polarization patterns. In some cases, it can also create multiple images of the same CMB region, which can be observed as an increase in the CMB anisotropy.\n\n2. Redshifting: As CMB radiation approaches a black hole, it experiences a gravitational redshift due to the black hole's strong gravity. This means that the CMB photons lose energy and their wavelengths become longer (i.e., they are redshifted). This effect can cause a decrease in the observed temperature of the CMB radiation near a black hole.\n\nThese effects on the CMB spectra can be measured using high-resolution observations of the CMB temperature and polarization patterns. By analyzing these patterns, scientists can infer the presence of a black hole and study its properties, such as its mass and distance. However, it is important to note that these effects are generally small and challenging to detect, especially for isolated black holes. They become more significant in the presence of massive black holes or black hole clusters, where the combined gravitational effects are stronger."
