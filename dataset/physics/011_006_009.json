    "message_2": "The conductivity of a monolayer graphene sheet at room temperature is typically around 10^4 to 10^5 S/m (Siemens per meter). Graphene is a two-dimensional material with a honeycomb lattice structure, and its high conductivity is due to the unique electronic properties of its carbon atoms.\n\nThe conductivity of graphene can be altered by doping, which involves adding impurities or other elements to the graphene lattice. Doping can either increase or decrease the conductivity of graphene, depending on the type of dopant used and its concentration.\n\nWhen graphene is doped with electron-donating elements (n-type doping), the conductivity generally increases. This is because the dopant atoms donate electrons to the graphene lattice, increasing the number of charge carriers available for conduction. Examples of n-type dopants include alkali metals like potassium and cesium.\n\nOn the other hand, when graphene is doped with electron-accepting elements (p-type doping), the conductivity generally decreases. This is because the dopant atoms accept electrons from the graphene lattice, reducing the number of charge carriers available for conduction. Examples of p-type dopants include electron-deficient elements like boron and nitrogen.\n\nThe relationship between doping concentration and conductivity is not always linear, and it can be influenced by factors such as the type of dopant, the quality of the graphene lattice, and the presence of defects or impurities. However, in general, increasing the doping concentration will lead to a more pronounced change in the conductivity of the graphene sheet."
