    "message_1": "A spaceship is traveling towards Earth at a speed of 0.8c (where c is the speed of light). Another spaceship is traveling in the opposite direction toward the first spaceship at a speed of 0.6c. What is the relative velocity of the second spaceship as seen from the first spaceship? Use the formula for relativistic velocity addition to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the relative velocity of the second spaceship as seen from the first spaceship, we can use the formula for relativistic velocity addition. The formula is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nwhere v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, v1 = 0.8c and v2 = -0.6c (negative because it's in the opposite direction).\n\nv_rel = (0.8c - 0.6c) / (1 + (0.8c * -0.6c) / c^2)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / (1 - 0.48)\n\nv_rel = (0.2c) / 0.52\n\nv_rel â‰ˆ 0.385c\n\nSo, the relative velocity of the second spaceship as seen from the first spaceship is approximately 0.385c."
