    "message_2": "To determine the position and size of the image formed by the lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given by:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens.\n\nGiven, the focal length (f) is 10 cm and the object distance (u) is 20 cm. Plugging these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/v - 1/20\n\nTo solve for v, we can first find the common denominator:\n\n2/20 = (1/v - 1/20)\n\nNow, we can add 1/20 to both sides:\n\n(2 + 1)/20 = 1/v\n\n3/20 = 1/v\n\nNow, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nv = 20/3\n\nv = 6.67 cm (approximately)\n\nSo, the image is formed at a distance of 6.67 cm from the lens.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the image using the magnification formula:\n\nMagnification (m) = -v/u\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nm = -6.67/20\n\nm = -1/3\n\nThe magnification is -1/3, which means the image is 1/3 the size of the object and inverted (since the magnification is negative).\n\nSo, the image formed by the lens is at a distance of 6.67 cm from the lens, and it is 1/3 the size of the object and inverted."
