    "message_1": "A coaxial cable with an outer radius of 10 mm and an inner radius of 5 mm has a current of 2 A flowing through it. Find the magnetic field at a distance of 15 mm from the center of the cable. Assume the cable has an infinite length and the current is uniformly distributed.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 15 mm from the center of the cable, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current enclosed by the loop (I).\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nFor a coaxial cable, we can choose a circular Amperian loop with a radius r (15 mm in this case) centered at the center of the cable. The magnetic field will be tangential to the loop, and its magnitude will be constant along the loop. Therefore, the line integral simplifies to:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\n\nWe need to find the enclosed current (I_enclosed) within the Amperian loop. Since the current is uniformly distributed, we can find the current density (J) in the cable:\n\nJ = I / A\n\nwhere I is the total current (2 A) and A is the cross-sectional area of the cable. The cross-sectional area of the cable can be found by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle:\n\nA = π(R_outer^2 - R_inner^2) = π(10^2 - 5^2) = 75π mm²\n\nNow we can find the current density:\n\nJ = 2 A / 75π mm² ≈ 0.00849 A/mm²\n\nSince the Amperian loop is outside the cable (r = 15 mm > R_outer = 10 mm), the enclosed current is equal to the total current in the cable:\n\nI_enclosed = 2 A\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I_enclosed\nB = (μ₀I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A) / (2π * 15 mm)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / (30π mm)\n\nThe magnetic field B is:\n\nB ≈ 2.67 × 10^(-8) T"
