    "message_2": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, we can use Wien's Law, which relates the temperature of a blackbody to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation. Wien's Law is given by:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere λ_max is the wavelength at which the radiation peaks, T is the temperature of the blackbody, and b is Wien's constant, which is approximately 2.898 x 10^(-3) m*K.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength corresponding to the given frequency. The relationship between frequency (ν) and wavelength (λ) is given by:\n\nν = c / λ\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. We can rearrange this equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = c / ν\n\nPlugging in the given frequency of 160.2 GHz (1 GHz = 10^9 Hz):\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (160.2 x 10^9 Hz) ≈ 1.872 x 10^(-3) m\n\nNow that we have the wavelength at which the CMB radiation peaks, we can use Wien's Law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / λ_max\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^(-3) m*K) / (1.872 x 10^(-3) m) ≈ 1.547 K\n\nSo, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.547 Kelvin.\n\nThe corresponding wavelength of this peak is 1.872 x 10^(-3) meters, or 1.872 millimeters."
