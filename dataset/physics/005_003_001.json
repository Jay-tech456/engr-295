    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth, we will use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the combined velocity, v1 is the velocity of the first spaceship relative to Earth, v2 is the velocity of the second spaceship relative to the first spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.8c. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv = (0.6c + 0.8c) / (1 + (0.6c * 0.8c / c^2))\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + (0.48c^2 / c^2))\n\nv = (1.4c) / (1 + 0.48)\n\nv = (1.4c) / 1.48\n\nv â‰ˆ 0.9459c\n\nSo the velocity of the second spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth is approximately 0.9459c."
