    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state (n=1) of a hydrogen atom and place it in the n=2 excited state, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, nf is the final energy level (n=2), and ni is the initial energy level (n=1).\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1) = -13.6 eV * (-3/4) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state and place it in the n=2 excited state is 10.2 eV.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency (ν) of the photon emitted in the process using the following formula:\n\nE = hν\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and ν is the frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules:\n\nE = 10.2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.634 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nν = E / h = (1.634 x 10^-18 J) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) = 2.466 x 10^15 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the photon emitted in the process is 2.466 x 10^15 Hz.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the wavelength (λ) of the photon using the following formula:\n\nc = λν\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency.\n\nλ = c / ν = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.466 x 10^15 Hz) = 1.217 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the photon emitted in the process is 1.217 x 10^-7 m or 121.7 nm."
