    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters away from the center of the coil on its axis, we can use the formula for the magnetic field due to a circular loop:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * N * R²) / (2 * (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, N is the number of turns, R is the radius of the coil, and x is the distance from the center of the coil along its axis.\n\nGiven the values:\nI = 2 A\nN = 100 turns\nR = 0.2 m\nx = 0.1 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * 100 * (0.2 m)²) / (2 * ((0.2 m)² + (0.1 m)²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) T * 100 * 0.04 m²) / (2 * (0.04 m² + 0.01 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (3.2π × 10^(-5) T) / (2 * (0.05 m²)^(3/2))\n\nB = (3.2π × 10^(-5) T) / (2 * 0.01118034 m³)\n\nB = (3.2π × 10^(-5) T) / 0.02236068 m³\n\nB ≈ 0.00004504 T\n\nThe magnetic field at a point located 0.1 meters away from the center of the coil on its axis is approximately 0.00004504 Tesla."
