    "message_2": "To calculate the thickness of the boundary layer, we can use the Blasius solution for laminar boundary layers over a flat plate. The formula for the boundary layer thickness (δ) is given by:\n\nδ = (5 * x * (ν / V))^(1/2)\n\nwhere:\nx = distance along the flat plate (in this case, 2 meters)\nν = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (dynamic viscosity / density)\nV = free-stream velocity of the fluid (3 m/s)\n\nFirst, we need to find the kinematic viscosity (ν) of water:\n\nν = dynamic viscosity / density\nν = 0.001 Pa.s / 1000 kg/m³\nν = 1 x 10^(-6) m²/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the boundary layer thickness (δ) at the end of the flat plate (x = 2 meters):\n\nδ = (5 * 2 * (1 x 10^(-6) / 3))^(1/2)\nδ = (10 * (1/3) x 10^(-6))^(1/2)\nδ = (10/3 x 10^(-6))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ (3.33 x 10^(-6))^(1/2)\nδ ≈ 0.00182 meters\n\nSo, the thickness of the boundary layer at the end of the flat plate is approximately 0.00182 meters or 1.82 mm."
