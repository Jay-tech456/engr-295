    "message_2": "The maximum possible mass that a neutron star can have is determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit. The TOV limit is not a fixed value, as it depends on the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron star's matter, which describes the relationship between pressure, density, and temperature inside the star. However, the generally accepted range for the maximum mass of a neutron star is around 2 to 3 solar masses (1 solar mass = 1.989 x 10^30 kg).\n\nThe relationship between the mass of a neutron star and its radius is not straightforward, as it also depends on the EOS. However, a typical neutron star with a mass of around 1.4 solar masses (which is close to the average mass of observed neutron stars) has a radius of about 10-12 kilometers. As the mass of a neutron star increases, its radius tends to decrease due to the increased gravitational force compressing the star. This relationship is not linear, and the exact dependence of radius on mass again depends on the EOS.\n\nIn summary, the maximum mass of a neutron star is around 2 to 3 solar masses, and the relationship between mass and radius is complex and depends on the equation of state for the neutron star's matter."
