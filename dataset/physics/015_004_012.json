    "message_1": "What is the total energy released in the form of gravitational waves during a supernova explosion with a mass of 20 solar masses? Given that the duration of the explosion is 20 seconds and the average power emitted in gravitational waves during the event is 3.6 x 10^53 erg/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the total energy released in the form of gravitational waves during a supernova explosion, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal energy = Average power × Duration\n\nGiven the average power emitted in gravitational waves is 3.6 × 10^53 erg/s and the duration of the explosion is 20 seconds, we can calculate the total energy as follows:\n\nTotal energy = (3.6 × 10^53 erg/s) × (20 s)\n\nTotal energy = 72 × 10^53 erg\n\nSo, the total energy released in the form of gravitational waves during the supernova explosion is 72 × 10^53 erg."
