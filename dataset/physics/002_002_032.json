    "message_2": "To calculate the amount of heat transferred from the water to the copper block, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = mcΔT\n\nwhere Q is the heat transferred, m is the mass of the copper block, c is the specific heat capacity of copper, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nThe specific heat capacity of copper is 385 J/kg°C.\n\nFirst, let's convert the mass of the copper block from grams to kilograms:\n\n500 g = 0.5 kg\n\nNow, let's calculate the change in temperature:\n\nΔT = final temperature - initial temperature\nΔT = 75°C - 50°C\nΔT = 25°C\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nQ = (0.5 kg)(385 J/kg°C)(25°C)\n\nQ = 192.5 J/°C * 25°C\n\nQ = 4812.5 J\n\nTherefore, the amount of heat transferred from the water to the copper block during this time is 4812.5 Joules."
