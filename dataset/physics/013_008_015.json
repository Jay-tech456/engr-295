    "message_2": "To compare the energy released by gamma-ray bursts to the energy output of the Sun over its entire lifetime, we need to find the total energy output of the Sun and the average energy output of gamma-ray bursts.\n\nThe energy output of the Sun can be calculated using the equation:\n\nE_sun = L_sun * t_sun\n\nwhere E_sun is the total energy output of the Sun, L_sun is the solar luminosity (energy emitted per second), and t_sun is the Sun's lifetime.\n\nThe solar luminosity, L_sun, is approximately 3.8 x 10^26 watts (Joules per second). The Sun's lifetime is about 10 billion years (10^10 years), which we need to convert to seconds:\n\n1 year = 365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 3.15 x 10^7 seconds\n\nSo, the Sun's lifetime in seconds is:\n\nt_sun = 10^10 years * 3.15 x 10^7 seconds/year ≈ 3.15 x 10^17 seconds\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy output of the Sun:\n\nE_sun = L_sun * t_sun = (3.8 x 10^26 watts) * (3.15 x 10^17 seconds) ≈ 1.2 x 10^44 Joules\n\nNext, we need to find the average energy output of gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray bursts release a wide range of energies, but a typical value for the energy output is about 10^44 Joules.\n\nNow we can compare the energy released by a gamma-ray burst to the energy output of the Sun over its entire lifetime:\n\nE_gamma / E_sun = (10^44 Joules) / (1.2 x 10^44 Joules) ≈ 0.83\n\nThis means that the energy released by a typical gamma-ray burst is about 83% of the total energy output of the Sun over its entire lifetime. It's important to note that gamma-ray bursts release this energy in a very short time (seconds to minutes), while the Sun releases its energy over billions of years."
