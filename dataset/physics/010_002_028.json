    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of continuity, which states that the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity of the fluid remains constant in an incompressible fluid flow.\n\nLet A1 and V1 be the area and velocity of the water in the 20 cm diameter pipeline, and A2 and V2 be the area and velocity of the water in the 10 cm diameter pipeline.\n\nA1 = π(D1/2)^2 = π(20 cm/2)^2 = π(10 cm)^2 = 100π cm²\nV1 = 3 m/s = 300 cm/s (converted to cm/s for consistency)\n\nA2 = π(D2/2)^2 = π(10 cm/2)^2 = π(5 cm)^2 = 25π cm²\n\nAccording to the principle of continuity, A1V1 = A2V2.\n\n100π cm² * 300 cm/s = 25π cm² * V2\n\nSolving for V2:\n\nV2 = (100π cm² * 300 cm/s) / (25π cm²) = 1200 cm/s\n\nConverting back to meters per second:\n\nV2 = 1200 cm/s * (1 m/100 cm) = 12 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the water at the point where the pipeline narrows down is 12 m/s."
