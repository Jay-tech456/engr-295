    "message_2": "The current rate of expansion of the universe is described by the Hubble constant (H0). The most recent measurements from the Planck satellite mission estimate the Hubble constant to be approximately 67.4 km/s/Mpc (kilometers per second per megaparsec).\n\nDark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. According to the ΛCDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) model, which is the standard model of cosmology, dark energy accounts for about 68.3% of the total energy density of the universe.\n\nTo calculate the average density of dark energy, we can use the critical density of the universe (ρc) and the dark energy density parameter (ΩΛ). The critical density is given by the formula:\n\nρc = (3 * H0^2) / (8 * π * G)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Hubble constant to SI units (m/s/Mpc):\n\n67.4 km/s/Mpc * 1000 m/km * (1 Mpc / 3.086 × 10^19 m) ≈ 2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1\n\nNow we can calculate the critical density:\n\nρc ≈ (3 * (2.18 × 10^-18 s^-1)^2) / (8 * π * 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) ≈ 8.62 × 10^-27 kg/m^3\n\nFinally, we can find the average density of dark energy by multiplying the critical density by the dark energy density parameter:\n\nρΛ = ρc * ΩΛ ≈ 8.62 × 10^-27 kg/m^3 * 0.683 ≈ 5.89 × 10^-27 kg/m^3\n\nSo, the average density of dark energy in the universe, assuming a flat (Euclidean) geometry, is approximately 5.89 × 10^-27 kg/m^3."
