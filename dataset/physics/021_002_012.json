    "message_2": "The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the event horizon is a sphere, and its size can be determined by the Schwarzschild radius (Rs). The Schwarzschild radius is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 10 times the mass of the Sun (M = 10 × Msun), where the mass of the Sun (Msun) is approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 × (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (10 × 1.989 × 10^30 kg) / (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)^2\nRs ≈ 2.95 × 10^4 m\n\nSo, the event horizon of a black hole with a mass 10 times that of the Sun is a sphere with a radius of approximately 29.5 kilometers.\n\nAs the mass of the black hole increases, the size of the event horizon also increases. The relationship between the mass and the Schwarzschild radius is linear, meaning that if the mass doubles, the radius of the event horizon will also double. The shape of the event horizon remains spherical for a non-rotating black hole, regardless of the mass.\n\nHowever, if the black hole is rotating (a Kerr black hole), the shape of the event horizon becomes more oblate, meaning it is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. The size and shape of the event horizon in this case depend on both the mass and the angular momentum (spin) of the black hole."
