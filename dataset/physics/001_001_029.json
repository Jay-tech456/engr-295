    "message_2": "The one-dimensional infinite square well problem is a classic problem in quantum mechanics. It consists of a particle of mass \"m\" confined to a one-dimensional box of length \"L\" with infinitely high potential walls at the boundaries (x=0 and x=L). Inside the box, the potential energy is zero.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the wave function (ψ(x)) and the energy levels (E) of the particle. We start by setting up the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSince the potential energy is zero inside the box, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n(d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = - (2mE / ħ^2) * ψ(x)\n\nLet k^2 = 2mE / ħ^2, then the equation becomes:\n\n(d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = -k^2 * ψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(L) = 0, we find that:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), we require sin(kL) = 0. This implies that:\n\nkL = n * π, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow we can express k in terms of n:\n\nk = n * π / L\n\nThe energy levels can be found by substituting k back into the expression for k^2:\n\nE_n = (ħ^2 * k^2) / (2m) = (ħ^2 * n^2 * π^2) / (2m * L^2)\n\nThe wave function, normalized, is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(n * π * x / L)\n\nIn summary, the quantum mechanical solution to the one-dimensional infinite square well problem consists of quantized energy levels given by:\n\nE_n = (ħ^2 * n^2 * π^2) / (2m * L^2)\n\nand corresponding normalized wave functions:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(n * π * x / L)\n\nwhere n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)."
