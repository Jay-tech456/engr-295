    "message_2": "The event horizon is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In the context of a black hole, it is the point of no return, where the gravitational pull becomes so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Mathematically, the event horizon is defined as the surface at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light.\n\nFor a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the event horizon is a sphere with a radius called the Schwarzschild radius (Rs), which can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn the vicinity of a black hole, the event horizon affects the behavior of particles in several ways:\n\n1. Gravitational attraction: As particles approach the event horizon, the gravitational force exerted by the black hole increases, causing the particles to accelerate towards the black hole.\n\n2. Gravitational time dilation: Due to the strong gravitational field near the event horizon, time appears to slow down for an observer close to the black hole compared to an observer far away. This effect is known as gravitational time dilation and is described by the theory of general relativity.\n\n3. Gravitational redshift: As light or other electromagnetic radiation emitted by particles near the event horizon travels away from the black hole, its wavelength is stretched, causing a shift towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This effect is known as gravitational redshift.\n\n4. Spaghettification: As particles get closer to the event horizon, the difference in gravitational force between the side of the particle closest to the black hole and the side farthest away becomes significant. This results in a stretching effect, known as spaghettification or the tidal force, which can tear objects apart.\n\n5. Particle-antiparticle pairs: Near the event horizon, the strong gravitational field can cause the spontaneous creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Occasionally, one of these particles may escape the black hole while the other falls in, resulting in a phenomenon called Hawking radiation, which causes the black hole to lose mass over time."
