    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier, we can use the formula for the transmission coefficient T, which is given by:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier, and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the barrier height from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J. So, the barrier height in joules is:\n\nV = 3.0 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 4.8 x 10^-19 J\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy (E) of the particle. We can use the formula:\n\nE = V\n\nNow, we can calculate the wave number K inside the barrier using the formula:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / h^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, V is the potential barrier height, E is the kinetic energy of the particle, and h is the reduced Planck's constant (h = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nK = sqrt(2 * (5.0 x 10^-27 kg) * (4.8 x 10^-19 J) / (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nK ≈ 1.384 x 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission coefficient T:\n\nT = e^(-2 * (1.384 x 10^10 m^-1) * (2.0 x 10^-9 m))\nT ≈ 1.24 x 10^-12\n\nSo, the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier is approximately 1.24 x 10^-12 or 0.000000000124%."
