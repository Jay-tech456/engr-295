    "message_2": "To determine the wave function and energy eigenvalues of a particle in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, we first need to write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the system. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nV(x) = (1/2) * k * x^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant. We can rewrite this in terms of the angular frequency ω as:\n\nV(x) = (1/2) * m * ω^2 * x^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n\n- (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nSubstituting the harmonic oscillator potential, we get:\n\n- (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + (1/2) * m * ω^2 * x^2 * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we use a dimensionless variable ξ = (mω / ħ)^(1/2) * x and rewrite the wave function as ψ(x) = u(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2). Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation and simplifying, we obtain the following differential equation for u(ξ):\n\n(d^2u / dξ^2) - 2ξ * (du / dξ) + (2 * (E / (ħω)) - 1) * u = 0\n\nThis is the Hermite differential equation, and its solutions are given by the Hermite polynomials H_n(ξ), where n is a non-negative integer. The wave function ψ(x) can now be written as:\n\nψ_n(x) = (1 / (2^n * n! * (mω / πħ)^(1/4))) * H_n(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues E_n are given by:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħω\n\nwhere n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..."
