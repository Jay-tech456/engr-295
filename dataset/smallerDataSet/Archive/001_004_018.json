    "message_2": "The energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n=1) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, n is the principal quantum number, and eV (electron volt) is the unit of energy.\n\nFor the ground state (n=1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / (1^2) = -13.6 eV\n\nSo, the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state is -13.6 eV.\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy when the hydrogen atom is excited to the n=2 energy level:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nThe energy of the hydrogen atom in the n=2 energy level is -3.4 eV.\n\nTo find the change in energy when the hydrogen atom is excited from the ground state to the n=2 energy level, we can subtract the initial energy (ground state) from the final energy (n=2):\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the hydrogen atom increases by 10.2 eV when it is excited from the ground state to the n=2 energy level."
