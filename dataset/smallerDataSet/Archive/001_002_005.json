    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the position of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) as 2.5 × 10^-24 kg m/s, we can solve for the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx):\n\nΔx ≥ ħ / (2 * Δp)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 2.5 × 10^-24 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (5 × 10^-24 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ 2.1091436 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 2.11 × 10^-11 meters."
