    "message_2": "First, let's find the zero-point energy of the system. The zero-point energy (E_0) of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * h_bar * ω\n\nwhere h_bar is the reduced Planck constant (h_bar = h / 2π, where h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and ω is the angular frequency of the motion. The angular frequency ω can be found using the spring constant (k) and the mass (m) of the particle:\n\nω = sqrt(k / m)\n\nNow, let's find the angular frequency:\n\nω = sqrt(50 N/m / 0.1 kg) = sqrt(500 s^-2) = 10π rad/s\n\nNow we can find the zero-point energy:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * (h / 2π) * 10π = (1/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * 10 = 3.313 x 10^-33 J\n\nSince the potential energy of the system is equal to 2 times the zero-point energy, the total energy (E) of the system is:\n\nE = 2 * E_0 = 2 * 3.313 x 10^-33 J = 6.626 x 10^-33 J\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude (A) of the motion. The potential energy (U) of a harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nU = (1/2) * k * A^2\n\nAt the maximum displacement (amplitude), the potential energy is equal to the total energy of the system:\n\nE = (1/2) * k * A^2\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA^2 = (2 * E) / k\nA = sqrt((2 * 6.626 x 10^-33 J) / 50 N/m) = sqrt(2.652 x 10^-34 m^2) = 2.9 x 10^-17 m\n\nNow, let's find the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) of the particle in the first half period. At the maximum kinetic energy, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is equal to the kinetic energy:\n\nK_max = E = 6.626 x 10^-33 J\n\nFinally, we have the amplitude of the motion (A), the maximum kinetic energy (K_max), and the angular frequency (ω):\n\nAmplitude (A): 2.9 x 10^-17 m\nMaximum kinetic energy (K_max): 6.626 x 10^-33 J\nAngular frequency (ω): 10π rad/s"
