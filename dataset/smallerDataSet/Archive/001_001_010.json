    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2mE/ħ²)Ψ(x) = 0\n\nwhere Ψ(x) is the wave function, m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy level, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ Js).\n\nThe boundary conditions for an infinite potential well are:\n\nΨ(0) = 0\nΨ(L) = 0\n\nwhere L is the width of the well (0.3 nm in this case).\n\nThe general solution to the Schrödinger equation is:\n\nΨ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE/ħ²).\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nΨ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\n\nSo, the wave function simplifies to:\n\nΨ(x) = A sin(kx)\n\nNow, applying the second boundary condition:\n\nΨ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise, the wave function would be trivial), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis condition is satisfied when:\n\nkL = nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Thus, the allowed values of k are:\n\nk = nπ/L\n\nNow, we can find the energy levels E using the relation:\n\nE = ħ²k²/(2m)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. For simplicity, let's assume the particle is an electron. The mass of an electron is approximately 9.10938356 × 10⁻³¹ kg. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = (1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ Js)² * (nπ/0.3 × 10⁻⁹ m)² / (2 * 9.10938356 × 10⁻³¹ kg)\n\nE = 6.024 n² eV (approximately)\n\nThe energy levels are quantized and depend on the integer n. The wave function for each energy level is:\n\nΨ(x) = A sin(nπx/L)\n\nTo find the normalization constant A, we use the condition:\n\n∫[Ψ(x)]² dx = 1\n\nA² ∫[sin²(nπx/L)] dx = 1\n\nIntegrating sin²(nπx/L) from 0 to L and solving for A, we find:\n\nA = sqrt(2/L)\n\nSo, the normalized wave function is:\n\nΨ(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(nπx/L)\n\nIn summary, the energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width 0.3 nm are:\n\nE = 6.024 n² eV (approximately)\n\nand the corresponding wave functions are:\n\nΨ(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(nπx/L)"
