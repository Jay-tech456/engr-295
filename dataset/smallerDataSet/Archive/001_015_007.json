    "message_2": "Alice can use quantum teleportation protocol to transmit the state of an unknown qubit to Bob without physically sending the qubit by following these steps:\n\n1. Entanglement preparation: First, Alice and Bob need to share an entangled pair of qubits. This entangled pair is usually called a Bell pair. One common Bell pair is the maximally entangled state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2. Alice takes one qubit of the pair (qubit A) and Bob takes the other (qubit B).\n\n2. Alice prepares the unknown qubit: Alice has the unknown qubit (qubit C) that she wants to transmit to Bob. The state of this qubit can be represented as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex coefficients.\n\n3. Alice performs a Bell measurement: Alice now performs a joint Bell measurement on her qubits (qubit A and qubit C). This measurement will project the joint state of these two qubits onto one of the four Bell states: |Φ+⟩, |Φ-⟩, |Ψ+⟩, or |Ψ-⟩. The outcome of this measurement is a classical result (00, 01, 10, or 11) that Alice will need to send to Bob.\n\n4. Alice sends classical information to Bob: Alice sends the classical result of her Bell measurement to Bob through a classical communication channel. This is the only information that needs to be physically transmitted between Alice and Bob.\n\n5. Bob performs a unitary operation: Based on the classical information received from Alice, Bob performs a unitary operation on his qubit (qubit B) to transform it into the state of the unknown qubit (qubit C). The unitary operations are as follows:\n   - If Alice's result is 00, Bob does nothing (applies the identity operation).\n   - If Alice's result is 01, Bob applies the Pauli-X operation.\n   - If Alice's result is 10, Bob applies the Pauli-Z operation.\n   - If Alice's result is 11, Bob applies both the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operations.\n\n6. Bob obtains the unknown qubit: After performing the appropriate unitary operation, Bob's qubit (qubit B) is now in the same state as Alice's original unknown qubit (qubit C), |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.\n\nThe quantum teleportation protocol ensures that the transmitted state remains intact despite the interruption of the communication channel because the actual qubit is not transmitted. Instead, the protocol relies on entanglement and classical communication. The entangled pair of qubits allows for the correlation between Alice's and Bob's qubits, while the classical communication allows for the transfer of information needed to perform the correct unitary operation on Bob's qubit. This way, even if the classical communication channel is interrupted, the quantum state of the qubit is not affected. Once the classical information is successfully transmitted, Bob can perform the necessary operation to obtain the unknown qubit's state."
