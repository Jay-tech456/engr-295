    "message_2": "In quantum entanglement, the distance between two entangled particles does not have an impact on the degree of their non-local correlation. The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is independent of the spatial separation between the particles. This is because entangled particles share a common wave function, which describes their combined state. When a measurement is made on one of the entangled particles, the wave function collapses, and the state of the other particle is instantaneously determined, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nMathematically, this can be explained using the concept of entangled states. Consider two entangled particles A and B, with their combined state described by the wave function:\n\n|Ψ> = c1|ψ1>|φ1> + c2|ψ2>|φ2>\n\nHere, |ψ1> and |ψ2> are the possible states of particle A, and |φ1> and |φ2> are the possible states of particle B. The coefficients c1 and c2 are complex numbers that determine the probability amplitudes of the particles being in these states. The entangled state |Ψ> is a superposition of the product states |ψ1>|φ1> and |ψ2>|φ2>.\n\nWhen a measurement is made on particle A, the wave function collapses to either |ψ1> or |ψ2>, and the state of particle B is instantaneously determined as either |φ1> or |φ2>, respectively. This non-local correlation between the particles is independent of the distance between them, as the wave function |Ψ> describes their combined state without any reference to their spatial separation.\n\nReal-world examples of quantum entanglement can be found in experiments such as the famous Aspect experiment, which was conducted by Alain Aspect and his colleagues in 1982. In this experiment, entangled photon pairs were generated using a calcium cascade source and then sent to two separate detectors. The polarization of the photons was measured, and the results showed strong correlations between the polarization measurements of the entangled photon pairs, even when the detectors were placed several meters apart. This experiment provided strong evidence for the non-local nature of quantum entanglement and confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn summary, the distance between two entangled particles does not impact the degree of their non-local correlation in quantum entanglement. The phenomenon is independent of spatial separation, as the entangled particles share a common wave function that describes their combined state. This has been demonstrated experimentally in real-world examples such as the Aspect experiment."
