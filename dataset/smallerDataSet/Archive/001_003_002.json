    "message_2": "To find the probability that the particle will tunnel through the barrier, we can use the formula for the transmission probability T in quantum mechanics, which is given by:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, let's find the wave number K. The wave number inside the barrier is given by:\n\nK = √(2 * m * (V - E) / h^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, V is the potential barrier, E is the energy of the particle, and h is the reduced Planck constant (h = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js).\n\nThe energy difference (V - E) is:\n\nV - E = 7 eV - 20 eV = -13 eV\n\nSince we are dealing with eV, we need to convert it to Joules:\n\n-13 eV * (1.6 × 10^-19 J/eV) = -2.08 × 10^-18 J\n\nNow we can find the wave number K:\n\nK = √(2 * (1.5 × 10^-27 kg) * (-2.08 × 10^-18 J) / (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js)^2)\nK ≈ 1.364 × 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow we can find the transmission probability T:\n\nT = e^(-2 * (1.364 × 10^10 m^-1) * (5.0 × 10^-11 m))\nT ≈ e^(-13.64)\nT ≈ 1.18 × 10^-6\n\nSo the probability that the particle will tunnel through the barrier is approximately 1.18 × 10^-6 or 0.000118%."
