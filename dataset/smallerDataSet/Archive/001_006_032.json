    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the interference pattern of electrons on the screen can be described by the probability distribution function. The probability distribution function is given by the square of the amplitude of the wave function, which in turn is the sum of the wave functions of the electrons passing through each slit.\n\nThe interference pattern can be described by the following formula:\n\nI(x) = I0 * [cos^2(π * d * sin(θ) / λ)]\n\nwhere:\n- I(x) is the intensity of the interference pattern at position x on the screen\n- I0 is the maximum intensity\n- d is the distance between the slits (0.1 mm = 1e-4 m)\n- θ is the angle between the central maximum and the position x on the screen\n- λ is the wavelength of the electrons (0.1 nm = 1e-10 m)\n\nTo find the angle θ, we can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ x / L\n\nwhere:\n- x is the position on the screen\n- L is the distance between the slits and the screen (1 m)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the intensity formula in terms of x:\n\nI(x) = I0 * [cos^2(π * d * x / (λ * L))]\n\nThe probability distribution function is proportional to the intensity, so we can write:\n\nP(x) = K * [cos^2(π * d * x / (λ * L))]\n\nwhere K is a normalization constant. To find K, we need to ensure that the total probability is equal to 1:\n\n∫[P(x) dx] from -∞ to +∞ = 1\n\nHowever, solving for K analytically is quite challenging. In practice, the normalization constant can be determined numerically by calculating the integral of the probability distribution function over the range of interest and then dividing the function by the integral value.\n\nIn summary, the probability distribution of electrons in the double-slit experiment is given by:\n\nP(x) = K * [cos^2(π * d * x / (λ * L))]\n\nwith d = 1e-4 m, λ = 1e-10 m, and L = 1 m. The normalization constant K can be determined numerically."
