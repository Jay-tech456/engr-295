    "message_2": "The maximum distance two entangled particles can be separated and still exhibit non-local correlations is not limited by any fundamental physical law. However, in practice, the distance is limited by the efficiency of the entanglement generation process, the quality of the entangled particles, and the ability to maintain entanglement in the presence of environmental noise and losses.\n\nEntanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where the state of a composite quantum system cannot be described independently of the state of its constituents. This leads to correlations between the properties of the entangled particles, even when they are separated by large distances. The phenomenon of non-local correlations is a direct consequence of entanglement and is described by the famous Bell inequalities.\n\nBell inequalities are a set of mathematical inequalities that must be satisfied by any local hidden variable theory, which assumes that the properties of particles are predetermined and that no faster-than-light communication occurs between them. However, quantum mechanics predicts that entangled particles can violate these inequalities, exhibiting non-local correlations.\n\nSeveral experiments have been conducted to test the limits of non-locality in entangled systems, starting with the pioneering work of Alain Aspect and his colleagues in the early 1980s. They performed a series of experiments using entangled photons and demonstrated that the correlations between the photons' polarizations violated Bell inequalities, providing strong evidence for non-locality in quantum mechanics.\n\nMore recent experiments have pushed the limits of non-locality to even greater distances. In 2017, a team of Chinese researchers led by Jian-Wei Pan conducted an experiment using the Micius satellite, which was designed to generate and distribute entangled photon pairs. They successfully demonstrated entanglement between two ground stations separated by a record-breaking distance of 1,203 kilometers (about 747 miles), showing that non-local correlations can be maintained over vast distances.\n\nThe distance over which entangled particles can exhibit non-local correlations depends on several factors, such as the quality of the entangled particles, the efficiency of the entanglement generation process, and the ability to maintain entanglement in the presence of environmental noise and losses. As technology advances and our ability to generate and manipulate entangled particles improves, it is likely that we will continue to push the limits of non-locality in entangled systems.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no fundamental limit to the distance over which entangled particles can exhibit non-local correlations. However, practical limitations arise due to the efficiency of entanglement generation, the quality of the entangled particles, and the ability to maintain entanglement in the presence of environmental noise and losses. Experiments have demonstrated non-local correlations over distances of more than 1,000 kilometers, and future advancements in technology may allow us to push these limits even further."
