    "message_2": "The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle, such as an electron, is exposed to a magnetic field, even if the particle's trajectory does not pass through the region where the magnetic field is non-zero. The AB phase is the phase difference that the particle's wave function acquires due to the presence of the magnetic field.\n\nThe relationship between the Aharonov-Bohm phase (Φ_AB) and the magnetic flux (Φ_B) through a thin tube in the presence of a uniform magnetic field can be described by the following equation:\n\nΦ_AB = (e / ħ) * Φ_B\n\nHere, e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), and Φ_B is the magnetic flux through the thin tube, which can be calculated as the product of the magnetic field strength (B), the area enclosed by the tube (A), and the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the area (θ):\n\nΦ_B = B * A * cos(θ)\n\nThe Aharonov-Bohm phase is a dimensionless quantity, and it is significant when it is an integer multiple of 2π. In such cases, the charged particle experiences a measurable interference effect due to the presence of the magnetic field, even if it does not directly interact with the field. This phenomenon highlights the importance of the vector potential in quantum mechanics and demonstrates the non-local nature of quantum interactions."
