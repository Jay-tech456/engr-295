    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its second excited state, we need to find the difference in energy between the second excited state (n=3) and the ionized state (n=∞).\n\nThe energy of a hydrogen atom in a given energy level (n) is given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nWhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the second excited state (n=3):\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nFor the ionized state (n=∞), the energy is 0 eV, as the electron is no longer bound to the nucleus.\n\nThe energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom in its second excited state is the difference between the energies of the two states:\n\nΔE = E_∞ - E_3 = 0 eV - (-1.51 eV) = 1.51 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its second excited state is approximately 1.51 electron volts (eV)."
