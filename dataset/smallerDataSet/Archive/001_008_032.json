    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic moment of an electron with a spin of -1/2 in a magnetic field of 2 T, we need to use the formula for the magnetic moment of an electron:\n\nμ = -g * μ_B * S\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment, g is the electron g-factor (approximately 2 for an electron), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T), and S is the spin quantum number (-1/2 for this problem).\n\nμ = -2 * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T) * (-1/2)\n\nμ = 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic moment is 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic moment is opposite to the direction of the electron's spin. Since the electron has a spin of -1/2, the magnetic moment will be in the positive direction (opposite to the negative spin)."
