    "message_2": "The energy difference between the ground state (n=1) and the first excited state (n=2) of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the Rydberg formula for energy levels:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the ground state (n=1):\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the first excited state (n=2):\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nFinally, let's find the energy difference between the two states:\n\nÎ”E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of a hydrogen atom is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
