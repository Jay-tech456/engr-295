    "message_2": "Wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle are two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics that are closely related.\n\nWave-particle duality refers to the idea that particles, such as electrons and photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on the situation. This concept was first introduced by Louis de Broglie, who suggested that particles have an associated wavelength, called the de Broglie wavelength, given by Î» = h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the particle's momentum. This means that particles can exhibit interference and diffraction patterns, just like waves.\n\nThe uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. The most well-known example is the position and momentum of a particle. Mathematically, the uncertainty principle is given by"
