    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n1 = 1) to the first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n2:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-3/4)\n\nΔE = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state to the first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
