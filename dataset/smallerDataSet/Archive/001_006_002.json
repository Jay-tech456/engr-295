    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, light passes through two slits and creates an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits. This interference pattern is a result of the superposition of light waves from the two slits, which can either constructively or destructively interfere with each other, depending on their phase difference.\n\nWhen the distance between the two slits is changed, it affects the interference pattern in the following ways:\n\n1. Fringe spacing: The spacing between the bright and dark fringes (bands) in the interference pattern is directly related to the distance between the slits. As the distance between the slits increases, the fringe spacing decreases, making the fringes closer together. Conversely, as the distance between the slits decreases, the fringe spacing increases, making the fringes farther apart. Mathematically, the fringe spacing (w) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   w = λL / d\n\n   where λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance between the slits and the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\n2. Angular separation: The angular separation between the fringes is also affected by the distance between the slits. As the distance between the slits increases, the angular separation between the fringes decreases, making the fringes appear closer together when viewed at an angle. Conversely, as the distance between the slits decreases, the angular separation between the fringes increases, making the fringes appear farther apart when viewed at an angle. The angular separation (θ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   θ = λ / d\n\n   where λ is the wavelength of the light and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nIn summary, changing the distance between the two slits in the double-slit experiment affects the interference pattern by altering the fringe spacing and angular separation between the bright and dark bands. Increasing the distance between the slits results in closer fringes, while decreasing the distance results in more widely spaced fringes."
