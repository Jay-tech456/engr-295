    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding an electron in a spin-up state after it passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus oriented at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the z-axis, we need to use the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nLet's consider the initial state of the electron to be in the spin-up state along the z-axis, represented by the ket vector |+z⟩. The Stern-Gerlach apparatus is oriented at an angle of 30 degrees (θ = 30°) with respect to the z-axis, so we need to find the probability of finding the electron in the spin-up state along the new axis, which we'll call the n-axis.\n\nTo do this, we first need to express the spin-up state along the n-axis in terms of the spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. We can use the rotation operator to achieve this:\n\n|+n⟩ = cos(θ/2)|+z⟩ + sin(θ/2)|-z⟩\n\nPlugging in the angle θ = 30°:\n\n|+n⟩ = cos(15°)|+z⟩ + sin(15°)|-z⟩\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of finding the electron in the spin-up state along the n-axis, given that it was initially in the spin-up state along the z-axis. We can do this by taking the inner product of the initial state |+z⟩ with the final state |+n⟩:\n\nP(+n|+z) = |⟨+z|+n⟩|^2\n\nP(+n|+z) = |cos(15°)⟨+z|+z⟩ + sin(15°)⟨+z|-z⟩|^2\n\nSince ⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1 and ⟨+z|-z⟩ = 0, we have:\n\nP(+n|+z) = |cos(15°)|^2\n\nP(+n|+z) = (cos(15°))^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(+n|+z) ≈ (cos(15°))^2 ≈ (0.9659)^2 ≈ 0.933\n\nSo, the probability of finding the electron in a spin-up state after it passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus oriented at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the z-axis is approximately 0.933 or 93.3%."
