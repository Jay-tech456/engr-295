    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box with infinite potential walls. The potential energy function V(x) is given by:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ L\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n-ħ² / (2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nSince V(x) = 0 inside the box, the equation simplifies to:\n\n-ħ² / (2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = √(2mE) / ħ.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0, we get:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise, the wave function would be trivial), we must have sin(kL) = 0, which implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, the quantized wave number k_n and energy E_n are given by:\n\nk_n = nπ / L\nE_n = (ħ² * k_n²) / (2m) = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2m * L²)\n\nThe wave functions for the first three energy states (n = 1, 2, 3) are:\n\nψ_1(x) = A_1 * sin(πx / L)\nψ_2(x) = A_2 * sin(2πx / L)\nψ_3(x) = A_3 * sin(3πx / L)\n\nTo normalize the wave functions, we need to find the constants A_1, A_2, and A_3. The normalization condition is:\n\n∫ |ψ_n(x)|² dx = 1\n\nFor ψ_1(x), we have:\n\n∫ |A_1 * sin(πx / L)|² dx = 1\nA_1² * ∫ sin²(πx / L) dx = 1\n\nIntegrating from 0 to L and solving for A_1, we get:\n\nA_1 = √(2 / L)\n\nSimilarly, for ψ_2(x) and ψ_3(x), we get:\n\nA_2 = A_3 = √(2 / L)\n\nSo, the normalized wave functions are:\n\nψ_1(x) = √(2 / L) * sin(πx / L)\nψ_2(x) = √(2 / L) * sin(2πx / L)\nψ_3(x) = √(2 / L) * sin(3πx / L)\n\nFinally, the probability density function |ψ_n(x)|² gives the probability of finding the electron at a given position x within the box for each energy state:\n\nP_1(x) = |ψ_1(x)|² = (2 / L) * sin²(πx / L)\nP_2(x) = |ψ_2(x)|² = (2 / L) * sin²(2πx / L)\nP_3(x) = |ψ_3(x)|² = (2 / L) * sin²(3πx / L)"
