What is the probability that the particle will be found within a distance of 2a from the equilibrium position, where a = sqrt(hbar / (momega)).",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the particle being within a distance of 2a from the equilibrium position, we need to integrate the probability density function of the ground state wave function over the given range.\n\nThe ground state wave function for a quantum harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nψ(x) = (1/(a*sqrt(pi))) * exp(-x^2/(2a^2))\n\nwhere x is the position, a is the characteristic length scale (a = sqrt(hbar / (mω))), and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator (ω = sqrt(k/m)).\n\nThe probability density function is the square of the wave function:\n\nP(x) = |ψ(x)|^2 = (1/(a*pi)) * exp(-x^2/a^2)\n\nNow we need to integrate P(x) over the range -a to a:\n\nP(-a < x < a) = ∫[P(x) dx] from -a to a\n\nP(-a < x < a) = ∫[(1/(a*pi)) * exp(-x^2/a^2) dx] from -a to a\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the error function (erf):\n\nerf(z) = (2/sqrt(pi)) * ∫[exp(-t^2) dt] from 0 to z\n\nLet's make a substitution: t = x/a. Then dt = dx/a, and x = at.\n\nP(-a < x < a) = (1/pi) * ∫[exp(-t^2) dt] from -1 to 1\n\nNow we can use the error function:\n\nP(-a < x < a) = (1/pi) * [(pi/2) * (erf(1) - erf(-1))]\n\nP(-a < x < a) = (1/2) * (erf(1) - erf(-1))\n\nSince erf(-z) = -erf(z), we have:\n\nP(-a < x < a) = (1/2) * (erf(1) + erf(1))\n\nP(-a < x < a) = erf(1)\n\nNumerically, erf(1) ≈ 0.8427.\n\nSo the probability of finding the particle within a distance of 2a from the equilibrium position is approximately 0.8427 or 84.27%."
