    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier, we can use the transmission coefficient formula derived from quantum mechanics. For a one-dimensional potential barrier, the transmission coefficient (T) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wave number inside the barrier (K). The wave number can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, V is the potential barrier height, E is the energy of the particle, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / 2π, where h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nGiven values:\nm = 2.5 x 10^-27 kg\nV = 6.0 x 10^-19 J\nE = 4.5 x 10^-19 J\nhbar = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js\n\nNow, let's calculate K:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * (2.5 x 10^-27 kg) * (6.0 x 10^-19 J - 4.5 x 10^-19 J) / (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nK ≈ 1.35 x 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow that we have K, we can calculate the transmission coefficient (T):\n\nL = 1.0 nm = 1.0 x 10^-9 m\n\nT = e^(-2 * (1.35 x 10^10 m^-1) * (1.0 x 10^-9 m))\nT ≈ 1.52 x 10^-6\n\nSo, the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier is approximately 1.52 x 10^-6 or 0.000152%."
