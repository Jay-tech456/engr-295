    "message_2": "The probability of a pair of entangled particles being measured at the same spin state when separated by a distance of 10 km is determined by the nature of their entanglement. In the case of a maximally entangled pair of particles, such as those in a singlet state, the probability of measuring the same spin state is 0, while the probability of measuring opposite spin states is 1. This is because the entangled particles are perfectly correlated, and their spins are anti-correlated.\n\nThe probability of measuring the same or opposite spin states does not change as the distance between the particles increases. This is a key feature of entanglement, as the correlations between the particles persist regardless of the distance separating them. This phenomenon is known as non-locality in quantum mechanics.\n\nNon-locality demonstrates that the properties of entangled particles are not determined by local hidden variables, but rather by the entangled state itself. This means that the properties of one particle are instantaneously influenced by the measurement of the other particle, even if they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon has been experimentally verified through tests of Bell's inequalities, which show that the correlations between entangled particles cannot be explained by local hidden variables.\n\nIn summary, the probability of measuring the same spin state for a maximally entangled pair of particles is 0, and this probability does not change as the distance between the particles increases. This phenomenon demonstrates non-locality in quantum mechanics, as the properties of entangled particles are not determined by local hidden variables but by the entangled state itself."
