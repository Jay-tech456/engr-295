    "message_2": "To find the probability of measuring the spin of a silver atom in the +1/2 state, we need to find the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of the |+1/2⟩ state in the given wave function.\n\nThe wave function is given by:\n\nΨ = (1/2)(|+1/2⟩ + i√3/2|-1/2⟩)\n\nThe coefficient of the |+1/2⟩ state is 1/2. To find the probability, we take the square of the absolute value of this coefficient:\n\nProbability = |(1/2)|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the spin of a silver atom in the +1/2 state when passing through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus oriented along the z-axis is 1/4 or 0.25."
