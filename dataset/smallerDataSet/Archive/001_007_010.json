    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of the first three levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we need to use the energy formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state, 1 for the first excited state, etc.), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js), and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (8 N/m) and m is the oscillator mass (0.1 kg).\n\nω = √(8/0.1) = √80 ≈ 8.944\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy of the first three levels (n = 0, 1, 2) using the energy formula:\n\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2)ħω = (1/2)ħω\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω\nE_2 = (2 + 1/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for ħ and ω:\n\nE_0 = (1/2)(1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)(8.944) ≈ 4.717 × 10^(-34) J\nE_1 = (3/2)(1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)(8.944) ≈ 1.415 × 10^(-33) J\nE_2 = (5/2)(1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)(8.944) ≈ 2.358 × 10^(-33) J\n\nSo, the energy of the first three levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are approximately:\n\nE_0 ≈ 4.717 × 10^(-34) J\nE_1 ≈ 1.415 × 10^(-33) J\nE_2 ≈ 2.358 × 10^(-33) J"
