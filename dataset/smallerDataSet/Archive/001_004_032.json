    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the third and fifth energy levels of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the electron at the third energy level (n = 3):\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the electron at the fifth energy level (n = 5):\n\nE_5 = -13.6 eV / 5^2 = -13.6 eV / 25 ≈ -0.544 eV\n\nFinally, let's find the energy difference between the third and fifth energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_5 - E_3 = -0.544 eV - (-1.51 eV) ≈ 0.966 eV\n\nSo, the energy difference between the third and fifth energy levels of a hydrogen atom is approximately 0.966 eV."
