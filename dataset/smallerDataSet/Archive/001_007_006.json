    "message_2": "The energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10^-34 Js), ω is the angular frequency, and n is the energy level (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nFirst, let's find the ground state energy (n = 0):\n\nE_0 = (1/2)ħω\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the particle in the nth energy level:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω\n\nTo express the energy of the particle in terms of the ground state energy, we can divide E_n by E_0:\n\n(E_n / E_0) = [(n + 1/2)ħω] / [(1/2)ħω]\n\nThe ħω terms cancel out:\n\n(E_n / E_0) = (n + 1/2) / (1/2)\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n\n(E_n / E_0) = 2(n + 1/2)\n\nSo, the energy of the particle in the nth energy level is (2n + 1) times the ground state energy."
