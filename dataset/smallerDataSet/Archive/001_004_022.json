    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen electron from the ground state (n1 = 1) to the third excited state (n2 = 4), we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, n1 and n2 are the initial and final energy levels, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n2:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4^2 - 1/1^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/16 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-15/16)\n\nΔE ≈ 12.75 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen electron from the ground state to the third excited state is approximately 12.75 electron volts (eV)."
