    "message_2": "To teleport the quantum state of a third qubit to Bob using the quantum teleportation protocol, Alice and Bob must follow these steps:\n\n1. Entanglement creation: Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, usually called Bell pair. This pair can be represented as:\n(|00> + |11>)/√2\n\n2. Alice prepares the third qubit, which is the qubit she wants to teleport to Bob. Let's call this qubit's state |ψ>, which can be represented as:\n|ψ> = α|0> + β|1>\n\n3. Alice performs a joint measurement on her qubit from the entangled pair and the qubit she wants to teleport (|ψ>). This measurement is done in the Bell basis, which consists of the following four states:\n(|00> + |11>)/√2\n(|00> - |11>)/√2\n(|01> + |10>)/√2\n(|01> - |10>)/√2\n\n4. The joint measurement will yield one of the four possible outcomes, each corresponding to one of the Bell basis states. Alice records the result of this measurement (two classical bits of information) and sends this information to Bob through a classical communication channel.\n\n5. Bob receives the classical bits from Alice and performs a unitary operation on his qubit from the entangled pair, depending on the received information:\n\n- If Alice's measurement result is (00), Bob does nothing to his qubit.\n- If Alice's measurement result is (01), Bob applies the Pauli-X gate to his qubit.\n- If Alice's measurement result is (10), Bob applies the Pauli-Z gate to his qubit.\n- If Alice's measurement result is (11), Bob applies both Pauli-X and Pauli-Z gates to his qubit.\n\n6. After Bob performs the appropriate operation, his qubit will be in the state |ψ> = α|0> + β|1>, which is the same state as Alice's original qubit. The quantum state has been successfully teleported from Alice to Bob.\n\nIt's important to note that during this process, the original qubit's state |ψ> is destroyed at Alice's side due to the joint measurement, and no cloning of the quantum state occurs, which is consistent with the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics."
