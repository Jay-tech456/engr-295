    "message_2": "The Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that can correct a single qubit error in a quantum state represented by 7 qubits using only 4 qubits to encode the state. It is a CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code, which means it is constructed from two classical linear codes. The Steane code is based on the classical [7,4,3] Hamming code, which can correct a single bit error in a 7-bit word.\n\nTo construct the Steane code, we first need to find the parity check matrix H for the classical Hamming code. The Hamming code has the following generator matrix G:\n\nG = | 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 |\n    | 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 |\n    | 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 |\n    | 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 |\n\nThe parity check matrix H can be found by ensuring that G * H^T = 0. One possible H is:\n\nH = | 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 |\n    | 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 |\n    | 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 |\n\nNow, we can construct the Steane code by encoding the logical qubits |0> and |1> as follows:\n\n|0_L> = 1/sqrt(8) * (|0000000> + |1010101> + |0110011> + |1100110> + |0001111> + |1011010> + |0111100> + |1101001>)\n\n|1_L> = 1/sqrt(8) * (|1111111> + |0101010> + |1001100> + |0011001> + |1110000> + |0100101> + |1000011> + |0010110>)\n\nTo detect and correct errors, we need to perform a syndrome measurement using the parity check matrix H. The syndrome is a 3-bit binary number that indicates the position of the error in the 7-qubit state. The syndromes for the Steane code can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. No error: H * 0000000^T = 000\n2. Single qubit errors:\n   - H * 1000000^T = 110\n   - H * 0100000^T = 101\n   - H * 0010000^T = 011\n   - H * 0001000^T = 111\n   - H * 0000100^T = 100\n   - H * 0000010^T = 010\n   - H * 0000001^T = 001\n\nThe syndromes tell us which qubit is in error. To correct the error, we apply a Pauli-X gate to the qubit indicated by the syndrome. This will flip the qubit back to its correct state, effectively correcting the single qubit error in the 7-qubit quantum state."
