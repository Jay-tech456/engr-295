    "message_2": "The Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well can be written as:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, V(x) is the potential energy, and E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nFor an infinite potential well, the potential energy V(x) is defined as:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ L\n\nwhere L is the width of the well.\n\nInside the well (0 < x < L), the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = √(2mE/ħ²).\n\nApplying the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since the wave function must be zero at the boundary)\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\nkL = nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Thus, the allowed wave numbers are:\n\nk_n = nπ/L\n\nThe energy eigenvalues can be found by substituting k_n back into the expression for k:\n\nE_n = ħ²k_n²/(2m) = ħ²(nπ/L)²/(2m) = n²π²ħ²/(2mL²)\n\nSo, the energy eigenvalues are quantized and depend on the integer n.\n\nFinally, the normalized wave functions for the particle in the one-dimensional infinite potential well are:\n\nψ_n(x) = √(2/L) sin(nπx/L)\n\nThese wave functions and their corresponding energy eigenvalues describe the stationary states of the particle in the infinite potential well."
