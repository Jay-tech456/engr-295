    "message_2": "In quantum mechanics, entangled particles exhibit a strong correlation in their properties, such as spin, polarization, or momentum. The degree of correlation between two entangled particles is quantified by a value called the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.\n\nFor entangled particles, the correlation coefficient is typically close to 1 or -1, depending on the specific entanglement state. This strong correlation is a result of the particles being described by a single, shared wave function, which determines their properties.\n\nThe fascinating aspect of entangled particles is that this strong correlation persists even when the particles are separated by large distances. According to the principle of quantum nonlocality, the properties of entangled particles remain correlated regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon has been experimentally confirmed through tests of Bell inequalities, which show that the correlations between entangled particles cannot be explained by local hidden variables.\n\nIn summary, the degree of correlation between two entangled particles is typically close to 1 or -1, and this strong correlation persists even when the particles are separated by large distances. The correlation does not change based on the distance between the particles, as the entanglement is a nonlocal quantum phenomenon."
