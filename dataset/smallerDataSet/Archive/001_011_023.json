    "message_2": "In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we measure the spin of an electron along a specific axis, in this case, the z-axis. The electron's spin can be either +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down) along the z-axis. \n\nIf the electron's spin was prepared to be pointing along a direction that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the z-axis, we can use the following formula to calculate the probability of measuring the spin to be +1/2 along the z-axis:\n\nP(+1/2) = cos^2(θ/2)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the prepared spin direction and the z-axis.\n\nIn this case, θ = 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(+1/2) = cos^2(π/12) ≈ 0.8536\n\nSo, the probability of measuring the spin of the electron to be +1/2 along the z-axis is approximately 0.8536 or 85.36%."
