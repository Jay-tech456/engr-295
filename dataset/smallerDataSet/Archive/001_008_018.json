    "message_2": "For a spin-1/2 particle in an external magnetic field, the energy difference between the two possible spin states can be found using the Zeeman effect formula:\n\nΔE = g * μB * B\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, g is the g-factor (which is 2 for a spin-1/2 particle), μB is the Bohr magneton, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nGiven B = 1 T, we can calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE = 2 * μB * 1 T = 2μB\n\nThe energy difference between the two possible spin states is 2μB.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic moment of the particle. The magnetic moment (μ) is related to the angular momentum (L) and the g-factor by the following equation:\n\nμ = g * (e / 2m) * L\n\nFor a spin-1/2 particle, the angular momentum L = ħ * √(s * (s + 1)), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and s is the spin quantum number (s = 1/2 for a spin-1/2 particle).\n\nL = ħ * √((1/2) * (1/2 + 1)) = ħ * √(3/4)\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = 2 * (e / 2m) * ħ * √(3/4)\n\nSince the Bohr magneton μB = eħ / 2m, we can rewrite the magnetic moment in terms of μB:\n\nμ = 2 * μB * √(3/4) = √3 * μB\n\nThe magnetic moment of the spin-1/2 particle is √3 * μB."
