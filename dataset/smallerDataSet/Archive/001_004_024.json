    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen electron from the n=1 to the n=3 energy level, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels in a hydrogen atom:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = (-13.6 eV / n_final^2) - (-13.6 eV / n_initial^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E_final is the energy of the final level (n=3), E_initial is the energy of the initial level (n=1), and n is the principal quantum number of the energy level.\n\nPlugging in the values for n_initial and n_final:\n\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 3^2) - (-13.6 eV / 1^2)\nΔE = (-13.6 eV / 9) - (-13.6 eV)\nΔE = -1.51 eV + 13.6 eV\nΔE = 12.09 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen electron from the n=1 to the n=3 energy level is 12.09 eV."
