Suppose the system is initially in the ground state $\\psi_0(x)$ with energy $E_0$. Calculate the probability that at time $t$, the system will be found in the first excited state $\\psi_1(x)$ with energy $E_1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time-dependent wave function of the system and then calculate the probability of finding the system in the first excited state at time t.\n\nThe time-dependent wave function of a quantum system can be expressed as a linear combination of its energy eigenstates:\n\nΨ(x, t) = Σ c_n(t) * ψ_n(x)\n\nwhere c_n(t) are the time-dependent coefficients and ψ_n(x) are the energy eigenstates.\n\nSince the system is initially in the ground state, the coefficients at t = 0 are:\n\nc_0(0) = 1, c_n(0) = 0 for n ≠ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the time-dependent coefficients c_n(t). To do this, we use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:\n\niħ * (dΨ(x, t) / dt) = H * Ψ(x, t)\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and H is the Hamiltonian operator.\n\nApplying the Schrödinger equation to the linear combination of energy eigenstates, we get:\n\niħ * Σ (dc_n(t) / dt) * ψ_n(x) = Σ c_n(t) * H * ψ_n(x)\n\nSince the energy eigenstates form a complete set, we can multiply both sides by ψ_m(x) and integrate over x:\n\niħ * (dc_m(t) / dt) = c_m(t) * E_m\n\nNow, we can solve this first-order differential equation for c_m(t):\n\ndc_m(t) / dt = (-i / ħ) * E_m * c_m(t)\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nc_m(t) = c_m(0) * exp(-i * E_m * t / ħ)\n\nNow, we can find the time-dependent coefficients for the ground state (n = 0) and the first excited state (n = 1):\n\nc_0(t) = exp(-i * E_0 * t / ħ)\nc_1(t) = 0 * exp(-i * E_1 * t / ħ) = 0\n\nSince c_1(t) = 0, the probability of finding the system in the first excited state at any time t is:\n\nP(ψ_1, t) = |c_1(t)|^2 = 0\n\nSo, the probability that at time t, the system will be found in the first excited state is 0."
