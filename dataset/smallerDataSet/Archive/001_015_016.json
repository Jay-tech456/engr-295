    "message_2": "In the Quantum Teleportation Protocol, the goal is to transfer the state of a qubit from a sender (Alice) to a receiver (Bob) using an entangled pair of qubits shared between them. Let's denote the initial state of Alice's qubit as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex coefficients such that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.\n\nThe channel between Alice and Bob is in the Bell state |Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩). Let's denote Alice's half of the entangled pair as qubit A and Bob's half as qubit B. The initial state of the three qubits (Alice's qubit, qubit A, and qubit B) can be written as:\n\n|Ψ_initial⟩ = |ψ⟩ ⊗ |Φ+⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell basis measurement on her qubit and qubit A. The Bell basis states are:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n|Φ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ - |11⟩)\n|Ψ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ + |10⟩)\n|Ψ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ - |10⟩)\n\nThe state of the three qubits after Alice's measurement can be written as:\n\n|Ψ_after⟩ = (1/2)[(α|Φ+⟩ + β|Ψ+⟩) ⊗ |0⟩ + (α|Φ-⟩ + β|Ψ-⟩) ⊗ |1⟩]\n\nNow, Alice sends the result of her measurement (two classical bits) to Bob. Based on the received information, Bob applies one of the following operations to his qubit B:\n\n1. If Alice measured |Φ+⟩, Bob does nothing (applies the identity operation I).\n2. If Alice measured |Φ-⟩, Bob applies the Z gate (phase flip).\n3. If Alice measured |Ψ+⟩, Bob applies the X gate (bit flip).\n4. If Alice measured |Ψ-⟩, Bob applies the XZ gate (bit and phase flip).\n\nAfter Bob applies the appropriate operation, the state of his qubit B becomes:\n\n|Ψ_final⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nThis is the same as the initial state of Alice's qubit, so the teleportation is successful. Since the Quantum Teleportation Protocol is deterministic, the probability of successfully teleporting the state of a qubit from Alice to Bob using the channel in the Bell state |Φ+⟩ is 100% or 1."
