    "message_1": "What is the distance between two slits in the double-slit experiment if the interference pattern on a screen placed 1 meter away shows bright fringes spaced 2 millimeters apart and the wavelength of the light source is 500 nanometers?",
    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, the distance between bright fringes (y) on the screen can be calculated using the formula:\n\ny = (位 * L) / d\n\nwhere 位 is the wavelength of the light source, L is the distance between the screen and the slits, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\ny = 2 mm = 0.002 m (converting to meters)\n位 = 500 nm = 5 * 10^(-7) m (converting to meters)\nL = 1 m\n\nWe need to find the value of d. Rearranging the formula to solve for d, we get:\n\nd = (位 * L) / y\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nd = (5 * 10^(-7) m * 1 m) / 0.002 m\n\nd = 2.5 * 10^(-4) m\n\nSo, the distance between the two slits in the double-slit experiment is 2.5 * 10^(-4) meters or 250 micrometers."
