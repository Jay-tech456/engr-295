    "message_2": "To construct a quantum error correction code that can detect and correct a single qubit flip error, we can use the 9-qubit Shor code. The Shor code encodes a single logical qubit into 9 physical qubits and can correct for any single qubit error.\n\nLet's denote the logical qubit states as |0_L⟩ and |1_L⟩. The Shor code encodes these logical qubits as follows:\n\n|0_L⟩ = (|000⟩ + |111⟩)^⊗3 / 2√2\n|1_L⟩ = (|000⟩ - |111⟩)^⊗3 / 2√2\n\nwhere ⊗ denotes the tensor product. Now, let's encode the given 3-qubit state |ψ⟩ using the Shor code:\n\n|ψ⟩ = (|000⟩ + |111⟩) / √2\n|ψ_L⟩ = (|0_L⟩ + |1_L⟩) / √2\n\n|ψ_L⟩ = ( (|000⟩ + |111⟩)^⊗3 + (|000⟩ - |111⟩)^⊗3 ) / 4√2\n\nNow, suppose one of the qubits in this state is randomly flipped from 0 to 1 before measurement. To detect and correct this error, we can use the following procedure:\n\n1. Perform a syndrome measurement using ancilla qubits. This will give us information about the error without collapsing the state.\n\n2. Based on the syndrome measurement, apply the appropriate correction operation to the affected qubit. For a single qubit flip error, this will be the Pauli-X gate.\n\n3. Decode the corrected state back to the original 3-qubit state by applying the inverse of the Shor code encoding.\n\nThis quantum error correction code can detect and correct a single qubit flip error in the given 3-qubit state |ψ⟩."
