    "message_2": "Interference fringes can be used to calculate the wavelength of an unknown light source using the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics by following these steps:\n\n1. Set up the double-slit experiment: Shine the unknown light source through two closely spaced slits onto a screen. The light waves passing through the slits will interfere with each other, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen.\n\n2. Measure the distance between the slits (d) and the distance from the slits to the screen (L). These values should be known or can be measured using a ruler.\n\n3. Measure the distance between the central bright fringe (also known as the central maximum) and the first bright fringe on either side of it (y). This distance corresponds to the separation between adjacent bright fringes.\n\n4. Determine the order of the fringe: The first bright fringe on either side of the central maximum is considered the first-order fringe (m = 1). If you measure the distance to the second bright fringe, then m = 2, and so on.\n\n5. Use the double-slit interference formula to calculate the wavelength (λ) of the unknown light source:\n\nλ = (y * d) / (m * L)\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, y is the distance between the central maximum and the m-th order fringe, d is the distance between the slits, m is the order of the fringe, and L is the distance from the slits to the screen.\n\nBy using the interference fringe pattern and the double-slit interference formula, you can calculate the wavelength of an unknown light source in the context of quantum mechanics."
