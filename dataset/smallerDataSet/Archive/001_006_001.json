    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, light passes through two narrow slits and creates an interference pattern on a screen placed at some distance from the slits. The interference pattern consists of alternating bright and dark bands, which are the result of constructive and destructive interference of the light waves.\n\nThe relationship between the width of the slits (a), the distance between the slits (d), the distance of the interference pattern from the double-slit (L), and the wavelength of the light (λ) can be described by the formula for the angular position of the bright fringes (maxima) in the interference pattern:\n\nsin(θ) = m * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the central maximum and the m-th maximum, and m is an integer representing the order of the maximum (0 for central maximum, 1 for the first maximum, and so on).\n\nTo find the linear position of the m-th maximum (Y_m) on the screen, we can use the small-angle approximation:\n\nY_m = L * tan(θ) ≈ L * sin(θ)\n\nSubstituting the formula for sin(θ):\n\nY_m = L * m * (λ / d)\n\nThis equation shows the relationship between the width of the slits (d), the distance of the interference pattern from the double-slit (L), and the position of the maxima in the interference pattern (Y_m).\n\nThe double-slit experiment can indeed be explained by wave-particle duality. When light is treated as a wave, the interference pattern can be explained by the superposition of the waves coming from the two slits. When light is treated as particles (photons), the interference pattern can be explained by the probability distribution of the photons, which is determined by the quantum mechanical wave function of the photons. In both cases, the same relationship between the slit width, the distance of the interference pattern, and the position of the maxima holds true, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of light."
