    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δy) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2:\n\nΔy * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nFirst, we need to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The momentum (p) of an electron can be calculated using the formula:\n\np = m * v\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron (9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg) and v is its velocity (2.0 x 10^6 m/s).\n\nNow, we need to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). Since the uncertainty in velocity (Δv) is given as 7.0 x 10^5 m/s, we can calculate Δp using the same formula:\n\nΔp = m * Δv\n\nΔp = (9.10938356 x 10^-31 kg) * (7.0 x 10^5 m/s)\nΔp ≈ 6.376568 x 10^-25 kg m/s\n\nNow that we have the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in position (Δy):\n\nΔy * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for Δy:\n\nΔy ≥ ħ/(2 * Δp)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nΔy ≥ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 6.376568 x 10^-25 kg m/s)\nΔy ≥ 8.25 x 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position (y-direction) of the electron is approximately 8.25 x 10^-11 meters."
