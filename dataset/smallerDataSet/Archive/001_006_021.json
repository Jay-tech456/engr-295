    "message_2": "To find the maximum distance between adjacent bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern, we can use the formula:\n\nΔy = (λ * L) / d\n\nwhere Δy is the distance between adjacent bright fringes, λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nIn this case, we are given the distance between the slits (d = 0.1 mm = 1e-4 m) and the wavelength of the light (λ = 500 nm = 5e-7 m). However, we are not given the distance from the slits to the screen (L). \n\nTo find the maximum distance between adjacent bright fringes, we need to consider the largest possible value for L. In practice, this would depend on the specific experimental setup and the size of the screen used. However, without this information, we cannot provide an exact value for the maximum distance between adjacent bright fringes.\n\nIf you can provide the distance from the slits to the screen (L), we can calculate the maximum distance between adjacent bright fringes for your specific setup."
