    "message_2": "The Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box (also known as a particle in a finite potential well) is given by:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ/dx²) + V(x)ψ = Eψ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ is the wave function of the particle, V(x) is the potential energy function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nFor a one-dimensional box of length L, the potential energy function V(x) is defined as:\n\nV(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ L\n\nThis means that the particle is confined within the box and cannot escape it. To solve the Schrödinger equation for this system, we need to find the wave function ψ(x) and the energy E of the particle.\n\nSince V(x) = 0 inside the box, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ/dx²) = Eψ\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is given by:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = √(2mE/ħ²).\n\nApplying the boundary conditions ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0 (since the wave function must vanish at the walls of the box), we get:\n\nψ(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Thus, the allowed values of k are:\n\nk_n = nπ/L\n\nThe corresponding energy levels E_n can be found by substituting k_n back into the expression for k:\n\nE_n = (ħ²k_n²)/(2m) = (ħ²n²π²)/(2mL²)\n\nThe wave function for each energy level is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n sin(k_n x) = A_n sin((nπx)/L)\n\nwhere A_n is a normalization constant, which can be determined by requiring that the total probability of finding the particle in the box is equal to 1:\n\n∫[ψ_n(x)]² dx from 0 to L = 1\n\nSolving for A_n, we get:\n\nA_n = √(2/L)\n\nSo, the final solution for the wave function is:\n\nψ_n(x) = √(2/L) sin((nπx)/L)\n\nIn summary, the energy levels E_n of a particle in a one-dimensional box are quantized and depend on the size of the box as:\n\nE_n = (ħ²n²π²)/(2mL²)\n\nThe wave function ψ_n(x) for each energy level is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = √(2/L) sin((nπx)/L)"
