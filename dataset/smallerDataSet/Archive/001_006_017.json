    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, particles (such as photons or electrons) pass through two slits and create an interference pattern on a screen placed at some distance from the slits. The probability distribution of particles on the screen can be described by the intensity of the interference pattern.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the slits as d, the wavelength of the particles as λ, and the distance from the slits to the screen as L. We'll also use θ as the angle between the central maximum and the point on the screen where we want to find the probability distribution.\n\nThe path difference between the two slits for a particle reaching the screen at angle θ is given by:\n\nΔx = d * sin(θ)\n\nThe condition for constructive interference (bright fringes) is:\n\nΔx = m * λ, where m is an integer (0, ±1, ±2, ...)\n\nThe condition for destructive interference (dark fringes) is:\n\nΔx = (m + 1/2) * λ, where m is an integer\n\nNow, we can find the intensity I(θ) of the interference pattern, which is proportional to the probability distribution of particles on the screen. The intensity is given by:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ * [cos^2(π * d * sin(θ) / λ)]\n\nwhere I₀ is the maximum intensity at the central maximum (θ = 0).\n\nIn summary, the probability distribution of particles passing through a double-slit experiment can be described by the intensity I(θ) of the interference pattern on the screen, which depends on the distance between the slits (d), the wavelength of the particles (λ), and the angle θ between the central maximum and the point on the screen where we want to find the probability distribution."
