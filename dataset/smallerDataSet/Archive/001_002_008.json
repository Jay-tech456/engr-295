    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in position and momentum of an electron confined within a region of size 100 nm, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant (ħ):\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ = h/(2π) and h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js).\n\nGiven that the electron is confined within a region of size 100 nm, we can assume that the uncertainty in position (Δx) is approximately equal to the size of the region:\n\nΔx ≈ 100 nm = 100 x 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2Δx)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔp ≥ (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js)/(2π * 2 * 100 x 10^(-9) m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.272 x 10^(-25) kg m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in position (Δx) is approximately 100 nm, and the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is approximately 5.272 x 10^(-25) kg m/s."
