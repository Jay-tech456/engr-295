    "message_2": "To find the probability of a quantum harmonic oscillator being in a specific energy state, we need to know the wave function of the system and the energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe quantum harmonic oscillator has equally spaced energy levels given by:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nHere, E_n is the energy of the nth level, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator, and n is an integer representing the energy level.\n\nThe wave function of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the nth energy state is given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = N_n * H_n(αx) * exp(-α^2 * x^2 / 2)\n\nHere, ψ_n(x) is the wave function of the nth energy state, N_n is the normalization constant, H_n(x) is the nth Hermite polynomial, and α is a constant related to the mass (m) and frequency (ω) of the oscillator: α = sqrt(mω/ħ).\n\nTo find the probability of the oscillator being in a specific energy state, we need to know the coefficients of the linear combination of the energy eigenstates that make up the wave function of the system. Suppose the wave function of the system is given by:\n\nΨ(x) = ∑ c_n * ψ_n(x)\n\nHere, Ψ(x) is the wave function of the system, c_n is the coefficient of the nth energy eigenstate, and the sum is over all energy eigenstates.\n\nThe probability of finding the quantum harmonic oscillator in the nth energy state is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient c_n:\n\nP(n) = |c_n|^2\n\nTo find the coefficients c_n, we need to project the wave function of the system onto the energy eigenstates:\n\nc_n = ∫ ψ_n(x) * Ψ(x) dx\n\nOnce we have the coefficients c_n, we can calculate the probability of finding the quantum harmonic oscillator in a specific energy state using the formula P(n) = |c_n|^2."
