    "message_2": "To find the energy of the first excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the energy level formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is the energy level (n = 0 for the ground state, n = 1 for the first excited state, etc.), h is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 1), the formula becomes:\n\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) * h * f\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the frequency (f = 10 Hz) and Planck's constant:\n\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (10 Hz)\n\nE_1 = (3/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (10 Hz)\n\nE_1 = (3/2) * (6.626 x 10^-33 J)\n\nE_1 â‰ˆ 9.939 x 10^-33 J\n\nSo, the energy of the first excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 9.939 x 10^-33 Joules."
