    "message_2": "To calculate the uncertainty in momentum, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant (ħ/2).\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nGiven the standard deviation in position (Δx) as 0.01 nanometers, we can convert it to meters:\n\nΔx = 0.01 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation to solve for the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2*Δx)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nΔp ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 0.01 * 10^(-9) m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.272859 × 10^(-28) kg m/s\n\nSo, the uncertainty in momentum of the electron is greater than or equal to 5.272859 × 10^(-28) kg m/s."
