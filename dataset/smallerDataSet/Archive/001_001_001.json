Use the Schrödinger equation to solve for the allowed energy states and their wave functions.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding a particle with a given energy in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential, we first need to solve the Schrödinger equation for the allowed energy states and their wave functions.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional infinite square well potential is given by:\n\n- (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the particle (5 × 10^-26 kg), E is the energy of the particle, and ψ(x) is the wave function.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the infinite square well potential are:\n\nψ(0) = 0 and ψ(a) = 0\n\nwhere a is the width of the well (2 nm = 2 × 10^-9 m).\n\nThe general solution to the Schrödinger equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(a) = A * sin(ka) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), sin(ka) must be zero. This occurs when ka = nπ, where n is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...). Therefore, the allowed wave numbers are:\n\nk_n = nπ / a\n\nThe allowed energy states are given by:\n\nE_n = (ħ^2 * k_n^2) / (2m) = (ħ^2 * n^2 * π^2) / (2m * a^2)\n\nThe corresponding wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n * sin(k_n * x)\n\nwhere A_n is a normalization constant.\n\nTo find the probability of finding a particle with a given energy E, we need to know the initial state of the particle. If the particle is in the nth energy state, the probability of finding it with energy E_n is 1. If the particle is in a superposition of energy states, we need to find the coefficients of the superposition and calculate the probability accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the allowed energy states and their wave functions for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential can be found using the Schrödinger equation. The probability of finding a particle with a given energy depends on the initial state of the particle and requires additional information."
