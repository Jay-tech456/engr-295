    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the particle successfully tunneling through the barrier, we can use the transmission coefficient, which is given by the formula:\n\nT = |T|^2\n\nwhere T is the transmission amplitude. For a rectangular potential barrier, the transmission amplitude can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V^2 * sinh^2(ka)) / (4 * E * (V - E)))\n\nwhere\nV is the height of the potential barrier,\nE is the energy of the particle,\na is the width of the barrier, and\nk = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2),\nwhere m is the mass of the particle and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / (2 * pi), where h is the Planck constant).\n\nNow, let's analyze how the probability of tunneling changes as the energy of the particle is increased or decreased.\n\n1. If E increases (but still E < V):\nAs E approaches V, the difference (V - E) decreases, which in turn decreases the value of k. As k decreases, sinh^2(ka) also decreases. This leads to a decrease in the denominator of the expression for T, and hence the transmission coefficient T increases. So, as the energy of the particle increases, the probability of tunneling through the barrier also increases.\n\n2. If E decreases (but still E > 0):\nAs E decreases, the difference (V - E) increases, which in turn increases the value of k. As k increases, sinh^2(ka) also increases. This leads to an increase in the denominator of the expression for T, and hence the transmission coefficient T decreases. So, as the energy of the particle decreases, the probability of tunneling through the barrier also decreases.\n\nIn summary, the probability of a particle successfully tunneling through a potential barrier increases as its energy increases (but still less than the barrier height) and decreases as its energy decreases."
