    "message_2": "The BB84 protocol is a quantum key distribution scheme that allows two parties, Alice and Bob, to establish a shared secret key using quantum mechanics. The protocol uses a series of qubits sent from Alice to Bob, and the security of the key is based on the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe qubit error rate (QBER) is the percentage of qubits that are incorrectly transmitted due to noise or eavesdropping. In this case, the QBER is given as 1%.\n\nTo calculate the maximum amount of information that can be securely transmitted, we need to consider the transmission efficiency of the BB84 protocol. The transmission efficiency is determined by the fraction of qubits that can be used to generate the final secret key.\n\nThe BB84 protocol consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Alice prepares qubits in random states and sends them to Bob.\n2. Bob measures the qubits using random bases.\n3. Alice and Bob publicly compare their bases and discard qubits measured in different bases.\n4. Alice and Bob perform error correction and privacy amplification to generate the final secret key.\n\nThe transmission efficiency of the BB84 protocol is affected by the following factors:\n\n1. The fraction of qubits that are discarded due to different bases (50%).\n2. The fraction of qubits that are discarded due to the QBER (1%).\n3. The fraction of qubits that are used for error correction and privacy amplification (this depends on the specific error correction and privacy amplification schemes used).\n\nLet's calculate the transmission efficiency considering the first two factors:\n\nEfficiency = (1 - Fraction of qubits discarded due to different bases) * (1 - Fraction of qubits discarded due to QBER)\n\nEfficiency = (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.01) = 0.5 * 0.99 = 0.495\n\nSo, the transmission efficiency of the BB84 protocol with a 1% QBER, not considering error correction and privacy amplification, is 49.5% or 0.495 as a fraction.\n\nTo calculate the maximum amount of information that can be securely transmitted, we would need to know the specific error correction and privacy amplification schemes used, as well as the total number of qubits transmitted. However, the transmission efficiency without considering error correction and privacy amplification is 0.495."
