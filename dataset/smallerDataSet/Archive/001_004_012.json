    "message_2": "To calculate the energy difference between the n = 2 and n = 4 energy levels in the hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy for n = 2 and n = 4:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / (4^2) = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference between these two levels:\n\nΔE = E_4 - E_2 = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the n = 2 and n = 4 energy levels is 2.55 eV.\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of the photon released when a hydrogen atom transitions from the n = 4 to n = 2 energy level. We can use the formula:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js), and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy difference from eV to Joules:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J\n\nΔE = 2.55 eV * (1.602 x 10^(-19) J/eV) = 4.085 x 10^(-19) J\n\nNow, we can find the frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (4.085 x 10^(-19) J) / (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) = 6.165 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the photon released when a hydrogen atom transitions from the n = 4 to n = 2 energy level is approximately 6.165 x 10^14 Hz."
