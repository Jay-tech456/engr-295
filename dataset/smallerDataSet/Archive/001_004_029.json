    "message_2": "In a hydrogen atom, the energy of an electron in a particular energy level (n) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, Z is the atomic number (for hydrogen, Z = 1), and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the n = 3 energy level of a hydrogen atom, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV * (1^2 / 3^2)\nE_3 = -13.6 eV * (1 / 9)\nE_3 = -1.51 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the electron in the n = 3 energy level of a hydrogen atom is approximately -1.51 electron volts (eV)."
