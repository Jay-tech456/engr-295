    "message_2": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for efficiently factoring large integers, which has significant implications for cryptography. To factor a number N, Shor's algorithm requires a quantum computer with a number of qubits that is proportional to the number of bits in N.\n\nFor a 2048-bit integer, we need a quantum register with at least 2 * 2048 = 4096 qubits to perform the quantum Fourier transform. However, to achieve a success probability of 99%, we need to account for the possibility of errors and the need for error correction. A commonly used error-correcting code is the surface code, which requires a constant overhead of qubits for error correction. With the surface code, the overhead is typically around 10-20 times the number of logical qubits. Therefore, we would need approximately 10 * 4096 = 40,960 physical qubits for a 99% success probability.\n\nAs for the physical feasibility of building such a quantum computer, we are still in the early stages of quantum computing technology. The largest quantum computers currently available have on the order of 50-100 qubits, which is far from the 40,960 qubits required for this problem. However, research in quantum computing is progressing rapidly, and it is possible that we could see significant advancements in the coming years.\n\nIn summary, to factor a 2048-bit integer using Shor's algorithm with a 99% success probability, we would need a quantum computer with approximately 40,960 qubits. While this is currently not physically feasible, advancements in quantum computing technology could make it possible in the future."
