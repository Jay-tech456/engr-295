    "message_2": "To find the energy difference between the n = 3 and n = 2 energy levels in a quantum harmonic oscillator, we can use the energy formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the n = 3 level:\n\nE_3 = (3 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_3 = (3.5) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 x 10^14 Hz)\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the n = 2 level:\n\nE_2 = (2 + 1/2) * h * f\nE_2 = (2.5) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 x 10^14 Hz)\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference between the two levels:\n\nΔE = E_3 - E_2\nΔE = (3.5 * 6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 2.5 x 10^14 Hz) - (2.5 * 6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 2.5 x 10^14 Hz)\n\nFactor out the common terms:\n\nΔE = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 2.5 x 10^14 Hz * (3.5 - 2.5)\nΔE = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 2.5 x 10^14 Hz * 1\n\nNow, calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE ≈ 1.657 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, the energy difference between the n = 3 and n = 2 energy levels in a quantum harmonic oscillator with a frequency of 2.5 x 10^14 Hz is approximately 1.657 x 10^-19 Joules."
