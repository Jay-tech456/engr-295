    "message_2": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant (ħ):\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in the velocity (Δv) of a particle, we first need to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). We are given the uncertainty in position (Δx) as 0.1 Å, which is equivalent to 1.0 × 10^-10 meters.\n\nRearranging the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation to solve for Δp:\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.054 × 10^-34 Js. Plugging in the values:\n\nΔp ≥ (1.054 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1.0 × 10^-10 m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.27 × 10^-25 kg m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum uncertainty in velocity (Δv). The relationship between momentum and velocity is given by:\n\np = m * v\n\nWhere p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity. We can rewrite this equation in terms of uncertainties:\n\nΔp = m * Δv\n\nSolving for Δv:\n\nΔv = Δp / m\n\nAssuming the particle is an electron, its mass (m) is approximately 9.11 × 10^-31 kg. Plugging in the values:\n\nΔv = (5.27 × 10^-25 kg m/s) / (9.11 × 10^-31 kg)\n\nΔv ≈ 5.78 × 10^5 m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the velocity of the particle is approximately 5.78 × 10^5 m/s."
