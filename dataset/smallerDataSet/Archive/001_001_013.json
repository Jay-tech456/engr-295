    "message_2": "The wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional box with infinitely high potential walls at x=0 and x=L can be described by the solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L and V(x) = ∞ for x ≤ 0 and x ≥ L. The solutions are given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) representing the energy level or quantum number, and L is the length of the box.\n\nThe probability density is given by the square of the wave function:\n\nP_n(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/L) * sin^2(nπx/L)\n\nFor the ground state (n = 1), the probability density is:\n\nP_1(x) = (2/L) * sin^2(πx/L)\n\nIn the ground state, the probability density is highest in the center of the box (x = L/2) and goes to zero at the walls (x = 0 and x = L).\n\nFor the first excited state (n = 2), the probability density is:\n\nP_2(x) = (2/L) * sin^2(2πx/L)\n\nIn the first excited state, the probability density has a node at the center of the box (x = L/2), where the probability density is zero. The probability density is highest at x = L/4 and x = 3L/4, and goes to zero at the walls (x = 0 and x = L).\n\nIn summary, the probability density for the ground state has a single maximum at the center of the box, while the first excited state has two maxima symmetrically located around the center, with a node at the center."
