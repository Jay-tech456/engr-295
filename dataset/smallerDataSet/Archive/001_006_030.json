    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, electrons are fired towards a barrier with two slits, and a screen is placed behind the barrier to observe the resulting interference pattern. The probability distribution of electrons passing through the double-slit experiment can be described using quantum mechanics, specifically, the wave function of the electrons.\n\nThe wave function (ψ) of an electron is a complex-valued function that describes the probability amplitude of the electron's position. The probability distribution of the electron's position is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, i.e., |ψ|^2.\n\nWhen an electron passes through the double-slit experiment, its wave function can be represented as the sum of the wave functions for each slit, assuming the slits are identical:\n\nψ_total = ψ_1 + ψ_2\n\nThe probability distribution of the electrons is then given by the square of the magnitude of the total wave function:\n\nP(x) = |ψ_total|^2 = |ψ_1 + ψ_2|^2\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\nP(x) = |ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_2|^2 + 2 * Re(ψ_1 * ψ_2*)\n\nHere, Re(ψ_1 * ψ_2*) represents the real part of the product of ψ_1 and the complex conjugate of ψ_2. The first two terms in the expression, |ψ_1|^2 and |ψ_2|^2, represent the probability distribution of electrons if only one of the slits were open. The last term, 2 * Re(ψ_1 * ψ_2*), represents the interference between the two slits.\n\nThe interference term causes the resulting probability distribution to exhibit an interference pattern on the screen, with alternating bright and dark fringes. The bright fringes correspond to constructive interference (where the probability of finding an electron is high), and the dark fringes correspond to destructive interference (where the probability of finding an electron is low).\n\nIn summary, the probability distribution of electrons passing through a double-slit experiment is given by the square of the magnitude of the sum of the wave functions for each slit. This distribution results in an interference pattern on the screen, which is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics and demonstrates the wave-particle duality of electrons."
