    "message_2": "The maximum distance for quantum teleportation achieved so far is around 1,400 kilometers (870 miles). This was accomplished in 2017 by a team of Chinese researchers who used the Micius satellite to teleport a photon's quantum state between two ground stations.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this distance is not a fundamental limit. The main challenge in increasing the distance for quantum teleportation lies in maintaining the entanglement between particles over long distances. This is because entanglement is easily disrupted by environmental factors, such as absorption and scattering of photons in the atmosphere or in optical fibers.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers are working on developing quantum repeaters, which can help maintain entanglement over longer distances by periodically refreshing the entangled state. Additionally, satellite-based quantum communication systems, like the one used in the Micius experiment, can help bypass some of the limitations imposed by Earth's atmosphere.\n\nIn summary, the current maximum distance for quantum teleportation is around 1,400 kilometers, but this is not a fundamental limit. As technology advances and new methods are developed to maintain entanglement over longer distances, we can expect the maximum distance for quantum teleportation to increase."
