    "message_2": "The ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator can be found using the formula:\n\nE = (1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E is the ground state energy, hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe angular frequency omega can be calculated using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (10 N/m) and m is the mass (0.1 kg).\n\nFirst, let's calculate omega:\n\nomega = sqrt(10 / 0.1) = sqrt(100) = 10 rad/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the ground state energy:\n\nE = (1/2) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) * (10 rad/s)\nE = 5.272859 × 10^-34 J\n\nSo, the ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 5.27 × 10^-34 Joules."
