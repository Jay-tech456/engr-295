    "message_2": "In this scenario, the electron has already passed through the first Stern-Gerlach apparatus, and its spin has been measured along the vertical direction. The second apparatus is also set up along the same vertical direction. \n\nWhen an electron passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, it is subjected to a magnetic field gradient, which causes the electron to split into two possible paths based on its spin: spin-up (+1/2) and spin-down (-1/2) along the direction of the magnetic field gradient. In this case, the direction is vertical.\n\nSince the electron has already passed through the first apparatus, its spin state has been determined along the vertical direction. If the electron was measured to be in the spin-up state, it will remain in that state and pass through the second apparatus with a 100% probability of being measured as spin-up again. Similarly, if the electron was measured to be in the spin-down state, it will remain in that state and pass through the second apparatus with a 100% probability of being measured as spin-down again.\n\nTherefore, the probability of an electron passing through a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus set up along the same direction as the first apparatus, given that the electron has already passed through the first apparatus and its spin was measured along the vertical direction, is 100%."
