    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to move an electron from the ground state (n1 = 1) to the first excited state (n2 = 2) of a hydrogen atom, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E2 - E1 = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, E1 and E2 are the energies of the initial and final states, n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, and 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n2:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1) = -13.6 eV * (-3/4) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to move an electron from the ground state to the first excited state of a hydrogen atom is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
