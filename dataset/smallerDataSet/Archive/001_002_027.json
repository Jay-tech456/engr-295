    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of a particle with a given momentum, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nGiven the momentum p = 2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s)\nλ ≈ 2.65 x 10^-11 m\n\nNow, to find the range of possible positions the particle could be located within, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.055 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in momentum as Δp = 2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s. We can now solve for the uncertainty in position, Δx:\n\nΔx ≥ (ħ / 2) / Δp\nΔx ≥ (1.055 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 2.5 x 10^-23 kg m/s)\nΔx ≥ 2.11 x 10^-12 m\n\nSo, the range of possible positions the particle could be located within is approximately 2.11 x 10^-12 meters."
