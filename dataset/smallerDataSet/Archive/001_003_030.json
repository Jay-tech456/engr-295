    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the transmission probability of an electron tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier. This formula is derived from the Schrödinger equation and is given by:\n\nT = (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))^-1\n\nwhere T is the transmission probability, V₀ is the potential barrier height, E is the kinetic energy of the electron, k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier, a is the width of the barrier, and sinh is the hyperbolic sine function.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nKinetic energy (E) = 10 eV = 10 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = 1.6 x 10^-18 J\nPotential barrier (V₀) = 5 eV = 5 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = 8 x 10^-19 J\nWidth of the barrier (a) = 1 nm = 1 x 10^-9 m\nMass of the electron (m) = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg\n\nNext, we need to find the wave vector inside the barrier (k2). We can do this using the following formula:\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V₀ - E) / ħ^2)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg * (8 x 10^-19 J - 1.6 x 10^-18 J) / (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg * 6.4 x 10^-19 J / (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nk2 ≈ 1.38 x 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the transmission probability formula:\n\nT = (1 + (8 x 10^-19 J^2 * sinh^2(1.38 x 10^10 m^-1 * 1 x 10^-9 m)) / (4 * 1.6 x 10^-18 J * (8 x 10^-19 J - 1.6 x 10^-18 J)))^-1\nT ≈ (1 + (8 x 10^-19 J^2 * sinh^2(1.38 x 10^1)) / (4 * 1.6 x 10^-18 J * (-8 x 10^-19 J)))^-1\nT ≈ (1 + (8 x 10^-19 J^2 * sinh^2(13.8)) / (-5.12 x 10^-36 J^2))^-1\nT ≈ (1 + 0.000102)^-1\nT ≈ 0.9999\n\nThe probability of an electron with a kinetic energy of 10 eV tunneling through a potential barrier of 5 eV and a width of 1 nm is approximately 0.9999 or 99.99%."
