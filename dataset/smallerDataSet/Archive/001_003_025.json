    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier, we will use the transmission coefficient (T) from quantum mechanics, which is given by the formula:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wave number K. The wave number inside the barrier is given by:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (U - E)) / hbar\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy of the particle, U is the height of the potential barrier, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / (2 * pi), where h is the Planck constant).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for K and L into the transmission coefficient formula:\n\nT = e^(-2 * sqrt(2 * m * (U - E)) * L / hbar)\n\nThe probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier is given by the transmission coefficient T."
