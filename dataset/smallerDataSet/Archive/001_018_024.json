    "message_1": "A physics student is required to calculate the quantum bit error rate (QBER) for a quantum key distribution system with a hypothetical channel length of 100 km and a fiber loss rate of 0.2 dB/km. The system sends 10,000 qubits from the sender to the receiver with a fixed polarisation state. The student should assume that the channel is a passive channel without any eavesdropping attack, and that the detectors at both the ends are ideal.",
    "message_2": "In a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is the ratio of the number of incorrect bits received to the total number of bits sent. In this case, we are given a channel length of 100 km and a fiber loss rate of 0.2 dB/km. Since the channel is passive and there is no eavesdropping attack, the errors will only be due to the fiber loss.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total fiber loss for the 100 km channel:\n\nTotal fiber loss = fiber loss rate * channel length\nTotal fiber loss = 0.2 dB/km * 100 km = 20 dB\n\nNow, we need to convert the total fiber loss from dB to a linear scale:\n\nTransmission coefficient (T) = 10^(-total fiber loss / 10)\nT = 10^(-20 / 10) = 10^(-2) = 0.01\n\nThe transmission coefficient represents the probability of a qubit being transmitted successfully through the channel. Since the detectors are ideal, we can assume that the probability of a qubit being received correctly is equal to the transmission coefficient.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of qubits received correctly:\n\nNumber of qubits received correctly = total qubits sent * T\nNumber of qubits received correctly = 10,000 * 0.01 = 100\n\nSince there are no other sources of error, the number of incorrect bits received is zero. Therefore, the QBER is:\n\nQBER = number of incorrect bits received / total number of bits sent\nQBER = 0 / 10,000 = 0\n\nIn this case, the quantum bit error rate (QBER) for the quantum key distribution system is 0."
