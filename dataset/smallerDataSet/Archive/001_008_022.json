    "message_2": "The magnetic moment of an electron (μ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nμ = -g * μ_B * S\n\nwhere g is the electron's g-factor (approximately 2 for a free electron), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T), and S is the electron's spin quantum number (1/2 for an electron).\n\nμ = -2 * (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T) * (1/2)\n\nμ = -9.274 x 10^-24 J/T\n\nSince the spin is parallel to the magnetic field vector, the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field. The magnetic moment of the electron in the external magnetic field of 2 T is -9.274 x 10^-24 J/T."
