    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier, we can use the formula for the transmission coefficient (T) in quantum mechanics, which is given by:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the potential barrier height from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J. So, 20 eV = 20 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = 3.2 x 10^-18 J.\n\nNext, we need to find the wave number (K) inside the barrier. The wave number is given by:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * U / h^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, U is the potential barrier height, and h is the reduced Planck constant (h = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nK = sqrt(2 * 10^-24 kg * 3.2 x 10^-18 J / (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nK ≈ 3.48 x 10^9 m^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission coefficient (T):\n\nT = e^(-2 * 3.48 x 10^9 m^-1 * 10^-9 m)\nT ≈ e^(-6.96)\nT ≈ 0.00095\n\nSo, the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier is approximately 0.095% or 9.5 x 10^-4."
