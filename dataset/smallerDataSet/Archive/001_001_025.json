    "message_2": "The Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential is given by:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, V(x) is the potential energy function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nFor an infinite square well potential, V(x) = 0 inside the well (0 < x < a) and V(x) = ∞ outside the well. Therefore, the Schrödinger equation inside the well becomes:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.\n\nSince the wave function must be continuous and go to zero at the boundaries of the well (x = 0 and x = a), we have:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(a) = A sin(ka) = 0\n\nThe second condition implies that ka must be a multiple of π, so:\n\nka = nπ, where n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the allowed wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = A_n sin(nπx/a)\n\nTo normalize the wave function, we need to find A_n such that the integral of |ψ_n(x)|² from 0 to a is equal to 1:\n\n∫[0, a] |ψ_n(x)|² dx = 1\n\nSolving for A_n, we get:\n\nA_n = sqrt(2/a)\n\nSo, the normalized wave functions are:\n\nψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nNow, let's find the energy levels. From the relation ka = nπ, we have:\n\nk = nπ/a\n\nRecall that k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, so:\n\nE = (ħ²k²)/(2m) = (ħ²(nπ/a)²)/(2m) = (n²π²ħ²)/(2ma²)\n\nThe energy of the particle depends on the size of the well as:\n\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2ma²)\n\nwhere n is a positive integer, and the energy levels are quantized. As the size of the well (a) increases, the energy levels become closer together."
