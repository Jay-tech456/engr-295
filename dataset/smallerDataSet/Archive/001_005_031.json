    "message_2": "If two entangled particles are separated by larger distances that violate Bell's inequality, it would imply that there is some sort of \"spooky action at a distance\" occurring, as described by Albert Einstein. This means that the entangled particles would still be able to instantaneously affect each other's states, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nThe consequences of this phenomenon would be significant for our understanding of quantum mechanics and the nature of reality. It would suggest that the world is fundamentally non-local, meaning that particles can be connected in ways that transcend the limitations of space and time.\n\nThis would have implications for various fields, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography. For example, it could potentially enable the development of faster and more secure communication systems that rely on the principles of quantum entanglement.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that experiments conducted so far have consistently supported the predictions of quantum mechanics and the existence of entanglement, even at large distances. These experiments have shown that entangled particles can indeed violate Bell's inequality, suggesting that the world is indeed non-local at the quantum level."
