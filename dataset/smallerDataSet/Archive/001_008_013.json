    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic moment of an electron, we can use the formula:\n\nμ = g * μ_B * S\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment, g is the g-factor (for an electron, g ≈ 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton (μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T), and S is the quantum spin number.\n\nFor the first case, with a quantum spin number of 1/2:\n\nμ = 2 * (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (1/2)\nμ = (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T)\nμ ≈ 9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic moment for a quantum spin number of 3/2:\n\nμ = 2 * (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T) * (3/2)\nμ = 3 * (9.274 × 10^(-24) J/T)\nμ ≈ 27.822 × 10^(-24) J/T\n\nSo, when the quantum spin number is changed from 1/2 to 3/2, the magnetic moment increases by a factor of 3."
