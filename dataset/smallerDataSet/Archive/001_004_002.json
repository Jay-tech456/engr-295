    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n1 = 1) to its first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values for the ground state (n1 = 1) and the first excited state (n2 = 2):\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-3/4)\nΔE = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to excite a hydrogen atom from its ground state to its first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV)."
