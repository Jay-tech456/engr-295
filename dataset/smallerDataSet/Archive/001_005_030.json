    "message_2": "In a system of two entangled particles with total spin zero, the particles must be in a singlet state. This means that the two particles have opposite spins, such that the sum of their spins is zero. When measuring the spin of these entangled particles in a specific direction, there are two possible outcomes for each particle: spin up (+1/2) or spin down (-1/2).\n\nSince the particles are entangled and in a singlet state, if one particle is measured to be in the spin up state, the other particle must be in the spin down state, and vice versa. Therefore, the probability of finding the two entangled particles in opposite spin states when measured in a specific direction is 100%, as the particles must always be in opposite spin states to conserve the total spin of the system."
