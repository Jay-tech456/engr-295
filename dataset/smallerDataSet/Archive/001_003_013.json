    "message_2": "To find the probability of an electron tunneling through a potential barrier, we can use the transmission coefficient (T). For a rectangular potential barrier, the transmission coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V - E)))\n\nwhere:\n- V is the potential barrier height (10 eV)\n- E is the energy of the electron (8 eV)\n- a is the width of the potential barrier (5 nm)\n- k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier, which can be calculated as k2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2), where m is the electron mass, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nFirst, let's calculate k2:\n\nm = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg (electron mass)\nhbar = 1.054571817 × 10^-34 Js\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg * (10 eV - 8 eV) * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 J/eV / (1.054571817 × 10^-34 Js)^2)\nk2 ≈ 1.026 × 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow, let's calculate the transmission coefficient T:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V - E)))\nT = 1 / (1 + (10^2 * sinh^2(1.026 × 10^10 m^-1 * 5 × 10^-9 m)) / (4 * 8 * (10 - 8)))\nT ≈ 0.0028\n\nThe probability of finding the electron on the other side of the potential barrier is approximately 0.28%."
