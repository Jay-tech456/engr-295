    "message_2": "The uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h/2π, where h is the Planck constant).\n\nWhen an electron passes through one of the two closely spaced slits, its position becomes confined to the width of the slit. This confinement increases the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx). According to the uncertainty principle, if the uncertainty in position increases, the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) must also increase to maintain the inequality.\n\nThe increased uncertainty in momentum causes the electron's wavefunction to spread out as it propagates through space. This spreading out of the wavefunction leads to the interference pattern observed on the detector screen behind the slits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the uncertainty in the position of an electron that passes through one of the slits and use this value to determine the width of the interference pattern.\n\n1. Calculate the uncertainty in position (Δx):\n\nLet's assume the width of each slit is 'a'. Then, the uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately equal to the width of the slit:\n\nΔx ≈ a\n\n2. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nUsing the uncertainty principle:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2Δx)\n\n3. Determine the angular width of the interference pattern:\n\nThe uncertainty in momentum can be related to the angular width (θ) of the interference pattern using the de Broglie wavelength (λ) of the electron:\n\nΔp ≈ p * θ\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the electron, and λ = h/p.\n\nSubstituting the expression for Δp from step 2:\n\nθ ≈ (ħ/(2Δx)) * (1/p)\n\nθ ≈ (ħ/(2a)) * (λ/h)\n\nθ ≈ λ/(2a)\n\n4. Calculate the width of the interference pattern:\n\nIf the distance between the slits and the detector screen is 'L', the width of the interference pattern (W) can be calculated using the small-angle approximation:\n\nW ≈ L * θ\n\nW ≈ L * (λ/(2a))\n\nThe width of the interference pattern (W) depends on the distance between the slits and the detector screen (L), the de Broglie wavelength of the electron (λ), and the width of the slits (a). As the uncertainty in the electron's position increases (i.e., the slit width 'a' decreases), the width of the interference pattern (W) also increases."
