    "message_2": "When an electron passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus and its spin is measured along the z-axis, the expected outcome is that the electron will be found in one of two possible states: spin-up or spin-down. These two states correspond to the electron's intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, being aligned either parallel (spin-up) or antiparallel (spin-down) to the magnetic field gradient created by the apparatus.\n\nIn the context of quantum mechanics, the electron's spin along the z-axis can be represented by the eigenvalues +ħ/2 (spin-up) or -ħ/2 (spin-down), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The electron's wave function will collapse into one of these two states upon measurement, with probabilities determined by the initial state of the electron before entering the Stern-Gerlach apparatus."
