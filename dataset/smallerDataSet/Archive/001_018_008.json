    "message_1": "Problem: \nA quantum cryptography system uses a stream of photons to transmit a secret message. The message is encoded as a sequence of polarizations and the key is distributed using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. The system uses a photon detector with 80% efficiency to measure the received photons. If the system transmits 10,000 photons, what is the probability that an eavesdropper could intercept at least 1000 photons undetected?  Assume that the eavesdropper uses an identical detector with the same efficiency.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that an eavesdropper could intercept at least 1000 photons undetected, we need to consider the efficiency of the detectors and the number of photons intercepted.\n\nThe probability that a single photon is detected by the eavesdropper's detector is 80%, or 0.8. Therefore, the probability that a single photon is not detected (and thus undetected) is 20%, or 0.2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the eavesdropper intercepts 1000 photons. The probability that all 1000 photons go undetected is (0.2)^1000. However, we are interested in the probability that the eavesdropper intercepts at least 1000 photons undetected, which means we need to consider cases where more than 1000 photons are intercepted.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nwhere X is the number of undetected photons, k is the threshold (1000 photons in this case), and P(X < k) is the cumulative probability of detecting fewer than 1000 photons.\n\nWe can calculate P(X < k) using the binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n\nP(X < k) = Σ [C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)]\n\nwhere n is the total number of photons (10,000), x is the number of undetected photons, p is the probability of a photon being undetected (0.2), and C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nCalculating this sum for x = 0 to 999 and subtracting it from 1 will give us the probability that an eavesdropper could intercept at least 1000 photons undetected. However, this calculation is computationally intensive and may require specialized software or libraries to compute accurately.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a binomial distribution can be calculated as follows:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nFor our problem, μ = 10,000 * 0.2 = 2,000 and σ = sqrt(10,000 * 0.2 * 0.8) ≈ 40.\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability:\n\nZ = (k - μ) / σ\n\nFor k = 1000, Z ≈ (1000 - 2000) / 40 ≈ -25.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z < -25) is extremely close to 0. Therefore, the probability that an eavesdropper could intercept at least 1000 photons undetected is also extremely close to 0. This means that it is highly unlikely for an eavesdropper to intercept at least 1000 photons undetected."
