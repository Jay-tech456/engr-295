    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the position of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (h-bar) divided by 2:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js.\n\nIn this case, we know the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to be 2.5 × 10^-24 kg m/s. We can rearrange the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation to solve for the uncertainty in position (Δx):\n\nΔx ≥ ħ / (2 * Δp)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 2.5 × 10^-24 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 Js) / (5 × 10^-24 kg m/s)\n\nΔx ≥ 2.108 × 10^-11 m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 2.108 × 10^-11 meters."
