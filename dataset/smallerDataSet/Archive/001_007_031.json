    "message_2": "The ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * h_bar * omega\n\nwhere E_0 is the ground state energy, h_bar is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.0545718 Ã— 10^-34 Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe angular frequency omega can be calculated from the spring constant (k) and the mass (m) of the oscillator using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nHowever, the mass of the oscillator is not provided in the problem. To proceed, we need the mass of the oscillator. Once the mass is provided, we can calculate the ground state energy using the formulas above."
