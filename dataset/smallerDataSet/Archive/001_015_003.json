    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the maximum distance between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) is mainly limited by the attenuation of the optical fiber used for transmission and the efficiency of the detectors. The attenuation of the optical fiber is usually measured in dB/km, and the typical value for the wavelength of 1550 nm is around 0.2 dB/km.\n\nLet's first calculate the attenuation in dB for a given distance (d) and then find the maximum distance for which the detection efficiency is still 80%.\n\nAttenuation (A) = α * d, where α is the attenuation coefficient (0.2 dB/km).\n\nThe relation between the attenuation in dB and the transmission coefficient (T) is given by:\n\nA = -10 * log10(T)\n\nNow, we know that the detection efficiency is 80%, which means that the transmission coefficient should be 0.8. We can now solve for the attenuation:\n\nA = -10 * log10(0.8) ≈ 0.97 dB\n\nNow, we can find the maximum distance (d) for this attenuation:\n\nd = A / α = 0.97 dB / 0.2 dB/km ≈ 4.85 km\n\nSo, the maximum distance between the sender and the receiver in the quantum teleportation protocol, assuming the entangled particles are photons with a wavelength of 1550 nm and a detection efficiency of 80%, is approximately 4.85 kilometers. However, this is a simplified calculation that does not take into account other factors such as noise, losses in the quantum teleportation process, and the efficiency of the entanglement generation and distribution. In practice, the maximum distance might be shorter due to these factors."
