    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to excite an electron in a hydrogen atom from the ground state (n1 = 1) to the first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the Rydberg formula for energy difference:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2² - 1/n1²)\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference, n1 and n2 are the initial and final energy levels, and 13.6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2² - 1/1²)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1)\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (-3/4)\n\nThe energy required to excite the electron is:\n\nΔE = 10.2 eV"
