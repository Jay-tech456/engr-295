    "message_1": "A quantum computer has a qubit that is in a superposition state of |0⟩ and |1⟩. However, due to environmental noise, the qubit has a 20% chance of flipping from the initial state to the opposite one before measurement. Using quantum error correction codes, what is the minimum number of additional qubits that must be added to the system to ensure that the initial state of the qubit is accurately measured with a probability of at least 95%?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that the initial state of the qubit is accurately measured with a probability of at least 95%, we can use a quantum error correction code called the Shor code or the 9-qubit code. The Shor code is a method for protecting a single qubit from both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by encoding it into a larger number of qubits.\n\nIn the Shor code, the original qubit is encoded into 9 qubits, which means that we need to add 8 additional qubits to the system. The Shor code can correct for any single qubit error, which includes the 20% chance of flipping from the initial state to the opposite one before measurement.\n\nBy using the Shor code and adding 8 additional qubits to the system, we can ensure that the initial state of the qubit is accurately measured with a probability of at least 95%."
