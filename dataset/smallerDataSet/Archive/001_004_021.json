    "message_2": "To calculate the energy needed to ionize a hydrogen atom in its second excited state, we need to find the energy difference between the second excited state and the ionized state.\n\nThe energy levels of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the second excited state, n = 3. So, the energy of the second excited state is:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV\n\nFor the ionized state, the energy is 0 eV, as the electron is completely removed from the atom.\n\nNow, we can find the energy needed to ionize the hydrogen atom in the second excited state by finding the difference between the energies of the ionized state and the second excited state:\n\nΔE = E_ionized - E_3 = 0 eV - (-1.51 eV) = 1.51 eV\n\nSo, the energy needed to ionize a hydrogen atom in its second excited state is approximately 1.51 eV."
