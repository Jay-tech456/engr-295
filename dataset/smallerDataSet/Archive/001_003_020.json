    "message_1": "A particle of mass m approaches a potential barrier of height V0 and width a. Determine the probability of the particle penetrating the barrier if its kinetic energy is E < V0. Use the time-independent Schrödinger equation to calculate the transmission coefficient.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2m/h^2)(E - V(x))Ψ(x) = 0\n\nwhere Ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, h is the reduced Planck constant, E is the kinetic energy of the particle, and V(x) is the potential energy function.\n\nSince the potential barrier has a height V0 and width a, we can define the potential energy function V(x) as:\n\nV(x) = V0 for 0 < x < a\nV(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nNow, we will solve the Schrödinger equation in three regions:\n\n1. Region I (x < 0): In this region, V(x) = 0, so the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2mE/h^2)Ψ(x) = 0\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nΨ_I(x) = A * exp(ikx) + B * exp(-ikx)\n\nwhere k = sqrt(2mE)/h and A and B are constants.\n\n2. Region II (0 < x < a): In this region, V(x) = V0, so the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2m/h^2)(E - V0)Ψ(x) = 0\n\nLet q = sqrt(2m(V0 - E))/h. The general solution to this equation is:\n\nΨ_II(x) = C * exp(qx) + D * exp(-qx)\n\nwhere C and D are constants.\n\n3. Region III (x > a): In this region, V(x) = 0, so the Schrödinger equation is the same as in Region I:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2mE/h^2)Ψ(x) = 0\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nΨ_III(x) = F * exp(ikx)\n\nwhere F is a constant. Note that there is no term with exp(-ikx) since the particle is moving to the right.\n\nNow, we need to apply boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = a to find the constants A, B, C, D, and F:\n\nΨ_I(0) = Ψ_II(0) => A + B = C + D\nΨ'_I(0) = Ψ'_II(0) => ik(A - B) = q(C - D)\n\nΨ_II(a) = Ψ_III(a) => C * exp(qa) + D * exp(-qa) = F * exp(ika)\nΨ'_II(a) = Ψ'_III(a) => q(C * exp(qa) - D * exp(-qa)) = ikF * exp(ika)\n\nNow, we have a system of four linear equations with five unknowns (A, B, C, D, F). To find the transmission coefficient T, we need to find the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude:\n\nT = |F|^2 / |A|^2\n\nTo find T, we can eliminate the other constants (B, C, D) from the equations and solve for T. After some algebraic manipulations, we get:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V0^2 * sinh^2(qa)) / (4E(V0 - E) * cos^2(ka)))\n\nThis is the transmission coefficient, which represents the probability of the particle penetrating the potential barrier. Note that this result is valid for E < V0, as stated in the problem."
