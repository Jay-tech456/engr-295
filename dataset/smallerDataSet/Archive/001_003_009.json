    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an alpha particle passing through a potential barrier, we can use the quantum mechanical tunneling phenomenon. The transmission probability can be calculated using the formula for a rectangular potential barrier:\n\nT = exp(-2 * kappa * L)\n\nwhere T is the transmission probability, kappa is the decay constant, and L is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant kappa. The formula for kappa is:\n\nkappa = (2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)^(1/2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the alpha particle, V is the height of the barrier, E is the energy of the alpha particle, and hbar is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nThe mass of an alpha particle (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) is approximately 6.64 × 10^(-27) kg. The height of the barrier V is 3 MeV, which is equivalent to 4.8 × 10^(-13) J. The energy of the alpha particle E is 5 MeV, which is equivalent to 8 × 10^(-13) J. The reduced Planck's constant hbar is approximately 1.05 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nNow we can calculate kappa:\n\nkappa = (2 * 6.64 × 10^(-27) kg * (4.8 × 10^(-13) J - 8 × 10^(-13) J) / (1.05 × 10^(-34) Js)^2)^(1/2)\nkappa = (2 * 6.64 × 10^(-27) kg * (-3.2 × 10^(-13) J) / (1.05 × 10^(-34) Js)^2)^(1/2)\n\nkappa ≈ 1.35 × 10^10 m^(-1)\n\nNow we can calculate the transmission probability T:\n\nT = exp(-2 * 1.35 × 10^10 m^(-1) * 5 × 10^(-9) m)\nT ≈ exp(-13.5)\n\nT ≈ 1.47 × 10^(-6)\n\nSo the probability of an alpha particle passing through the potential barrier is approximately 1.47 × 10^(-6) or 0.000147%."
