    "message_2": "To find the normalized wave function of the particle, we need to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the one-dimensional infinite potential well. The potential inside the well (0 < x < L) is zero, and the potential outside the well is infinite. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nSince V(x) = 0 inside the well, the equation becomes:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = E * ψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere k² = 2mE / ħ², and A and B are constants.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(L) = 0, we get:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\n\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), sin(kL) must be zero. This implies that kL = nπ, where n is a positive integer. Therefore, k = nπ / L.\n\nNow, the wave function becomes:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(nπx / L)\n\nTo normalize the wave function, we need to find the constant A. The normalization condition is:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\n∫ (A * sin(nπx / L))² dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nA² * ∫ sin²(nπx / L) dx = 1, from 0 to L\n\nIntegrating sin²(nπx / L) from 0 to L gives L/2, so:\n\nA² * (L/2) = 1\n\nA = sqrt(2/L)\n\nThus, the normalized wave function is:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx / L)\n\nNow, let's find the lowest possible energy level for the particle's state. The energy E is related to k by:\n\nk² = 2mE / ħ²\n\nSubstituting k = nπ / L, we get:\n\n(nπ / L)² = 2mE / ħ²\n\nThe lowest possible energy level corresponds to n = 1. Therefore, the lowest energy level E₁ is:\n\nE₁ = (π²ħ² / 2mL²) * 1²\n\nE₁ = π²ħ² / (2mL²)\n\nSo, the lowest possible energy level for the particle's state is E₁ = π²ħ² / (2mL²), and the corresponding normalized wave function is ψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(πx / L)."
