    "message_2": "To find the probability of the particle being in the first excited state after a time interval t = π/4ω₀, we need to use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the concept of time-evolution of wave functions.\n\nThe wave function of the ground state of a harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nψ₀(x) = (mω₀/(πħ))^(1/4) * exp(-mω₀x²/(2ħ))\n\nThe wave function of the first excited state is given by:\n\nψ₁(x) = (mω₀/(πħ))^(1/4) * sqrt(2) * (mω₀x/ħ) * exp(-mω₀x²/(2ħ))\n\nThe time-evolution of the wave function is given by:\n\nψ(x,t) = ψ₀(x) * exp(-iE₀t/ħ) + c₁ * ψ₁(x) * exp(-iE₁t/ħ)\n\nwhere c₁ is the probability amplitude of the first excited state and E₁ is the energy of the first excited state. Since the particle is initially in the ground state, c₁ = 0 at t = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability amplitude c₁ at time t = π/4ω₀. To do this, we can use the time-dependent perturbation theory. In this case, we can assume that there is a small perturbation in the potential V(x) that couples the ground state to the first excited state. The first-order perturbation in the probability amplitude is given by:\n\nc₁(t) = - (1/ħ) * ∫[ψ₀(x) * V'(x) * ψ₁(x)] dx * ∫[exp(i(E₁ - E₀)t')] dt'\n\nwhere V'(x) is the perturbation in the potential and t' is a dummy variable for integration.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integrals and find the value of c₁(t) at t = π/4ω₀. After evaluating the integrals, we can find the probability of the particle being in the first excited state by taking the square of the magnitude of c₁(t):\n\nP(1st excited state) = |c₁(t)|²\n\nThis will give us the probability of the particle being in the first excited state after a time interval t = π/4ω₀."
