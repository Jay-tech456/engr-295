    "message_2": "To determine the maximum distance for secure communication using quantum key distribution (QKD), we need to consider several factors, including the photon loss rate, detector efficiency, and the specific QKD protocol being used. For simplicity, let's consider the widely used BB84 protocol.\n\nIn the BB84 protocol, the secure key rate (R) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nR = p_d * (1 - h(QBER)) * R_raw\n\nwhere:\n- p_d is the probability of detecting a single photon,\n- h(QBER) is the binary entropy function of the quantum bit error rate (QBER), and\n- R_raw is the raw key rate (the rate at which photons are transmitted).\n\nThe probability of detecting a single photon (p_d) depends on the channel loss and detector efficiency. Channel loss is usually expressed in terms of the photon loss rate (L) in dB/km. The relationship between the channel transmittance (T) and the photon loss rate is given by:\n\nT = 10^(-L * d / 10)\n\nwhere d is the distance in kilometers.\n\nThe probability of detecting a single photon (p_d) can be calculated as:\n\np_d = T * η\n\nwhere η is the detector efficiency.\n\nNow, to find the maximum distance for secure communication, we need to consider the point at which the secure key rate (R) becomes zero. This occurs when:\n\np_d * (1 - h(QBER)) * R_raw = 0\n\nSince R_raw is always positive, we can focus on the term (1 - h(QBER)). The QBER increases with distance, and at a certain point, it will be too high to maintain secure communication. For the BB84 protocol, the maximum tolerable QBER is around 11% (h(QBER) ≈ 0.5).\n\nTo find the maximum distance (d_max), we can use the relationship between p_d and T:\n\np_d = T * η = 10^(-L * d_max / 10) * η\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for d_max:\n\nd_max = (-10 / L) * log10(p_d / η)\n\nGiven the specific photon loss rate (L) and detector efficiency (η), you can calculate the maximum distance (d_max) for secure communication using the BB84 protocol. Keep in mind that this is a simplified analysis, and other factors such as noise, dark counts, and finite-key effects may also influence the maximum distance in a real-world scenario."
