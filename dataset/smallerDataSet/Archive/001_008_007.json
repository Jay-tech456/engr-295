    "message_2": "To find the spin angular momentum of an electron with a magnetic quantum number m = -1/2, we can use the formula:\n\nS = ħ * √(s * (s + 1))\n\nwhere S is the spin angular momentum, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J s), and s is the electron's spin quantum number. For an electron, s = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's calculate S:\n\nS = ħ * √((1/2) * (1/2 + 1))\nS = ħ * √((1/2) * (3/2))\nS = ħ * √(3/4)\nS = (ħ/2) * √3\n\nThe spin angular momentum of an electron with magnetic quantum number m = -1/2 is (ħ/2) * √3.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding magnetic moment. The magnetic moment (μ) is related to the spin angular momentum (S) and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) by the following equation:\n\nμ = γ * S\n\nFor an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio is given by:\n\nγ = -e / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.60217663 × 10^-19 C) and m_e is the electron mass (approximately 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg).\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic moment:\n\nμ = (-e / (2 * m_e)) * ((ħ/2) * √3)\nμ = (-1.60217663 × 10^-19 C / (2 * 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg)) * (1.0545718 × 10^-34 J s * √3 / 2)\nμ = (-8.794 × 10^10 C/kg) * (9.274 × 10^-24 J/T)\n\nThe magnetic moment of an electron with magnetic quantum number m = -1/2 is approximately -8.174 × 10^-24 J/T."
