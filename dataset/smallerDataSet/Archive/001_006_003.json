    "message_2": "In the double-slit experiment, a light source (or other particles like electrons) passes through two narrow slits, creating an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits. The interference pattern consists of alternating bright and dark fringes, which are the result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves or particles.\n\nThe relationship between the distance between the two slits (d), the distance between the interference fringes on the screen (Δy), the distance between the slits and the screen (L), and the wavelength of the incident particle (λ) can be described by the following equation:\n\nΔy = (λ * L) / d\n\nIn this equation, Δy is the distance between adjacent bright fringes (or adjacent dark fringes), λ is the wavelength of the incident particle, L is the distance between the slits and the screen, and d is the distance between the two slits.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the distance between the interference fringes (Δy) is directly proportional to the wavelength of the incident particle (λ) and the distance between the slits and the screen (L), and inversely proportional to the distance between the two slits (d).\n\nIf the wavelength of the incident particle (λ) increases, the distance between the interference fringes (Δy) will also increase. Conversely, if the wavelength decreases, the distance between the interference fringes will decrease. This means that the interference pattern will be more spread out for longer wavelengths and more compact for shorter wavelengths."
