    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, electrons are fired through two slits and create an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits. The interference pattern is a result of the wave-like nature of electrons, which can be described by their wavefunction. The probability distribution of the electrons can be determined using the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe wavefunction of an electron passing through the double-slit experiment can be represented as the sum of the wavefunctions of the electron passing through each slit individually:\n\nΨ_total(x) = Ψ_1(x) + Ψ_2(x)\n\nHere, Ψ_total(x) is the total wavefunction, and Ψ_1(x) and Ψ_2(x) are the wavefunctions of the electron passing through slit 1 and slit 2, respectively.\n\nThe probability distribution of the electrons is given by the square of the magnitude of the total wavefunction:\n\nP(x) = |Ψ_total(x)|^2\n\nP(x) = |Ψ_1(x) + Ψ_2(x)|^2\n\nP(x) = Ψ_1(x) * Ψ_1*(x) + Ψ_2(x) * Ψ_2*(x) + Ψ_1(x) * Ψ_2*(x) + Ψ_2(x) * Ψ_1*(x)\n\nHere, Ψ_1*(x) and Ψ_2*(x) are the complex conjugates of Ψ_1(x) and Ψ_2(x), respectively.\n\nThe first two terms in the probability distribution represent the individual probabilities of the electron passing through each slit, while the last two terms represent the interference between the two slits.\n\nAs the distance between the slits and the screen is varied, the interference pattern changes due to the change in the path difference between the two slits. The path difference determines the phase difference between the two wavefunctions, which in turn affects the interference pattern.\n\nWhen the path difference is an integer multiple of the electron's wavelength (nλ), constructive interference occurs, and the probability of finding an electron at that point is maximum. When the path difference is an odd multiple of half the electron's wavelength ((2n+1)λ/2), destructive interference occurs, and the probability of finding an electron at that point is minimum.\n\nAs the distance between the slits and the screen increases, the interference pattern becomes more spread out, and the distance between the maxima and minima of the probability distribution increases. Conversely, as the distance between the slits and the screen decreases, the interference pattern becomes more compact, and the distance between the maxima and minima of the probability distribution decreases."
