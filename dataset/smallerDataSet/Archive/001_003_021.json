    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of an alpha particle with energy E penetrating a potential barrier of height U and width L via quantum tunneling, we can use the formula for the transmission probability (T) in the case of a rectangular potential barrier:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the decay constant, given by:\n\nK = (2 * m * (U - E) / hbar^2)^(1/2)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nE = 5 MeV = 5 * 10^6 eV\nU = 20 MeV = 20 * 10^6 eV\nL = 5 fm = 5 * 10^(-15) m\n\nWe also need to know the mass of the alpha particle (m) and the reduced Planck constant (hbar):\n\nm_alpha = 4 * m_p (since an alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons)\nm_p = 1.6726219 * 10^(-27) kg (mass of a proton)\nhbar = 1.0545718 * 10^(-34) J s\n\nNow, we can calculate the decay constant K:\n\nm_alpha = 4 * 1.6726219 * 10^(-27) kg = 6.6904876 * 10^(-27) kg\n\nK = ((2 * 6.6904876 * 10^(-27) kg * (20 * 10^6 eV - 5 * 10^6 eV) * 1.60218 * 10^(-19) J/eV) / (1.0545718 * 10^(-34) J s)^2)^(1/2)\n\nK ≈ 1.218 * 10^(10) m^(-1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission probability T:\n\nT = e^(-2 * 1.218 * 10^(10) m^(-1) * 5 * 10^(-15) m)\n\nT ≈ 2.64 * 10^(-6)\n\nSo, the probability of an alpha particle with energy of 5 MeV penetrating a potential barrier of 20 MeV and a width of 5 fm via quantum tunneling is approximately 2.64 * 10^(-6) or 0.000264%."
