    "message_2": "To find the probability of a particle with energy 6 eV penetrating the barrier, we can use the transmission probability formula for a rectangular potential barrier in quantum mechanics. The formula is given by:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V₀^2 * sinh^2(k₂ * a)) / (4 * E * (V₀ - E)))\n\nwhere T is the transmission probability, V₀ is the potential barrier height, E is the energy of the particle, k₂ is the wave number inside the barrier, and a is the width of the barrier.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nV₀ = 5 eV = 5 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) J\nE = 6 eV = 6 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) J\na = 1 nm = 1 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, let's find the wave number inside the barrier (k₂):\n\nk₂ = sqrt((2 * m * (V₀ - E)) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle (assuming it's an electron) and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nm = 9.11 * 10^(-31) kg (mass of an electron)\nhbar = 1.054 * 10^(-34) Js\n\nk₂ = sqrt((2 * 9.11 * 10^(-31) * (5 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) - 6 * 1.6 * 10^(-19))) / (1.054 * 10^(-34))^2)\nk₂ ≈ 1.026 * 10^10 m^(-1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission probability (T):\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (5 * 1.6 * 10^(-19))^2 * sinh^2(1.026 * 10^10 * 1 * 10^(-9)) / (4 * 6 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) * (5 * 1.6 * 10^(-19) - 6 * 1.6 * 10^(-19))))\nT ≈ 0.475\n\nSo, the probability that a particle with energy 6 eV is able to penetrate the barrier using the principles of quantum tunneling is approximately 47.5%."
