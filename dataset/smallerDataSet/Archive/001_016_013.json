    "message_2": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. To factorize the number 21 using Shor's algorithm, we need to determine the minimum number of qubits required.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of bits required to represent the number 21 in binary form. The binary representation of 21 is 10101, which requires 5 bits.\n\nShor's algorithm requires two quantum registers. The first register needs to have at least n qubits, where n is the number of bits required to represent the number to be factorized. The second register needs to have at least 2n qubits to ensure a high probability of success.\n\nSo, for the number 21, we need:\n\nFirst register: n = 5 qubits\nSecond register: 2n = 2 * 5 = 10 qubits\n\nIn total, we need a minimum of 5 + 10 = 15 qubits to factorize the number 21 using Shor's algorithm."
