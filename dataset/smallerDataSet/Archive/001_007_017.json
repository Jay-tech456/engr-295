    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle in the first excited state, we can use the energy levels formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth excited state, n is the quantum number (n = 1 for the first excited state), hbar is the reduced Planck's constant (hbar = 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency omega. We can do this using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (200 N/m) and m is the mass of the particle (0.5 kg).\n\nomega = sqrt(200 N/m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(400 s^(-2)) = 20 s^(-1)\n\nNow we can find the energy of the first excited state:\n\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) * hbar * omega = (3/2) * (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) * (20 s^(-1))\n\nE_1 = 3.1637154 × 10^(-33) J\n\nThe energy of the particle in the first excited state is approximately 3.16 × 10^(-33) joules.\n\nTo find the frequency of the oscillator, we can use the relation between angular frequency and frequency:\n\nomega = 2 * pi * f\n\nwhere f is the frequency in Hz.\n\nf = omega / (2 * pi) = (20 s^(-1)) / (2 * pi) ≈ 3.1830989 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the oscillator is approximately 3.18 Hz."
