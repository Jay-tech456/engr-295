    "message_2": "To calculate the energy of an electron in the n=3 energy level of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number (in this case, n=3).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / (3^2)\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 9\nE_3 â‰ˆ -1.51 eV\n\nSo, the energy of an electron in the n=3 energy level of a hydrogen atom is approximately -1.51 electron volts (eV)."
