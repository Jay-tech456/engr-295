    "message_2": "The energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * h * f\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and f is the frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe lowest possible energy level corresponds to n = 0. So, we can calculate the energy of the lowest level as follows:\n\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2) * h * f\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 x 10^12 Hz)\n\nE_0 = 0.5 * (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (2.5 x 10^12 s^-1)\n\nE_0 = 8.2825 x 10^-22 J\n\nThe lowest possible energy level of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 8.28 x 10^-22 Joules."
