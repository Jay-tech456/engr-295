    "message_1": "Here is a specific problem for the student to solve: \n\n\"Two electrons are entangled and separated by a large distance. One electron is measured to have a spin of up. What is the probability that the other electron has a spin of down and how does this demonstrate non-locality in quantum mechanics?\"",
    "message_2": "When two electrons are entangled, their quantum states become correlated in such a way that the measurement of one electron's spin immediately determines the spin of the other electron, regardless of the distance between them. In this problem, the two electrons are entangled, and one electron is measured to have a spin of up.\n\nSince the electrons are entangled, the measurement of one electron's spin will cause the other electron's spin to be the opposite. Therefore, if one electron is measured to have a spin of up, the other electron will have a spin of down with a probability of 100% (or certainty).\n\nThis phenomenon demonstrates non-locality in quantum mechanics because the entangled particles' properties are correlated even when they are separated by large distances. The measurement of one particle's spin instantly determines the spin of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them, which seems to defy our classical understanding of space and time. This non-local behavior is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally verified through tests of Bell's inequalities, which show that quantum mechanics cannot be explained by local hidden variables."
