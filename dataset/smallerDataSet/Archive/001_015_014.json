    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) share an entangled pair of qubits in the Bell state |Φ+⟩. The state |Φ+⟩ can be represented as:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nAlice has a qubit in the state |+⟩, which she wants to teleport to Bob. The state |+⟩ can be represented as:\n\n|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)\n\nThe combined state of Alice's qubit and the entangled pair is:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = |+⟩ ⊗ |Φ+⟩ = (1/2)(|000⟩ + |011⟩ + |100⟩ + |111⟩)\n\nNow, Alice performs a Bell measurement on her two qubits (the first and second qubits). This projects the combined state into one of the four Bell states. The probability of each Bell state is given by the squared amplitude of the corresponding term in the combined state. In this case, the probabilities are:\n\nP(Φ+|Ψ) = |(1/2)|^2 = 1/4\nP(Φ-|Ψ) = 0\nP(Ψ+|Ψ) = |(1/2)|^2 = 1/4\nP(Ψ-|Ψ) = 0\n\nAfter Alice's measurement, the state of Bob's qubit (the third qubit) is determined by the outcome of Alice's measurement:\n\n- If Alice measures |Φ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in state |+⟩.\n- If Alice measures |Φ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in state |-⟩.\n- If Alice measures |Ψ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in state |0⟩.\n- If Alice measures |Ψ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in state |1⟩.\n\nSince we want to know the probability that the qubit is successfully teleported in the state |+⟩, we only need to consider the case where Alice measures |Φ+⟩. The probability of successful teleportation is:\n\nP(success) = P(Φ+|Ψ) = 1/4\n\nSo, the probability of successfully teleporting the qubit in state |+⟩ using the quantum teleportation protocol with the initial entangled pair in state |Φ+⟩ is 1/4 or 25%."
