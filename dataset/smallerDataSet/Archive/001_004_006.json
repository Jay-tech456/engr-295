    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to move an electron from the n=2 energy level to the n=3 energy level in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E3 - E2 = (-13.6 eV / n^2)\n\nWhere ΔE is the energy difference, E3 is the energy of the n=3 level, E2 is the energy of the n=2 level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the n=2 and n=3 levels:\n\nE2 = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\nE3 = -13.6 eV / (3^2) = -13.6 eV / 9 = -1.51 eV\n\nNow, we can find the energy difference:\n\nΔE = E3 - E2 = -1.51 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 1.89 eV\n\nTo convert this energy to Joules, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 J:\n\nΔE = 1.89 eV * (1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.02 x 10^-19 J\n\nNow that we have the energy required to move the electron, we can find the wavelength of the emitted photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck constant (6.63 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for λ:\n\nλ = h * c / E\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nλ = (6.63 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.02 x 10^-19 J) = 6.57 x 10^-7 m\n\nConverting to nanometers:\n\nλ = 6.57 x 10^-7 m * (10^9 nm/m) = 657 nm\n\nSo, the energy required to move an electron from the n=2 energy level to the n=3 energy level in a hydrogen atom is 1.89 eV (or 3.02 x 10^-19 J), and the wavelength of the emitted photon is 657 nm."
