    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV, we can use the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), and p is the momentum of the electron.\n\nFirst, we need to find the momentum of the electron. We can do this by using the kinetic energy formula:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg), and v is the velocity of the electron.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for v:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * KE / m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 50 eV / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the kinetic energy from eV to Joules. 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 50 * 1.602 x 10^-19 J / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg))\nv ≈ 4.19 x 10^6 m/s\n\nNow that we have the velocity, we can find the momentum:\n\np = m * v\np ≈ (9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (4.19 x 10^6 m/s)\np ≈ 3.815 x 10^-24 kg m/s\n\nNow we can find the wavelength using the de Broglie wavelength formula:\n\nλ = h / p\nλ ≈ (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (3.815 x 10^-24 kg m/s)\nλ ≈ 1.736 x 10^-10 m\n\nSo the wavelength of the electron is approximately 1.736 x 10^-10 m.\n\nNow let's use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ h / (4 * π)\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and h is the Planck's constant.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for Δx:\n\nΔx ≥ h / (4 * π * Δp)\n\nSince the minimum uncertainty in momentum is equal to the momentum of the electron, we can use the value of p that we calculated earlier:\n\nΔx ≥ (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) / (4 * π * 3.815 x 10^-24 kg m/s)\nΔx ≥ 1.452 x 10^-10 m\n\nSo the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 1.452 x 10^-10 m.\n\nComparing the wavelength of the electron (1.736 x 10^-10 m) to the minimum uncertainty in its position (1.452 x 10^-10 m), we can see that they are of the same order of magnitude. This means that the electron's wave-like behavior is significant at this energy level, and its position cannot be precisely determined."
