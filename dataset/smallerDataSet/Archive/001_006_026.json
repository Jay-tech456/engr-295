    "message_2": "In a double-slit experiment, the probability distribution of a photon landing on a specific point on the screen is determined by the interference pattern created by the two slits. This interference pattern is a result of the superposition of the wave functions of the photon passing through each slit.\n\nThe probability distribution can be described by the intensity of the interference pattern, which is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the superposed wave functions. Mathematically, the intensity I(x) at a point x on the screen can be expressed as:\n\nI(x) ∝ [A1(x) + A2(x)]^2\n\nwhere A1(x) and A2(x) are the amplitudes of the wave functions of the photon passing through slit 1 and slit 2, respectively.\n\nFor a double-slit experiment with monochromatic light, the intensity distribution can be described by the following equation:\n\nI(x) = I0 [cos^2(πdsinθ/λ)]\n\nwhere I0 is the maximum intensity, d is the distance between the slits, θ is the angle between the central maximum and the point x on the screen, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nWhen the distance between the slits (d) is varied, the interference pattern changes. Specifically, as the distance between the slits increases, the fringe spacing (i.e., the distance between adjacent bright or dark fringes) decreases. This can be understood from the equation above, as the term (πdsinθ/λ) in the cosine function determines the fringe spacing. When d increases, the fringes become closer together, leading to a more closely spaced interference pattern.\n\nIn summary, the probability distribution of a photon landing on a specific point on the screen in a double-slit experiment is determined by the interference pattern created by the two slits. The distribution changes when the distance between the slits is varied, with the fringe spacing decreasing as the distance between the slits increases."
