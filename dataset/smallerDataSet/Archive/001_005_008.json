    "message_1": "Consider two entangled particles, A and B, that are separated by a distance of 10 meters. When a measurement is made on particle A, the state of particle B instantaneously changes in a non-local way, violating the principle of locality. Suppose that particle A is measured to be in the state |+x⟩, what is the probability that particle B is measured to be in the state |-y⟩?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of particle B being measured in the state |-y⟩ after particle A is measured in the state |+x⟩, we need to know the initial entangled state of the particles A and B. Let's assume the initial entangled state is given by:\n\n|Ψ⟩ = α |+x⟩_A |+y⟩_B + β |-x⟩_A |-y⟩_B\n\nwhere α and β are complex coefficients such that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.\n\nNow, when particle A is measured to be in the state |+x⟩, the entangled state collapses to:\n\n|Ψ'⟩ = |+x⟩_A |+y⟩_B\n\nTo find the probability of particle B being in the state |-y⟩, we need to calculate the overlap between the state |+y⟩_B and the state |-y⟩_B. Since these two states are orthogonal, their overlap is zero:\n\n⟨-y|+y⟩ = 0\n\nThus, the probability of measuring particle B in the state |-y⟩ after particle A is measured in the state |+x⟩ is 0."
