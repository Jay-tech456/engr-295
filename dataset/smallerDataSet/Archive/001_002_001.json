    "message_2": "According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ = h/(2π) and h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js).\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position (Δx) is 1 nm (1 x 10^(-9) m), we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the inequality:\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced Planck constant:\n\nħ = h/(2π) = (6.626 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2π) ≈ 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js\n\nNow, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n\nΔp ≥ (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 1 x 10^(-9) m) ≈ 5.27 x 10^(-26) kg m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of the electron is approximately 5.27 x 10^(-26) kg m/s."
