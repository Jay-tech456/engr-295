    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom from its ground state (n=1) to an unbound state (n=∞), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level, and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the ground state (n=1), the energy is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nFor the unbound state (n=∞), the energy is:\n\nE_∞ = -13.6 eV / ∞^2 = 0 eV\n\nThe energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom is the difference between these two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_∞ - E_1 = 0 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 13.6 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state to an unbound state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
