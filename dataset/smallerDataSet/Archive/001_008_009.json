    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the z-component of the spin of an electron in a state with spin angular momentum quantum number s=1/2 oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the z-axis, we can use the following formula:\n\n⟨Sz⟩ = s * cos(θ)\n\nwhere ⟨Sz⟩ is the expected value of the z-component of the spin, s is the spin angular momentum quantum number, and θ is the angle between the spin and the z-axis.\n\nGiven s = 1/2 and θ = 45 degrees, we can convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 45 * (π/180) = π/4\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n⟨Sz⟩ = (1/2) * cos(π/4)\n\nSince cos(π/4) = √2/2:\n\n⟨Sz⟩ = (1/2) * (√2/2) = √2/4\n\nSo, the expected value of the z-component of the spin of an electron in a state with spin angular momentum quantum number s=1/2 oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the z-axis is √2/4."
