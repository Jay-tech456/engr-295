Alice has two qubits in an entangled state, and the qubit she wants to send is in an unknown state. How can she use the entangled qubits and perform measurements on her qubit to send the unknown state to Bob without physically transferring the qubit itself? Show the step-by-step process and calculate the resulting state of the qubit after teleportation.",
    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, Alice wants to send an unknown qubit state |ψ⟩ to Bob. The unknown state can be represented as:\n\n|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n\nAlice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits in the Bell state:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nNow, Alice has three qubits: the unknown qubit |ψ⟩ and the two entangled qubits. The total state of the three qubits is:\n\n|Ψ_total⟩ = |ψ⟩ ⊗ |Φ+⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) ⊗ (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n\nExpanding the tensor product, we get:\n\n|Ψ_total⟩ = (1/√2)(α|000⟩ + α|011⟩ + β|100⟩ + β|111⟩)\n\nNext, Alice performs a Bell basis measurement on her two qubits (the unknown qubit and one of the entangled qubits). The Bell basis states are:\n\n|Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)\n|Φ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ - |11⟩)\n|Ψ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ + |10⟩)\n|Ψ-⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ - |10⟩)\n\nWe can rewrite the total state |Ψ_total⟩ in terms of the Bell basis states:\n\n|Ψ_total⟩ = (1/2)(|Φ+⟩(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) + |Φ-⟩(α|0⟩ - β|1⟩) + |Ψ+⟩(α|1⟩ + β|0⟩) + |Ψ-⟩(α|1⟩ - β|0⟩))\n\nAfter Alice's measurement, the state collapses to one of the four Bell states, and she sends the result of her measurement (2 classical bits of information) to Bob.\n\n1. If Alice measures |Φ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in the state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ (the original state |ψ⟩).\n2. If Alice measures |Φ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in the state α|0⟩ - β|1⟩. Bob applies a Z gate to recover the original state.\n3. If Alice measures |Ψ+⟩, Bob's qubit is in the state α|1⟩ + β|0⟩. Bob applies an X gate to recover the original state.\n4. If Alice measures |Ψ-⟩, Bob's qubit is in the state α|1⟩ - β|0⟩. Bob applies both X and Z gates to recover the original state.\n\nIn each case, Bob can recover the original unknown state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ by applying the appropriate gates based on Alice's measurement result. This is the process of quantum teleportation, where the unknown qubit state is transferred to Bob without physically transferring the qubit itself."
