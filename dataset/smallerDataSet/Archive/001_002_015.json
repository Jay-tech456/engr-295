    "message_2": "According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle is greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant (ħ/2). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nWhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position (Δx) as 1.0 x 10^-10 m, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by rearranging the equation:\n\nΔp ≥ ħ/(2 * Δx)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nΔp ≥ (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 1.0 x 10^-10 m)\n\nΔp ≥ 5.272859 x 10^-25 kg m/s\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of the electron is approximately 5.27 x 10^-25 kg m/s."
