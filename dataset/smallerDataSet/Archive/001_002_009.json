    "message_2": "To find the minimum uncertainty in the position and momentum of an electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nWe are given the wavelength (λ) of the electron, which is 0.2 nm. We can use the de Broglie wavelength formula to find the momentum (p) of the electron:\n\nλ = h / p\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant, approximately equal to 6.62607015 × 10^(-34) Js. Rearranging the formula to solve for p, we get:\n\np = h / λ\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\np = (6.62607015 × 10^(-34) Js) / (0.2 × 10^(-9) m)\np ≈ 3.313035075 × 10^(-24) kg m/s\n\nSince the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is equal to the momentum (p) in this case, we can now use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the uncertainty in position (Δx):\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\nΔx * (3.313035075 × 10^(-24) kg m/s) ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / 2\n\nNow, we can solve for Δx:\n\nΔx ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 3.313035075 × 10^(-24) kg m/s)\nΔx ≥ 7.975 × 10^(-11) m\n\nSo, the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron is approximately 7.975 × 10^(-11) m, and the minimum uncertainty in the momentum of the electron is approximately 3.313 × 10^(-24) kg m/s."
