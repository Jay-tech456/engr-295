    "message_2": "The ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * h_bar * omega\n\nwhere E_0 is the ground state energy, h_bar is the reduced Planck's constant, and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency, omega. The formula for omega is:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass of the oscillator. Plugging in the given values:\n\nomega = sqrt(4 N/m / 2 kg) = sqrt(2 s^(-2))\n\nNow, we need to find the reduced Planck's constant, h_bar. The value of h_bar is approximately:\n\nh_bar ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js\n\nNow we can calculate the ground state energy:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js) * sqrt(2 s^(-2))\nE_0 ≈ 7.450392 × 10^(-35) J\n\nSo, the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator is approximately 7.45 × 10^(-35) Joules."
