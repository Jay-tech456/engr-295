    "message_2": "To find the energy difference between the n=4 and n=2 energy levels of a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=4 energy level:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / 4^2 = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the electron in the n=2 energy level:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nThe energy difference between the n=4 and n=2 energy levels is:\n\nΔE = E_4 - E_2 = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from the n=4 to n=2 energy level. First, we need to convert the energy difference from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\n1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J\n\nΔE = 2.55 eV × 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV = 4.08556 × 10^(-19) J\n\nNext, we can use the Planck's equation to find the frequency of the photon:\n\nE = h × f\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), and f is the frequency of the photon.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the frequency:\n\nf = E / h = (4.08556 × 10^(-19) J) / (6.626 × 10^(-34) Js) = 6.165 × 10^14 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from the n=4 to n=2 energy level is approximately 6.165 × 10^14 Hz."
