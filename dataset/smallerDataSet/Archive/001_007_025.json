    "message_2": "In a 1D harmonic oscillator, the potential energy (U) is given by the formula:\n\nU = (1/2) * k * x^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium point.\n\nThe total energy (E) of the particle in the harmonic oscillator is the sum of its potential energy (U) and kinetic energy (K):\n\nE = U + K\n\nSince the particle's energy is given as 15 joules, and we want to find the maximum displacement, we need to consider the case when all of the energy is potential energy (i.e., when the particle is momentarily at rest at its maximum displacement). In this case, E = U, and K = 0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n15 J = (1/2) * 10 N/m * x^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n15 J = 5 N/m * x^2\n\nx^2 = 15 J / 5 N/m\n\nx^2 = 3 m^2\n\nx = sqrt(3 m^2)\n\nx = sqrt(3) m\n\nx â‰ˆ 1.73 m\n\nSo, the maximum displacement of the particle from the equilibrium point is approximately 1.73 meters."
