    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle in the ground state, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state), hbar is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.054 x 10^-34 J*s), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency omega. We can do this using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (120 N/m) and m is the mass of the particle (0.02 kg).\n\nomega = sqrt(120/0.02) = sqrt(6000) = 77.46 rad/s\n\nNow we can find the energy of the particle in the ground state (n = 0):\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * hbar * omega = (1/2) * (1.054 x 10^-34 J*s) * (77.46 rad/s) = 4.08 x 10^-33 J\n\nThe energy of the particle in the ground state is approximately 4.08 x 10^-33 J.\n\nTo find the frequency of oscillation, we can use the relationship between angular frequency and frequency:\n\nomega = 2 * pi * f\n\nwhere f is the frequency of oscillation.\n\nf = omega / (2 * pi) = 77.46 rad/s / (2 * pi) = 12.32 Hz\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is approximately 12.32 Hz."
