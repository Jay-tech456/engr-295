    "message_2": "The Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that can detect and correct single-qubit errors. It is a 7-qubit code, meaning it uses 7 physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit. Here's how the Steane code works:\n\n1. Encoding: The logical qubit |0> is encoded as |0000000>, and the logical qubit |1> is encoded as |1110000>. These encoded states are also known as the \"code words\" of the Steane code.\n\n2. Error detection: The Steane code uses six stabilizer generators to detect errors. These stabilizers are:\n\nS1 = X⊗X⊗X⊗I⊗I⊗I⊗I\nS2 = I⊗I⊗I⊗X⊗X⊗X⊗X\nS3 = X⊗I⊗X⊗X⊗I⊗X⊗I\nS4 = Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗I⊗I⊗I⊗I\nS5 = I⊗I⊗I⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z\nS6 = Z⊗I⊗Z⊗Z⊗I⊗Z⊗I\n\nHere, X and Z are Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix. By measuring these stabilizers, we can detect errors in the qubits without collapsing the quantum state.\n\n3. Error correction: Once an error is detected, we can use the syndrome measurement outcomes to determine which qubit is affected and apply the appropriate correction operation (either X, Z, or both).\n\nSo, the minimum number of qubits required to encode a single logical qubit using the Steane code is 7 qubits. This code can detect and correct single-qubit errors, making it a valuable tool for improving the reliability of quantum computations."
