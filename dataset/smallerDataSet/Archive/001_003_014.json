    "message_2": "To determine the probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier, we will use the transmission coefficient T, which can be calculated using the following formula for a rectangular potential barrier:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V^2 * sinh^2(k2 * a)) / (4 * E * (V - E)))\n\nwhere V is the potential barrier height, E is the energy of the particle, a is the width of the barrier, and k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier. The wave vector k2 can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = 1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js).\n\nFirst, let's calculate k2:\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 1.5 x 10^-27 kg * (2.8 x 10^-19 J - 1.2 x 10^-19 J) / (1.0545718 x 10^-34 Js)^2)\nk2 ≈ 1.103 x 10^10 m^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission coefficient T:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (2.8 x 10^-19 J)^2 * sinh^2(1.103 x 10^10 m^-1 * 4 x 10^-11 m) / (4 * 1.2 x 10^-19 J * (2.8 x 10^-19 J - 1.2 x 10^-19 J)))\nT ≈ 0.0016\n\nThe probability of the particle tunneling through the barrier is approximately 0.16%."
