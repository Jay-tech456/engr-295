    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the Schrödinger equation for the system.\n2. Find the general solution for the wave function in terms of Hermite polynomials.\n3. Determine the energy spectrum of the system.\n4. Write down the corresponding wave functions.\n5. Plot the first three wave functions and discuss their physical significance.\n\n1. Schrödinger equation for the system:\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional system is given by:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2m) (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nFor the given harmonic oscillator potential, V(x) = (1/2)kx^2, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2m) (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + (1/2)kx^2ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\n2. General solution for the wave function in terms of Hermite polynomials:\n\nTo solve this equation, we introduce a dimensionless variable ξ = (mωx / ħ)^(1/2), where ω = (k/m)^(1/2) is the angular frequency of the oscillator. The Schrödinger equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(d^2ψ(ξ) / dξ^2) - 2ξ(dψ(ξ) / dξ) + (2ε - 1)ψ(ξ) = 0\n\nwhere ε = E / (ħω).\n\nThe general solution to this equation is given by:\n\nψ(ξ) = N * H_n(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\n\nwhere N is a normalization constant, H_n(ξ) are the Hermite polynomials, and n is a non-negative integer.\n\n3. Energy spectrum of the system:\n\nThe energy spectrum is given by the quantized energy levels:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n4. Corresponding wave functions:\n\nThe wave functions corresponding to the energy levels are given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = N_n * H_n(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\n\nwhere N_n is the normalization constant for the nth energy level.\n\n5. Plot the first three wave functions and discuss their physical significance:\n\nThe first three wave functions are given by:\n\nψ_0(x) = N_0 * H_0(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2) = N_0 * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\nψ_1(x) = N_1 * H_1(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2) = N_1 * ξ * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\nψ_2(x) = N_2 * H_2(ξ) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2) = N_2 * (2ξ^2 - 1) * exp(-ξ^2 / 2)\n\nThe physical significance of these wave functions is as follows:\n\n- ψ_0(x) represents the ground state of the harmonic oscillator, with the lowest energy level E_0 = (1/2)ħω. The particle is most likely to be found near the center of the potential well, and the wave function is symmetric about the center.\n\n- ψ_1(x) represents the first excited state with energy level E_1 = (3/2)ħω. The wave function has one node at the center of the potential well, and the probability density is higher on either side of the center. The wave function is antisymmetric about the center.\n\n- ψ_2(x) represents the second excited state with energy level E_2 = (5/2)ħω. The wave function has two nodes and is symmetric about the center. The probability density is higher at three regions: the center and two regions symmetrically placed around the center.\n\nIn general, the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator represent different energy levels and spatial distributions of the particle in the potential well. The number of nodes in the wave function increases with the energy level, and the wave functions alternate between symmetric and antisymmetric about the center."
