    "message_2": "The magnetic moment (µ) of an electron is related to its spin angular momentum (S) by the following equation:\n\nµ = -g * (e / 2m) * S\n\nwhere g is the electron's g-factor (approximately 2 for an electron), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^(-19) C), and m is the electron's mass (9.1 × 10^(-31) kg).\n\nA Bohr magneton (µ_B) is a unit of magnetic moment, and it is defined as:\n\nµ_B = (e * ħ) / (2m)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (1.05 × 10^(-34) Js).\n\nGiven that the magnetic moment of the electron is -1.5 Bohr magnetons, we can write:\n\nµ = -1.5 * µ_B\n\nNow, we can solve for the spin angular momentum (S):\n\nS = - (µ * 2m) / (g * e)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nS = - (-1.5 * (1.6 × 10^(-19) C * 1.05 × 10^(-34) Js) / (2 * 9.1 × 10^(-31) kg)) / (2 * 1.6 × 10^(-19) C)\n\nS = (1.5 * 1.05 × 10^(-34) Js) / (9.1 × 10^(-31) kg)\n\nS ≈ 2.32 × 10^(-4) Js/kg\n\nThe spin angular momentum of the electron in a magnetic field of strength 1 T with a magnetic moment of -1.5 Bohr magnetons is approximately 2.32 × 10^(-4) Js/kg."
