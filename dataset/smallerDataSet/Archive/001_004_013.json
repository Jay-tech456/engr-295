    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to move an electron from one energy level to another in a hydrogen atom, we can use the following formula:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy difference between the two energy levels, E_final is the energy of the final energy level (n=3), and E_initial is the energy of the initial energy level (n=2).\n\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron in the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the initial energy level (n=2):\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy of the final energy level (n=3):\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 = -1.51 eV\n\nNow we can find the energy difference between the two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = -1.51 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 1.89 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to move an electron from the n=2 energy level to the n=3 energy level in the hydrogen atom is 1.89 eV."
