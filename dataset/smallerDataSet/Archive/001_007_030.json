    "message_2": "The ground state energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n\nE_0 = (1/2)ħω\n\nwhere E_0 is the ground state energy, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator. The angular frequency is related to the spring constant (k) and the mass (m) by the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency:\n\nω = √(k/m) = √(5 N/m / 0.1 kg) = √(50 s^(-2)) = 5√2 s^(-1)\n\nNow, we can find the ground state energy using the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js):\n\nE_0 = (1/2)ħω = (1/2)(1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)(5√2 s^(-1))\n\nE_0 ≈ 3.726946 × 10^(-34) J\n\nSo, the ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator is approximately 3.73 × 10^(-34) Joules."
