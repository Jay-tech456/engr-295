    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of fringes observed in a double-slit interference pattern, we can use the formula for the angular separation between fringes:\n\nθ = m * (λ / d)\n\nwhere θ is the angular separation between fringes, m is the order of the fringe (an integer), λ is the wavelength of the electrons, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nIn this case, λ = 2.5 nm = 2.5 * 10^(-9) m, and d = 0.1 mm = 0.1 * 10^(-3) m.\n\nThe maximum angle θ_max occurs when the fringes reach the edge of the detector. Since the distance from the slits to the detector (L) is 1 m, we can use the small angle approximation:\n\ntan(θ_max) ≈ θ_max = (detector height / 2) / L\n\nAssuming the detector height is much smaller than the distance L, we can find the maximum order m_max:\n\nm_max * (λ / d) = (detector height / 2) / L\n\nm_max = (detector height / 2) * (d / λ) / L\n\nWithout knowing the detector height, we cannot find an exact value for m_max. However, if we assume the detector height is small enough, we can find an approximate value for m_max:\n\nm_max ≈ (d / λ) / 2\n\nm_max ≈ (0.1 * 10^(-3) m) / (2.5 * 10^(-9) m) / 2 ≈ 20000\n\nSo, the maximum number of fringes observed in the double-slit interference pattern is approximately 20,000. However, this value depends on the detector height and may vary."
