    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of quantum tunneling. In quantum mechanics, particles can tunnel through potential barriers even if their energy is less than the potential barrier's height. The probability of tunneling depends on the properties of the barrier and the particle.\n\nFirst, let's find the transmission probability T, which is the probability that the particle will tunnel through the barrier. We can use the formula for the transmission probability of a rectangular potential barrier:\n\nT = e^(-2 * K * L)\n\nwhere K is the wave number inside the barrier and L is the width of the barrier. The wave number K can be calculated as:\n\nK = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, V is the height of the potential barrier, E is the energy of the particle, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / (2 * pi), where h is the Planck constant).\n\nNow, let's find the escape velocity v_esc. The escape velocity is the minimum velocity required for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a massive body. The formula for escape velocity is:\n\nv_esc = sqrt(2 * G * M / R)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the massive body, and R is the distance from the center of the massive body to the object.\n\nThe particle will emerge with a velocity greater than the escape velocity if its kinetic energy after tunneling is greater than the kinetic energy corresponding to the escape velocity. The kinetic energy of the particle after tunneling is:\n\nK.E. = E - V\n\nThe kinetic energy corresponding to the escape velocity is:\n\nK.E._esc = (1/2) * m * v_esc^2\n\nFor the particle to emerge with a velocity greater than the escape velocity, we need:\n\nE - V > (1/2) * m * v_esc^2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the particle will tunnel through the barrier and emerge with a velocity greater than the escape velocity. This probability is given by the product of the transmission probability T and the probability that the particle's kinetic energy after tunneling is greater than the kinetic energy corresponding to the escape velocity:\n\nP = T * P(K.E. > K.E._esc)\n\nSince we have the expression for T and the condition for the particle's kinetic energy to be greater than the escape velocity, we can calculate the probability P. However, without specific values for the parameters (m, E, V, L, G, M, R), we cannot provide a numerical value for the probability."
