    "message_2": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization that runs in polynomial time. The time complexity of Shor's algorithm is O((log N)^3), where N is the number to be factored. This is significantly faster than the best-known classical algorithms for factorization, which have exponential or sub-exponential time complexity.\n\nShor's algorithm utilizes quantum properties in two main steps:\n\n1. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): Shor's algorithm uses QFT to find the period of a function, which is a crucial step in the factorization process. QFT can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, with a time complexity of O((log N)^2). Classical algorithms for finding the period of a function are generally much slower, with exponential time complexity.\n\n2. Quantum parallelism and superposition: Quantum computers can perform calculations on multiple inputs simultaneously due to the property of superposition. In Shor's algorithm, this allows the quantum computer to evaluate the function for many different input values at once, significantly speeding up the process of finding the period.\n\nBy leveraging these quantum properties, Shor's algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers, which has significant implications for cryptography and security, as many cryptographic systems rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers."
