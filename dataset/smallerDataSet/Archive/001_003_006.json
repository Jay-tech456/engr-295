    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the quantum mechanical tunneling phenomenon, which can be described by the transmission probability. For a rectangular potential barrier, the transmission probability can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (V^2 * sinh^2(k2 * d)) / (4 * E * (V - E)))\n\nwhere T is the transmission probability, V is the height of the potential barrier, E is the energy of the particle, d is the width of the barrier, and k2 is the wave vector inside the barrier. The wave vector k2 can be calculated using the formula:\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * m * (V - E) / hbar^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, and hbar is the reduced Planck constant (hbar = h / (2 * pi), where h is the Planck constant).\n\nAssuming the particle is an electron, we have the following values:\n\n- E = 10 eV\n- V = 5 eV\n- d = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m\n- m (mass of electron) = 9.10938356e-31 kg\n- hbar = 1.0545718e-34 Js\n\nNow, we can calculate k2:\n\nk2 = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 * (5 - 10) / 1.0545718e-34) = 1.387e10 m^-1\n\nNow, we can calculate the transmission probability T:\n\nT = 1 / (1 + (5^2 * sinh^2(1.387e10 * 1e-10)) / (4 * 10 * (5 - 10)))\nT â‰ˆ 0.000125\n\nSo, the probability that the particle with an energy of 10 eV will penetrate a potential barrier of height 5 eV and width 0.1 nm is approximately 0.000125 or 0.0125%."
