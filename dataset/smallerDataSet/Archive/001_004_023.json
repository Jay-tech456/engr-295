    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required to move an electron in a hydrogen atom from the ground state (n1 = 1) to the first excited state (n2 = 2), we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/n2^2 - 1/n1^2)\n\nPlugging in the values for n1 and n2:\n\nΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/2^2 - 1/1^2) = -13.6 eV * (1/4 - 1) = -13.6 eV * (-3/4) = 10.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy required to move the electron from the ground state to the first excited state is 10.2 electron volts (eV).\n\nNow, when the electron falls back to the ground state, it will emit a photon with the same energy as the energy difference between the two states. To find the wavelength of this photon, we can use the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy from eV to Joules:\n\nE = 10.2 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.634 x 10^-18 J\n\nNow, we can solve for the wavelength:\n\nλ = h * c / E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (1.634 x 10^-18 J) = 1.215 x 10^-7 m\n\nThe wavelength of the photon emitted when the electron falls back to the ground state is approximately 1.215 x 10^-7 meters, or 121.5 nm. This falls in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum."
