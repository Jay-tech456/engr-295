    "message_2": "The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle, such as an electron, experiences a phase shift due to the presence of a magnetic field, even if the particle does not pass through the region where the magnetic field is non-zero. In this case, we have an electron moving around a long solenoid with a constant magnetic field inside it.\n\nThe phase shift experienced by the electron can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nΔφ = (e / ħ) ∮ A · dl\n\nHere, Δφ is the phase shift, e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6 × 10^(-19) C), ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 × 10^(-34) Js), A is the magnetic vector potential, and dl is the infinitesimal path length element along the electron's path.\n\nFor a long solenoid, the magnetic vector potential A can be expressed as:\n\nA = (μ₀ n I / 2πr) φ̂\n\nHere, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, I is the current flowing through the solenoid, r is the distance from the center of the solenoid to the electron, and φ̂ is the azimuthal unit vector.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for A into the formula for the phase shift:\n\nΔφ = (e / ħ) ∮ [(μ₀ n I / 2πr) φ̂] · dl\n\nSince the electron is moving around the solenoid, we can integrate over a closed loop, which gives:\n\nΔφ = (e / ħ) (μ₀ n I / 2π) ∮ (1 / r) dl\n\nThe integral ∮ (1 / r) dl is equal to the total circulation of the inverse radial distance around the solenoid, which is equal to 2π for a complete loop. Therefore, we have:\n\nΔφ = (e / ħ) (μ₀ n I / 2π) (2π)\n\nThe 2π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nΔφ = (e / ħ) (μ₀ n I)\n\nThis expression shows that the phase shift experienced by the electron depends on the strength of the magnetic field inside the solenoid (which is proportional to the product of μ₀, n, and I) and is independent of the distance between the solenoid and the electron (r)."
