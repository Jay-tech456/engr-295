    "message_2": "When an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from a higher energy level (n=4) to a lower energy level (n=1), it can do so in multiple steps, emitting a photon at each step. The maximum number of photons emitted occurs when the electron transitions through all possible intermediate energy levels.\n\nFor hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level and eV (electron volts) is the unit of energy.\n\nFor the n=4 level, the energy is:\n\nE_4 = -13.6 eV / 4^2 = -13.6 eV / 16 ≈ -0.85 eV\n\nFor the n=1 level, the energy is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nThe energy difference between these two levels is:\n\nΔE = E_1 - E_4 ≈ -13.6 eV - (-0.85 eV) ≈ -12.75 eV\n\nThe electron can transition from n=4 to n=1 through the following steps:\n\n1. n=4 to n=3\n2. n=3 to n=2\n3. n=2 to n=1\n\nThis means that the maximum number of photons that can be emitted is 3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy of each emitted photon:\n\n1. Transition from n=4 to n=3:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 ≈ -1.51 eV\nΔE_4-3 = E_3 - E_4 ≈ -1.51 eV - (-0.85 eV) ≈ -0.66 eV\n\n2. Transition from n=3 to n=2:\n\nE_2 = -13.6 eV / 2^2 ≈ -3.4 eV\nΔE_3-2 = E_2 - E_3 ≈ -3.4 eV - (-1.51 eV) ≈ -1.89 eV\n\n3. Transition from n=2 to n=1:\n\nΔE_2-1 = E_1 - E_2 ≈ -13.6 eV - (-3.4 eV) ≈ -10.2 eV\n\nSo, the maximum number of photons that can be emitted is 3, with energies of approximately -0.66 eV, -1.89 eV, and -10.2 eV."
