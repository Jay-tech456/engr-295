    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle in the ground state, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * hbar * omega\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the quantum number (0 for the ground state), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10^(-34) Js), and omega is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency omega. We can do this using the formula:\n\nomega = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (5 N/m) and m is the mass of the particle (2 kg).\n\nomega = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(2.5) = 1.5811 rad/s\n\nNow we can find the energy of the particle in the ground state (n = 0):\n\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2) * hbar * omega\nE_0 = (1/2) * (1.054 x 10^(-34) Js) * (1.5811 rad/s)\nE_0 = 8.321 x 10^(-35) J\n\nSo the energy of the particle in the ground state is approximately 8.321 x 10^(-35) Joules.\n\nNext, we can find the period of oscillation T using the formula:\n\nT = 2 * pi / omega\n\nT = 2 * pi / 1.5811\nT = 3.976 s\n\nSo the period of oscillation is approximately 3.976 seconds."
