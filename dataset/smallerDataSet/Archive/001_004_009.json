    "message_2": "To calculate the energy required for an electron to jump from one energy level to another in a hydrogen atom, we can use the formula for the energy difference between two energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\n\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the electron at the nth energy level and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the electron at the initial (n=2) and final (n=4) energy levels:\n\nE_initial (n=2) = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV\n\nE_final (n=4) = -13.6 eV / (4^2) = -13.6 eV / 16 = -0.85 eV\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy difference:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = -0.85 eV - (-3.4 eV) = 2.55 eV\n\nSo, the energy required for an electron to jump from the n=2 energy level to the n=4 energy level in the hydrogen atom is 2.55 eV."
