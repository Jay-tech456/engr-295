    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well, we first need to determine the wavefunction for the particle in the ground state. For an infinite square well, the potential energy is zero inside the well (between 0 and L) and infinite outside the well. The Schrödinger equation for the particle in the well is given by:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy of the particle, and ψ(x) is the wavefunction.\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k is the wave number, related to the energy by:\n\nE = (ħ^2 * k^2) / (2m)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0, we find that B = 0 and k = n * π / L, where n is a positive integer. For the ground state, n = 1. Thus, the wavefunction for the ground state is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(πx / L)\n\nTo normalize the wavefunction, we require that the integral of the probability density (|ψ(x)|^2) over the entire well is equal to 1:\n\n∫[0 to L] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1\n\nSolving for A, we find that A = sqrt(2 / L). Therefore, the normalized ground state wavefunction is:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2 / L) * sin(πx / L)\n\nThe probability density distribution is given by |ψ(x)|^2:\n\nP(x) = 2 / L * sin^2(πx / L)\n\nThe energy of the particle in the ground state (n = 1) can be calculated using the energy formula:\n\nE = (ħ^2 * k^2) / (2m) = (ħ^2 * (π / L)^2) / (2m)\n\nSince the particle is in the ground state, the probability of finding it in the well is 100%, as it cannot exist outside the well due to the infinite potential barrier. The energy of the particle in the ground state and the probability density distribution have been calculated above."
