    "message_2": "In the quantum teleportation protocol, the minimum number of entangled qubits required to successfully transmit the state of a single qubit from one location to another with 100% accuracy is two.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n1. Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, which are prepared in a Bell state. This entangled pair consists of two qubits, one held by Alice (qubit A) and the other held by Bob (qubit B).\n\n2. Alice has a third qubit (qubit C), which is the qubit she wants to transmit to Bob. She performs a joint measurement on qubit A and qubit C, which projects them onto one of the four Bell states. This measurement entangles qubit A and qubit C and destroys the original state of qubit C.\n\n3. Alice sends the classical information about the measurement result (two classical bits) to Bob through a classical communication channel.\n\n4. Based on the information received from Alice, Bob performs a unitary operation on his qubit (qubit B) to transform it into the state of the original qubit C. This operation can be one of the four possible operations: identity, bit-flip, phase-flip, or both bit-flip and phase-flip.\n\n5. After the unitary operation, Bob's qubit is now in the same state as Alice's original qubit C, and the quantum teleportation is complete.\n\nIn summary, the minimum number of entangled qubits required for quantum teleportation is two, which form the entangled pair shared by Alice and Bob. This entangled pair is essential for the protocol, as it allows the successful transmission of the state of a single qubit from one location to another with 100% accuracy."
